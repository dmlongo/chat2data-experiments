The Ferromagnetic Potts model under an external magnetic field: an exact renormalization group approach,"The q-state ferromagnetic Potts model under a non-zero magnetic field coupled with the 0^th Potts state was investigated by an exact real-space renormalization group approach. The model was defined on a family of diamond hierarchical lattices of several fractal dimensions d_F. On these lattices, the renormalization group transformations became exact for such a model when a correlation coupling that singles out the 0^th Potts state was included in the Hamiltonian. The rich criticality presented by the model with q=3 and d_F=2 was fully analyzed. Apart from the Potts criticality for the zero field, an Ising-like phase transition was found whenever the system was submitted to a strong reverse magnetic field. Unusual characteristics such as cusps and dimensional reduction were observed on the critical surface.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,Boosting Transparency in Topological Josephson Junctions via Stencil Lithography,"Hybrid devices comprised of topological insulator (TI) nanostructures in proximity to s-wave superconductors (SC) are expected to pave the way towards topological quantum computation. Fabrication under ultra-high vacuum conditions is necessary to attain high quality of TI-SC hybrid devices, because the physical surfaces of V-VI three-dimensional TIs suffer from degradation at ambient conditions. Here, we present an in-situ process, which allows to fabricate such hybrids by combining molecular beam epitaxy and stencil lithography. As-prepared Josephson junctions show nearly perfect interface transparency and very large $I_CR_N$ products. The Shapiro response of radio frequency measurements indicates the presence of gapless Andreev bound states, so-called Majorana bound states.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,0
Proper-time measurement in accelerated relativistic systems,"Separate constituents of extended systems measure proper-times on different world-lines. Relating and comparing proper-time measurements along any two such world-lines requires that common simultaneity be possible, which in turn implies that the system is linearly-rigidly moving so that momentary rest frames are identifiable at any stage of the system's journey in space-time. Once momentary rest-frames have been identified, clocks moving on separate world-lines are synchronizable by light-signal communication. The synchronization relations for two clocks are explicitly computed using light-signals exchanged between them. Implications for the clock hypothesis are included. Also, since simultaneity is frame-dependent, incorrect usage of it leads to pseudo-paradoxes. Counter-examples are discussed.",physics,physics.class-ph,Unsupervised Full-color Cellular Image Reconstruction through Disordered Optical Fiber,"Recent years have witnessed the tremendous development of fusing fiber-optic imaging with supervised deep learning to enable high-quality imaging of hard-to-reach areas. Nevertheless, the supervised deep learning method imposes strict constraints on fiber-optic imaging systems, where the input objects and the fiber outputs have to be collected in pairs. To unleash the full potential of fiber-optic imaging, unsupervised image reconstruction is in demand. Unfortunately, neither optical fiber bundles nor multimode fibers can achieve a point-to-point transmission of the object with a high sampling density, as is a prerequisite for unsupervised image reconstruction. The recently proposed disordered fibers offer a new solution based on the transverse Anderson localization. Here, we demonstrate unsupervised full-color imaging with a cellular resolution through a meter-long disordered fiber in both transmission and reflection modes. The unsupervised image reconstruction consists of two stages. In the first stage, we perform a pixel-wise standardization on the fiber outputs using the statistics of the objects. In the second stage, we recover the fine details of the reconstructions through a generative adversarial network. Unsupervised image reconstruction does not need paired images, enabling a much more flexible calibration under various conditions. Our new solution achieves full-color high-fidelity cell imaging within a working distance of at least 4 mm by only collecting the fiber outputs after an initial calibration. High imaging robustness is also demonstrated when the disordered fiber is bent with a central angle of 60{\deg}. Moreover, the cross-domain generality on unseen objects is shown to be enhanced with a diversified object set.",physics,physics.optics,0
Searching for orbital decay in a heartbeat star system KIC 3766353,"Theory suggests that the orbits of a large fraction of binary systems, including planet-star binary systems, shrink by few orders of magnitude after formation. But so far, only one hot Jupiter with tidally-driven orbital decay has been found by transit timing variations. We propose to search for orbital decay companions in heartbeat star systems because the orbital angular momentum is effectively transferred to the host star causing tidal dissipation. KIC 3766353 is one of the heartbeat stars with tidally excited oscillations. We acquired the primary and the secondary eclipse time variations from the \textit{Kepler} photometric light curves. Timing analysis shows that KIC 3766353 is a hierarchical triple system with a hidden third body and a red dwarf (mass $0.35\ M_{\odot}$, radius $0.34\ R_{\odot}$) in its inner orbit. The minimum mass of the third body is $\sim 0.26 \ M_{\odot}$, and the distance from the inner orbital is $\sim 111.4 \ R_{\odot}$. The period decay rate of the red dwarf is approximately 358 ms yr$^{-1}$. The combined effects of the light-travel time and the orbital decay lead to the observed timing variations. Future monitoring with a long time base-line observations is required to delve into the contributions of these two effects.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Polar Ring Galaxies in the Galaxy Zoo,"We report observations of 16 candidate polar ring galaxies (PRGs) identified by the Galaxy Zoo project in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database. Deep images of five galaxies are available in the SDSS Stripe82 database, while to reach similar depth we observed the remaining galaxies with the 1.8-m Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope. We derive integrated magnitudes and u-r colours for the host and ring components and show continuum-subtracted H\alpha+[NII] images for seven objects. We present a basic morphological and environmental analysis of the galaxies and discuss their properties in comparison with other types of early-type galaxies. Follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations will allow a kinematic confirmation of the nature of these systems and a more detailed analysis of their stellar populations.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,0
Quantitative Method for the Optimal Subtraction of Continuum Emission from Narrow-band Images : Skewness Transition Analysis,"We present an objective method to remove the stellar continuum emission from narrow-band images to derive emission-line images. The method is based on the skewness of the pixel histogram of the residual images. Specifically, we exploit a transition in the skewness of the signal in the continuum-subtracted image, which appears when the image changes from being under-subtracted to over-subtracted. Tests on one-dimensional artificial images demonstrate that the transition identifies the optimal scaling factor {\mu} to be used on the broad-band image IB in order to produce the optimal line-emission image IE, i.e., IE =IN - {\mu} IB, with IN the original (un-subtracted) narrow-band image. The advantage of this method is that it uses all information-bearing pixels in the final image, and not just a sub-set of those pixels (the latter being common in many traditional approaches to stellar continuum removal from narrow-band images). We apply our method to actual images, both from ground-based and space facilities, in particular to WFPC2 and ACS images from the Hubble Space Telescope, and we show that it is successful irrespective of the nature of the sources (point-like or extended). We also discuss the impact on the accuracy of the method of non-optimal images, such as those containing saturated sources or non-uniform background, and present `workarounds' for those problems.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,Variability in Quasar Broad Absorption Line Outflows I. Trends in the Short-Term versus Long-Term Data,"Broad absorption lines (BALs) in quasar spectra identify high velocity outflows that likely exist in all quasars and could play a major role in feedback to galaxy evolution. The variability of BALs can help us understand the structure, evolution, and basic physical properties of the outflows. Here we report on our first results from an ongoing BAL monitoring campaign of a sample of 24 luminous quasars at redshifts 1.2<z<2.9, focusing on C IV 1549 BAL variability in two different time intervals: 4 to 9 months (short-term) and 3.8 to 7.7 years (long-term) in the quasar rest-frame. We find that 39% (7/18) of the quasars varied in the short-term, whereas 65% (15/23) varied in the long-term, with a larger typical change in strength in the long-term data. The variability occurs typically in only portions of the BAL troughs. The components at higher outflow velocities are more likely to vary than those at lower velocities, and weaker BALs are more likely to vary than stronger BALs. The fractional change in BAL strength correlates inversely with the strength of the BAL feature, but does not correlate with the outflow velocity. Both the short-term and long-term data indicate the same trends. The observed behavior is most readily understood as a result of the movement of clouds across the continuum source. If the crossing speeds do not exceed the local Keplerian velocity, then the observed short-term variations imply that the absorbers are <6 pc from the central quasar.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,0
Koopman Operator and Phase Space Partition of Chaotic Maps,"Koopman operator describes evolution of observables in the phase space, which could be used to extract characteristic dynamical features of a nonlinear system. Here, we show that it is possible to carry out interesting symbolic partitions based on properly constructed eigenfunctions of the operator for chaotic maps. The partition boundaries are the extrema of these eigenfunctions, the accuracy of which is improved by including more basis functions in the numerical computation. The validity of this scheme is demonstrated in well-known 1-d and 2-d maps. It seems no obstacle to extend the computation to nonlinear systems of high dimensions, which provides a possible way of dissecting complex dynamics.",nlin,nlin.CD,Transport of Coupled Self-propelled Particles with Gaussian Colored Noise,"The transport of coupled self-propelled particles with colored noise and potential is investigated. Large translational motion noise intensity is good for the transport in $-x$ direction, but large self-correlation time of translational motion noise will inhibit this transport. For proper value of the asymmetry parameter, coupled passive particles move always in $-x$ direction with increasing angle noise intensity, but coupled self-propelled particles appear the transport reverse phenomenon with increasing angle noise intensity. Large length of the spring is good for the directional transport. The average velocity has a maximum and a minimum with increasing spring constant $k$. For passive and very small self-propelled speed coupled particles, large number of particle is good for directional movement, but the effect of coupling will become weak when the self-propelled speed is large.",nlin,nlin.AO,0
Non-linear acceleration at supernova remnant shocks and the hardening in the cosmic ray spectrum,"In the last few years several experiments have shown that the cosmic ray spectrum below the knee is not a perfect power-law. In particular, the proton and helium spectra show a spectral hardening by ~ 0.1-0.2 in spectral index at particle energies of ~ 200-300 GeV/nucleon. Moreover, the helium spectrum is found to be harder than that of protons by ~ 0.1 and some evidence for a similar hardening was also found in the spectra of heavier elements. Here we consider the possibility that the hardening may be the result of a dispersion in the slope of the spectrum of cosmic rays accelerated at supernova remnant shocks. Such a dispersion is indeed expected within the framework of non-linear theories of diffusive shock acceleration, which predict steeper (harder) particle spectra for larger (smaller) cosmic ray acceleration efficiencies.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Beyond Einstein-Cartan gravity: Quadratic torsion and curvature invariants with even and odd parity including all boundary terms,"Recently, gravitational gauge theories with torsion have been discussed by an increasing number of authors from a classical as well as from a quantum field theoretical point of view. The Einstein-Cartan(-Sciama-Kibble) Lagrangian has been enriched by the parity odd pseudoscalar curvature (Hojman, Mukku, and Sayed) and by torsion square and curvature square pieces, likewise of even and odd parity. (i) We show that the inverse of the so-called Barbero-Immirzi parameter multiplying the pseudoscalar curvature, because of the topological Nieh-Yan form, can only be appropriately discussed if torsion square pieces are included. (ii) The quadratic gauge Lagrangian with both parities, proposed by Obukhov et al. and Baekler et al., emerges also in the framework of Diakonov et al.(2011). We establish the exact relations between both approaches by applying the topological Euler and Pontryagin forms in a Riemann-Cartan space expressed for the first time in terms of irreducible pieces of the curvature tensor. (iii) Only in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime, that is, in a spacetime with torsion, parity violating terms can be brought into the gravitational Lagrangian in a straightforward and natural way. Accordingly, Riemann-Cartan spacetime is a natural habitat for chiral fermionic matter fields.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,0
Strange nonchaos in self-excited singing flames,"We report the first experimental evidence of strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA) in the natural dynamics of a self-excited laboratory-scale system. In the previous experimental studies, the birth of SNA was observed in quasiperiodically forced systems; however, such an evidence of SNA in an autonomous laboratory system is yet to be reported. We discover the presence of SNA in between the attractors of quasiperiodicity and chaos through a fractalization route in a laboratory thermoacoustic system. The observed dynamical transitions from order to chaos via SNA is confirmed through various nonlinear characterization methods prescribed for the detection of SNA.",nlin,nlin.AO,Boussinesq Solitary-Wave as a Multiple-Time Solution of the Korteweg-de Vries Hierarchy,"We study the Boussinesq equation from the point of view of a multiple-time reductive perturbation method. As a consequence of the elimination of the secular producing terms through the use of the Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy, we show that the solitary--wave of the Boussinesq equation is a solitary--wave satisfying simultaneously all equations of the Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy, each one in an appropriate slow time variable.",nlin,nlin.PS,0
Light-induced anomalous Hall effect in massless Dirac fermion systems and topological insulators with dissipation,"Employing the quantum Liouville equation with phenomenological dissipation, we investigate the transport properties of massless and massive Dirac fermion systems that mimics graphene and topological insulators, respectively. The massless Dirac fermion system does not show an intrinsic Hall effect, but it shows a Hall current under the presence of circularly-polarized laser fields as a nature of a optically-driven nonequilibrium state. Based on the microscopic analysis, we find that the light-induced Hall effect mainly originates from the imbalance of photocarrier distribution in momentum space although the emergent Floquet-Berry curvature also has a non-zero contribution. We further compute the Hall transport property of the massive Dirac fermion system with an intrinsic Hall effect in order to investigate the interplay of the intrinsic topological contribution and the extrinsic light-induced population contribution. As a result, we find that the contribution from the photocarrier population imbalance becomes significant in the strong field regime and it overcomes the intrinsic contribution. This finding clearly demonstrates that intrinsic transport properties of materials can be overwritten by external driving and may open a way to ultrafast optical-control of transport properties of materials.",physics,physics.optics,One-Loop Fluctuation Entropy of Charge Inversion in DNA,"Experiments have revealed correlation-driven behavior of DNA in charged solutions, including charge inversion and condensation. This paper presents calculations of a lattice-gas model of charge inversion for the adsorption of charged dimers on DNA. Each adsorption site is assumed to have either a vacancy or a positively-charged dimer attached with the dimer oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the double helix DNA chain. The entropy and charge distributions of these three species are calculated including the lowest order fluctuation corrections to mean-field theory. We find that the inclusion of the fluctuation terms has a significant effect on the entropy, primarily in the regime where the dimers are repelled from the DNA molecule and compete with the chemical potential in solution.",physics,physics.bio-ph,0
A dark energy view of inflation,"Traditionally, inflationary models are analyzed in terms of parameters such as the scalar spectral index ns and the tensor to scalar ratio r, while dark energy models are studied in terms of the equation of state parameter w. Motivated by the fact that both deal with periods of accelerated expansion, we study the evolution of w during inflation, in order to derive observational constraints on its value during an earlier epoch likely dominated by a dynamic form of dark energy. We find that the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure data is consistent with w_inflation=-1 and provides an upper limit of 1+w <~ 0.02. Nonetheless, an exact de Sitter expansion with a constant w=-1 is disfavored since this would result in ns=1.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,When and how does ram pressure stripping in low-mass satellite galaxies enhance star formation,"We investigate how a satellite's star formation rate (SFR) and surviving gas respond to ram pressure stripping in various environments. Using a suite of high-resolution ""wind-tunnel"" simulations with radiative cooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback, we model the first infall orbit of a low-mass disk galaxy ($M_{*} = 10^{9.7} M_{\odot}$) in different host halos, ranging from Milky Way-like to cluster hosts. When the ram pressure is moderate, we find that the stripping satellite shows an enhanced SFR relative to the isolated control case, despite gas loss due to stripping. The SFR enhancement is caused, not directly by compression, but by ram pressure-driven mass flows, which can increase the dense gas fraction in the central disk regions. The spatially-resolved star formation main sequence and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations in our simulations are consistent with recent findings of the VERTICO and GASP surveys. Our results predict the environmental signals of RPS in future multiwavelength, high-angular resolution observations: the star formation and gas surface densities will be centralized, and symmetrically enhanced within the stripping radius.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
"Stable marriage problem under Monte Carlo simulations, influence of preferrence corelation on relaxation time","In this paper we consider stable marriage problem under the Monte Carlo simulations.

Collisional heating of icy planetesimals. I. Catastrophic collisions,"Planetesimals in the primordial disc may have experienced a collisional cascade. If so, the comet nuclei later placed in the Kuiper belt, scattered disc, and Oort Cloud would primarily be fragments and collisional rubble piles from that cascade. However, the heating associated with the collisions cannot have been strong enough to remove the hypervolatiles that are trapped within more durable ices, because comet nuclei are rich in hypervolatiles. This places constraints on the diameter of the largest bodies allowed to participate in collisional cascades, and limits the primordial disc lifetime or population size. In this paper, the thermophysical code NIMBUS is used to study the thermal evolution of planetesimals before, during, and after catastrophic collisions. The loss of CO during segregation of $\mathrm{CO_2:CO}$ mixtures and during crystallisation of amorphous $\mathrm{H_2O}$ is calculated, as well as mobilisation and internal relocation of $\mathrm{CO_2}$. If an amorphous $\mathrm{H_2O}$ host existed, and was protected by a $\mathrm{CO_2:CO}$ heat sink, only diameter $D<20\,\mathrm{km}$ (inner disc) and $D<64\,\mathrm{km}$ (outer disc) bodies could have been involved in a collisional cascade. If $\mathrm{CO_2}$ was the only CO host, the critical diameters drop to $D<20$-$32\mathrm{km}$. Avoiding disruption of larger bodies requires a primordial disc lifetime of $<9\,\mathrm{Myr}$ at $15\,\mathrm{au}$ and $<50$-$70\,\mathrm{Myr}$ at $30\,\mathrm{au}$. Alternatively, if a $450\,\mathrm{Myr}$ disc lifetime is required to associate the primordial disc disruption with the Late Heavy Bombardment, the disc population size must have been 6-60 times below current estimates.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,Discovering the most elusive radio relic in the sky: Diffuse Shock Acceleration caught in the act?,"The origin of radio relics is usually explained via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) or re-acceleration of electrons at/from merger shocks in galaxy clusters. The case of acceleration is challenged by the low predicted efficiency of low-Mach number merger shocks, unable to explain the power observed in most radio relics. In this Letter we present the discovery of a new giant radio relic around the galaxy cluster Abell 2249 ($z=0.0838$) using LOFAR. It is special since it has the lowest surface brightness of all known radio relics. We study its radio and X-ray properties combinig LOFAR data with uGMRT, JVLA and XMM. This object has a total power of $L_{1.4\rm GHz}=4.1\pm 0.8 \times 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and integrated spectral index $\alpha = 1.15\pm 0.23$. We infer for this radio relic a lower bound on the magnetisation of $B\geq 0.4\, \mu$G, a shock Mach number of $\mathcal{M}\approx 3.79$, and a low acceleration efficiency consistent with DSA. This result suggests that a missing population of relics may become visible thanks to the unprecedented sensitivity of the new generation of radio telescopes.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,0
Giant Dipole Resonance Parameters of Ground-State Photoabsorption: Experimental Values with Uncertainties,Updated values and corresponding uncertainties of Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) parameters which are obtained by the least-squares fitting of theoretical photoabsorption cross sections to experimental data are presented. The theoretical photoabsorption cross sections are taken as a sum of the components corresponding to the excitation of the GDR and quasideuteron photodisintegration.

Inclusion of the QvdW interactions leads to a qualitatively different behavior of susceptibilities, in many cases resembling lattice QCD simulations. It is shown that for some observables, in particular for $\chi_{11}^{BQ} / \chi_2^B$, effects of the QvdW interactions essentially cancel out. It is found that the inclusion of the finite resonance widths leads to an improved description of $\chi_2^B$, but it also leads to a worse description of $\chi_{11}^{BQ} / \chi_2^B$, as compared to the lattice data. On the other hand, inclusion of the extra, unconfirmed baryons into the hadron list leads to a simultaneous improvement in the description of both observables.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Novel Core-Shell Structures for Colloids made from Surfactants and Polymers,"We report on the formation of colloidal complexes resulting from the electrostatic self-assembly of polyelectrolyte-neutral block copolymers and oppositely charged surfactants. The copolymers investigated are asymmetric and characterized by a large neutral block. Using light, neutron and x-ray scattering experiments, we have shown that the colloidal complexes exhibit a core-shell microstructure. The core is described as a dense and disordered micro-phase of micelles connected by the polyelectrolyte blocks, whereas the shell is a diffuse brush made from the neutral chains. Colloidal complexes with core-shell structures resemble the well-known amphiphilic block copolymer micelles. The self-assembly mechanism is however different here. It is based on the complexation between opposite charges. This mechanism has recently attracted much interest because it allows to associate components of different nature, such as organic and inorganic or synthetic and biological.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Ground-state phase diagram of two-component interacting bosons on a two-leg ladder,"Using the cluster Gutzwiller mean-field method, we numerically study the ground-state phase diagram of the non-hard-core two-component interacting bosons trapped in a two-leg ladder with and without an artificial magnetic field. Interestingly, several loophole supercounterfluid (SCF) phases are observed at a sufficiently small intra- to inter-leg hopping ratio when the magnetic flux is absent. While if the ratio is not too small, the loophole SCF phases can be induced by the effect of the magnetic flux as well. Additionally, we also find that the presence of the magnetic flux leads to an enlargement of the Mott insulator lobe and the conventional SCF lobe. We hope these results can improve the understanding of the interplay between lattice gases, gauge fields, and bosonic ladder systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,0

Reconstruction of the unitary symmetry in super-relativity,"The reconstruction of the unitary symmetry \cite{TFD} under non-linear dynamical mapping Hilbert space of action amplitudes $C^N$ onto projective Hilbert space $CP(N-1)$ \cite{Le1} has been applied here to the quantum dynamics of elementary vacuum excitations.

Such procedure embeds the quantum dynamics into dynamical space-time whose state-dependent coordinates arose due to encoding results of quantum measurement by the qubit spinor whose components subjected to Lorentz transformations of ""quantum boosts"" and ""quantum rotations"".

Faculty members' categorizations were overall rated higher than those of students by three faculty members who evaluated all of the categorizations. The categories created by faculty members were more diverse compared to the categories they created for a set of introductory mechanics problems. Some faculty members noted that the categorization of introductory physics problems often involves identifying fundamental principles relevant for the problem, whereas in upper-level undergraduate quantum mechanics problems, it mainly involves identifying concepts and procedures required to solve the problem. Moreover, physics faculty members who evaluated others' categorizations expressed that the task was very challenging and they sometimes found another person's categorization to be better than their own.

We report here on one part of that study, a comparison of written responses by students with different physics backgrounds on a diffusion task administered in a senior biology capstone course. We observed differences in student reasoning that were associated with prior or concurrent enrollment in IPLS. In particular, we found that IPLS students were more likely than non-IPLS students to reason quantitatively and mechanistically about diffusive phenomena, and to successfully coordinate between multiple representations of diffusive processes, even up to two years after taking the IPLS course. Finally, we describe methodological challenges encountered in both this task and other tasks used in our longitudinal study.",physics,physics.ed-ph,0
Corrections to the ${\bf SU(3)\times SU(3)}$ Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation and chiral couplings $L^r_8$ and $H^r_2$,"Next to leading order corrections to the $SU(3) \times SU(3)$ Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation (GMOR) are obtained using weighted QCD Finite Energy Sum Rules (FESR) involving the pseudoscalar current correlator. Two types of integration kernels in the FESR are used to suppress the contribution of the kaon radial excitations to the hadronic spectral function, one with local and the other with global constraints. The result for the pseudoscalar current correlator at zero momentum is $\psi_5(0) = (2.8 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-3} GeV^{4}$, leading to the chiral corrections to GMOR: $\delta_K = (55 \pm 5)%$. The resulting uncertainties are mostly due to variations in the upper limit of integration in the FESR, within the stability regions, and to a much lesser extent due to the uncertainties in the strong coupling and the strange quark mass. Higher order quark mass corrections, vacuum condensates, and the hadronic resonance sector play a negligible role in this determination. These results confirm an independent determination from chiral perturbation theory giving also very large corrections, i.e. roughly an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding corrections in chiral $SU(2) \times SU(2)$. Combining these results with our previous determination of the corrections to GMOR in chiral $SU(2) \times SU(2)$, $\delta_\pi$, we are able to determine two low energy constants of chiral perturbation theory, i.e. $L^r_8 = (1.0 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-3}$, and $H^r_2 = - (4.7 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-3}$, both at the scale of the $\rho$-meson mass.",hep,hep-lat,Inverse seesaw and dark matter in a gauged ${\rm B-L}$ extension with flavour symmetry,"We propose a model which generates neutrino masses by the inverse seesaw mechanism, provides a viable dark matter candidate and explains the muon ($g-2$) anomaly. The Standard Model (SM) gauge group is extended with a gauged U(1)$_{\rm B-L}$ as well as a gauged U(1)$_{\rm L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$. While U(1)$_{\rm L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$ is anomaly free, the anomaly introduced by U(1)$_{\rm B-L}$ is cancelled between the six SM singlet fermions introduced for the inverse seesaw mechanism and four additional chiral fermions introduced in this model. After spontaneous symmetry breaking the four chiral fermionic degrees of freedom combine to give two Dirac states. The lightest Dirac fermion becomes stable and hence the dark matter candidate. We focus on the region of the parameter space where the dark matter annihilates to the right-handed neutrinos, relating the dark matter sector with the neutrino sector. The U(1)$_{\rm L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$ gauge symmetry provides a flavour structure to the inverse seesaw framework, successfully explaining the observed neutrino masses and mixings. We study the model parameters in the light of neutrino oscillation data and find correlation between them. Values of some of the model parameters are shown to be mutually exclusive between normal and inverted ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates.

The equation characterizing the boundary must satisfy a compatibility equation with the one characterizing the bulk that we called the three-dimensional (3D) boundary consistency. In comparison to the usual 3D consistency condition which is linked to a cube, our 3D boundary consistency condition lives on a half of a rhombic dodecahedron. The We provide a list of integrable boundaries associated to each quad-graph equation of the classification obtained by Adler, Bobenko and Suris. Then, the use of the term ""integrable boundary"" is justified by the facts that there are B\""acklund transformations and a zero curvature representation for systems with boundary satisfying our condition. We discuss the three-leg form of boundary equations, obtain associated discrete Toda-type models with boundary and recover previous results as particular cases. Finally, the connection between the 3D boundary consistency and the set-theoretical reflection equation is established.",nlin,nlin.SI,Preferential Partner Selection in an Evolutionary Study of Prisoner's Dilemma,"Partner selection is an important process in many social interactions, permitting individuals to decrease the risks associated with cooperation. In large populations, defectors may escape punishment by roving from partner to partner, but defectors in smaller populations risk social isolation. We investigate these possibilities for an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma in which agents use expected payoffs to choose and refuse partners. In comparison to random or round-robin partner matching, we find that the average payoffs attained with preferential partner selection tend to be more narrowly confined to a few isolated payoff regions. Most ecologies evolve to essentially full cooperative behavior, but when agents are intolerant of defections, or when the costs of refusal and social isolation are small, we also see the emergence of wallflower ecologies in which all agents are socially isolated. In between these two extremes, we see the emergence of ecologies whose agents tend to engage in a small number of defections followed by cooperation thereafter. The latter ecologies exhibit a plethora of interesting social interaction patterns.

Effect of dispersity of particle length on the electrical conductivity of the two-dimensional systems,"By means of computer simulation, we examined effect of dispersity of filler length on electrical conductivity of two-dimensional (2D) composites with rod-like fillers. Continuous approach has been used. Highly conductive zero-width rod-like particles were deposited uniformly with given anisotropy onto a poorly conductive substrate. Length of particles varied according to the lognormal distribution. Our simulation evidenced that slightly disordered systems may have both the high figure of merit, i.e., both high electrical conductivity and the optical transmission simultaneously, and the high electrical anisotropy.",physics,physics.class-ph,Semi-classical description of electrostatics and quantization of electric charge,"In this work, we present an explanation of the electric charge quantization based on a semi-classical model of electrostatic fields. We claim that in electrostatics, an electric charge must be equal to a rational multiple of the elementary charge of an electron. However, the charge is quantized if the system has certain boundary conditions that force the wavefunction representing an electric field to vanish at specific surfaces. Next, we develop the corresponding model for the electric displacement vector. It is demonstrated that a number of classical results, e.g. bending of field lines at the interface of two dielectric media, method of images, etc. are all consistent with the predictions of this model. We also present the possible form of Gauss's law or (Poisson's equation), to find the wavefunctions of the field from a source charge distribution, in this model.",physics,physics.gen-ph,0
Direct and Inverse Cascades in the Acceleration Region of the Fast Solar Wind,"Alfv\'{e}n waves are believed to play an important role in the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind emanating from coronal holes. Nonlinear interactions between the dominant ${\bf z}_{+}$ waves and minority ${\bf z}_{-}$ waves have the potential to transfer wave energy either to smaller perpendicular scales (""direct cascade"") or to larger scales (""inverse cascade""). In this paper we use reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations to investigate how the cascade rates $\epsilon_{\pm}$ depend on perpendicular wavenumber and radial distance from Sun center. For models with a smooth background atmosphere we find that an inverse cascade ($\epsilon_{+} < 0$) occurs for the dominant waves at radii between 1.4 and 2.5 $R_\odot$ and dimensionless wavenumbers in the inertial range ($15 < a_\perp < 44$), and a direct cascade ($\epsilon_{+} > 0$) occurs elsewhere. For a model with density fluctuations there are multiple regions with inverse cascade. In both cases the cascade rate $\epsilon_{+}$ varies significantly with perpendicular wavenumber, indicating that the cacsade is a highly non-local process. As a result of the inverse cascades, the enery dissipation rates are much lower than expected from a phenomenological model, and are insufficient to maintain the temperature of the background atmosphere. We conclude that RMHD models are unable to reproduce the observed properties of the fast solar wind.",physics,physics.space-ph,Novel Silicon n-on-p Edgeless Planar Pixel Sensors for the ATLAS upgrade,"In view of the LHC upgrade phases towards HL-LHC, the ATLAS experiment plans to upgrade the Inner Detector with an all-silicon system.

We report on the development of novel n-in-p edgeless planar pixel sensors fabricated at FBK (Trento, Italy), making use of the ""active edge"" concept for the reduction of the dead area at the periphery of the device.

Intrinsic current drive by electromagnetic electron drift wave turbulence in tokamak pedestal region,"The local intrinsic parallel current density driven by electron drift wave (DW) turbulence including electromagnetic (EM) effects is analytically studied. The scalings of the ratios of intrinsic current density driven by residual turbulent flux and by turbulent source to the bootstrap current density with electron density and temperature are predicted to be $T_e^{3/4}T_i/n_e$ and $T_eT_i/n_e$, respectively. Based on the typical parameters in DIII-D pedestal region, the local intrinsic current density driven by both the residual turbulent flux and the turbulent source is negligible. However, despite the negligible turbulent source driven current, the residual turbulent flux driven local intrinsic current density by EM DW turbulence can reach about 66% of the bootstrap current density for ITER pedestal parameters due to much lower collisionality in ITER than in DIII-D. Moreover, the contributions from adiabatic ES parts, non-adiabatic ES parts and non-adiabatic EM parts of the plasma response to electromagnetic fluctuations are analyzed. It is found that there exists strong cancelation between non-adiabatic ES response and the non-adiabatic EM response for the ITER pedestal case, and thus the kinetic stress contributed by the adiabatic ES response of parallel electron pressure dominates the intrinsic current drive. This is different from the ES electron DW case. Therefore, the EM effects on turbulence driven intrinsic current density should be carefully considered in the future reactor with high ratio of electron pressure to the magnetic pressure and steep pressure profile.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,"Geometry of River Networks I: Scaling, Fluctuations, and Deviations","This article is the first in a series of three papers investigating the detailed geometry of river networks. Large-scale river networks mark an important class of two-dimensional branching networks, being not only of intrinsic interest but also a pervasive natural phenomenon. In the description of river network structure, scaling laws are uniformly observed. Reported values of scaling exponents vary suggesting that no unique set of scaling exponents exists. To improve this current understanding of scaling in river networks and to provide a fuller description of branching network structure, we report here a theoretical and empirical study of fluctuations about and deviations from scaling. We examine data for continent-scale river networks such as the Mississippi and the Amazon and draw inspiration from a simple model of directed, random networks. We center our investigations on the scaling of the length of sub-basin's dominant stream with its area, a characterization of basin shape known as Hack's law. We generalize this relationship to a joint probability density and show that fluctuations about scaling are substantial. We find strong deviations from scaling at small scales which can be explained by the existence of linear network structure. At intermediate scales, we find slow drifts in exponent values indicating that scaling is only approximately obeyed and that universality remains indeterminate. At large scales, we observe a breakdown in scaling due to decreasing sample space and correlations with overall basin shape. The extent of approximate scaling is significantly restricted by these deviations and will not be improved by increases in network resolution.",physics,physics.geo-ph,0
On the Dynamical Foundation of Multifractality,"The crucial aspect of this demonstration is the discovery of renewal events, hidden in the computed dynamics of a multifractal metronome, which enables the replacement of the phenomenon of strong anticipation with a time delayed cross-correlation between the driven and the driving metronome. We establish that the phenomenon of complexity matching, which is the theme of an increasing number of research groups, has two distinct measures. One measure is the sensitivity of a complex system to environmental multi-fractality; another is the level of information transfer, between two complex networks at criticality. The cross-correlation function is evaluated in the ergodic long-time limit, but its delayed maximal value is the signature of information transfer occurring in the non ergodic short-time regime. It is shown that a more complex system transfers its multifractality to a less complex system while the reverse case is not possible.",nlin,nlin.AO,Complex dynamics in generalizations of the Chaplygin sleigh,"The article considers Chaplygin sleigh on a plane in potential well, assuming that an external potential force is supplied at the mass center. Two particular cases are studied in some detail, namely, a one-dimensional potential valley and a potential with rotational symmetry; in both cases the models reduce to four-dimensional differential equations conserving mechanical energy. Assuming the potential functions quadratic, various behaviors are observed numerically depending of the energy, from those characteristic to conservative dynamics (regularity islands and chaotic sea) to strange attractors. This is another example of nonholonomic system manifesting these phenomena (similar to those for Celtic stone or Chaplygin top), which reflects a fundamental nature of these systems occupying intermediate position between conservative and dissipative dynamics.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Dynamical properties of a particle in a wave packet: scaling invariance and boundary crisis,"Some dynamical properties present in a problem concerning the acceleration of particles in a wave packet are studied. The dynamics of the model is described in terms of a two-dimensional area preserving map. We show that the phase space is mixed in the sense that there are regular and chaotic regions coexisting. We use a connection with the standard map in order to find the position of the first invariant spanning curve which borders the chaotic sea. We find that the position of the first invariant spanning curve increases as a power of the control parameter with the exponent 2/3. The standard deviation of the kinetic energy of an ensemble of initial conditions obeys a power law as a function of time, and saturates after some crossover. Scaling formalism is used in order to characterize the chaotic region close to the transition from integrability to nonintegrability and a relationship between the power law exponents is derived. The formalism can be applied in many different systems with mixed phase space. Then, dissipation is introduced into the model and therefore the property of area preservation is broken, and consequently attractors are observed. We show that after a small change of the dissipation, the chaotic attractor as well as its basin of attraction are destroyed, thus leading the system to experience a boundary crisis. The transient after the crisis follows a power law with exponent -2.",nlin,nlin.CD,Intertwining operator for $AG_2$ Calogero-Moser-Sutherland system,We consider generalised Calogero-Moser-Sutherland quantum Hamiltonian $H$ associated with a configuration of vectors $AG_2$ on the plane which is a union of $A_2$ and $G_2$ root systems. The Hamiltonian $H$ depends on one parameter. We find an intertwining operator between $H$ and the Calogero-Moser-Sutherland Hamiltonian for the root system $G_2$. This gives a quantum integral for $H$ of order 6 in an explicit form thus establishing integrability of $H$.,nlin,nlin.SI,0
Real-space detection and manipulation of topological edge modes with ultracold atoms,"Conventional topological insulators exhibit exotic gapless edge or surface states, as a result of non-trivial bulk topological properties. In periodically-driven systems the bulk-boundary correspondence is fundamentally modified and knowledge about conventional bulk topological invariants is insufficient. While ultracold atoms provide excellent settings for clean realizations of Floquet protocols, the observation of real-space edge modes has so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate an experimental protocol for realizing chiral edge modes in optical lattices, by creating a topological interface using a potential step that is generated with a programmable optical potential. We show how to efficiently prepare particles in these edge modes in three distinct Floquet topological regimes that are realized in a periodically-driven honeycomb lattice. Controlling the height and sharpness of the potential step, we study how edge modes emerge at the interface and how the group velocity of the particles is modified as the sharpness of the potential step is varied.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Fragile antiferromagnetism in the heavy-fermion compound YbBiPt,"We report results from neutron scattering experiments on single crystals of YbBiPt that demonstrate antiferromagnetic order characterized by a propagation vector, $\tau_{\rm{AFM}}$ = ($\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{2}$), and ordered moments that align along the [1 1 1] direction of the cubic unit cell. We describe the scattering in terms of a two-Gaussian peak fit, which consists of a narrower component that appears below $T_{\rm{N}}~\approx 0.4$ K and corresponds to a magnetic correlation length of $\xi_{\rm{n}} \approx$ 80 $\rm{\AA}$, and a broad component that persists up to $T^*\approx$ 0.7 K and corresponds to antiferromagnetic correlations extending over $\xi_{\rm{b}} \approx$ 20 $\rm{\AA}$.

Multiphasic profiles for the biologically important ion activities of NaCl and KCl,"When plotted in linear transformations of the Michaelis-Menten equation, ion uptake in plants has been shown to be multiphasic, i.e. to be represented by a series of straight lines separated by discontinuous transitions (Nissen 1971, 1974, 1991, 1996). Reanalysis of data for other transport, binding and enzyme systems has also given such kinetics (Nissen and Mart\'in-Nieto 1998). Recently, such profiles have been found for a variety of biological as well as non-biological processes and phenomena, including activation of ion channels, binding, pH, folding/unfolding, effects of various interactions and chain length (Nissen 2015a,b, Nissen 2016a-d). These biological and nonbiological processes have little in common beyond the ions involved. Here I show that the multiphasic property seen in so many systems is present in the fundamental physical properties of the ion themselves. The characteristics of multiphasic profiles have now also been found in profiles for activities of ions in simple inorganic solutions, indicating that they are somehow causing the multiphasic profiles in more complex systems. A set of extensive and precise data (Lee et al. 2002) for the activities of the biologically very important ions Na+, K+ and Cl- (in NaCl and KCl) at four different temperatures (15, 25, 35 and 45oC) will be reanalyzed in the present paper. The activities of NaBr and KBr will be plotted in a forthcoming paper. Extensive data for these and other ion activities Wilczek-Vera et al.

The investigation is performed by employing a comprehensive thermal-electrical modeling approach which takes into account all the major processes affected by the temperature variation in the photovoltaic devices. We show that effectively reflecting the ultraviolet radiation (i.e. up to a certain wavelength) results in a reduction of the overall operation temperature and enhancement of the PV cell's efficiency. In addition, blocking the high energy ultraviolet photons prolongs the life time of the PV and its performance on the long term.",physics,physics.app-ph,0
Combining initial-state resummation with fixed-order calculations of electroweak corrections,"We present a resummation of those double-logarithmically enhanced electroweak correction that arise in pp colliders because protons are not SU(2) singlets, by solving DGLAP equations in the full Standard Model. We then show how to match these results with those of fixed-order electroweak calculations.

These theorems demonstrate the breakdown of the theory at certain `base points' of the Cauchy horizon, which are defined as `past terminal accumulation points' of the horizon generators. Thus, the theorems may be interpreted as giving support to Hawking's `Chronology Protection Conjecture', according to which the laws of physics prevent one from manufacturing a `time machine'. Specifically, we prove: Theorem 1: There is no extension to (M,g_{ab}) of the usual field algebra on the initial globally hyperbolic region which satisfies the condition of F-locality at any base point. In other words, any extension of the field algebra must, in any globally hyperbolic neighbourhood of any base point, differ from the algebra one would define on that neighbourhood according to the rules for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Theorem 2: The two-point distribution for any Hadamard state defined on the initial globally hyperbolic region must (when extended to a distributional bisolution of the covariant Klein-Gordon equation on the full spacetime) be singular at every base point x in the sense that the difference between this two point distribution and a local Hadamard distribution cannot be given by a bounded function in any neighbourhood (in MXM) of (x,x). Theorem 2 implies quantities such as the renormalized expectation value of \phi^2 or of the stress-energy tensor are necessarily ill-defined or singular at any base point. The proofs rely on the `Propagation of Singularities' theorems of Duistermaat and H\""ormander.",hep,hep-th,0
Probing magnetars magnetosphere through X-ray polarization measurements,"The study of magnetars is of particular relevance since these objects are the only laboratories where the physics in ultra-strong magnetic fields can be directly tested. Until now, spectroscopic and timing measurements at X-ray energies in soft gamma-repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXPs) have been the main source of information about the physical properties of a magnetar and of its magnetosphere. Spectral fitting in the ~ 0.5-10 keV range allowed to validate the ""twisted magnetosphere"" model, probing the structure of the external field and estimating the density and velocity of the magnetospheric currents. Spectroscopy alone, however, may fail in disambiguating the two key parameters governing magnetospheric scattering (the charge velocity and the twist angle) and is quite insensitive to the source geometry. X-ray polarimetry, on the other hand, can provide a quantum leap in the field by adding two extra observables, the linear polarization degree and the polarization angle. Using the bright AXP 1RXS J170849.0-400910 as a template, we show that phase-resolved polarimetric measurements can unambiguously determine the model parameters, even with a small X-ray polarimetry mission carrying modern photoelectric detectors and existing X-ray optics. We also show that polarimetric measurements can pinpoint vacuum polarization effects and thus provide an indirect evidence for ultra-strong magnetic fields.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Particle-Particle Particle-Tree: A Direct-Tree Hybrid Scheme for Collisional N-Body Simulations,"In this paper, we present a new hybrid algorithm for the time integration of collisional N-body systems. In this algorithm, gravitational force between two particles is divided into short-range and long-range terms, using a distance-dependent cutoff function. The long-range interaction is calculated using the tree algorithm and integrated with the constant-timestep leapfrog integrator. The short-range term is calculated directly and integrated with the high-order Hermite scheme. We can reduce the calculation cost per orbital period from O(N^2) to O(N log N), without significantly increasing the long-term integration error. The results of our test simulations show that close encounters are integrated accurately. Long-term errors of the total energy shows random-walk behaviour, because it is dominated by the error caused by tree approximation.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,0
On the origin of elemental abundances in the terrestrial planets,"The abundances of elements in the Earth and the terrestrial planets provide the initial conditions for life and clues as to the history and formation of the Solar System. We follow the pioneering work of Bond et al. (2010) and combine circumstellar disk models, chemical equilibrium calculations and dynamical simulations of planet formation to study the bulk composition of rocky planets. We use condensation sequence calculations to estimate the initial abundance of solids in the circumstellar disk with properties determined from time dependent theoretical models. We combine this with dynamical simulations of planetesimal growth that trace the solids during the planet formation process. We calculate the elemental abundances in the resulting planets and explore how these vary with the choice of disk model and the initial conditions within the Solar Nebula. Although certain characteristics of the terrestrial planets in the Solar System could be reproduced, none of our models could reproduce the abundance properties of all the planets. We found that the choice of the initial planetesimal disk mass and of the disk model has a significant effect on composition gradients. Disk models that give higher pressure and temperature result in larger variations in the bulk chemical compositions of the resulting planets due to inhomogeneities in the element abundance profiles and due to the different source regions of the planets in the dynamical simulations. We observed a trend that massive planets and planets with relatively small semi-major axes are more sensitive to these variations than smaller planets at larger radial distance. Only these large variations in the simulated chemical abundances can potentially explain the diverse bulk composition of the Solar System planets, whereas Mercury's bulk composition can not be reproduced in our approach.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,Deep Radio Interferometric Imaging with POLISH: DSA-2000 and weak lensing,"Radio interferometry allows astronomers to probe small spatial scales that are often inaccessible with single-dish instruments. However, recovering the radio sky from an interferometer is an ill-posed deconvolution problem that astronomers have worked on for half a century. More challenging still is achieving resolution below the array's diffraction limit, known as super-resolution imaging. To this end, we have developed a new learning-based approach for radio interferometric imaging, leveraging recent advances in the classical computer vision problems of single-image super-resolution (SISR) and deconvolution. We have developed and trained a high dynamic range residual neural network to learn the mapping between the dirty image and the true radio sky. We call this procedure POLISH, in contrast to the traditional CLEAN algorithm. The feed forward nature of learning-based approaches like POLISH is critical for analyzing data from the upcoming Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-2000). We show that POLISH achieves super-resolution, and we demonstrate its ability to deconvolve real observations from the Very Large Array (VLA). Super-resolution on DSA-2000 will allow us to measure the shapes and orientations of several hundred million star forming radio galaxies (SFGs), making it a powerful cosmological weak lensing survey and probe of dark energy.

Parameter estimation in nonlinear stochastic differential equations,"We discuss the problem of parameter estimation in nonlinear stochastic differential equations based on sampled time series. A central message from the theory of integrating stochastic differential equations is that there exists in general two time scales, i.e. that of integrating these equations and that of sampling.

The effective interaction potential, which takes into account the screening effects at large distances and quantum diffraction effects at short distances, was used.

It is peculiar for the geometry of AO interaction of the shear acoustic wave propagating in the YZ plane (the velocity 3994 m/s) with the optical wave polarized in the same plane.

The dynamics of the system is first studied in the presence of both forces separately without noise. In the presence of only one of the forces, no resonance behaviour is observed, however, hysteresis happens there. Then the influence of the high-frequency force in the presence of a low-frequency, i.e. biharmonic forcing, is studied. Vibrational resonance is found to occur when the amplitude of the high-frequency force is varied. The resonance curve resembles a stochastic resonance-like curve. It is maximum at the value of $g$ at which the orbit lies in one well during one half of the drive cycle of the low-frequency force and in the other for the remaining half cycle. Vibrational resonance is characterized using the response amplitude and mean residence time. We show the occurrence of stochastic resonance behaviour in the overdamped system by replacing the high-frequency force by Gaussian noise.

Each system exhibits both thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies, a density maximum and the translational and rotational mobilities show anomalous behavior. Starting with very dense systems and decreasing the density, both mobilities first increase, reache a maximum, then decrease, reache a minimum, and finally increase; this behavior is similar to the behavior of SPC/E water.

We compute the azimuthal asymmetry which is due to multiple interactions of partons at the initial stage of nuclear collisions, and which is also present in $pA$ collisions. In our approach the main source of azimuthal asymmetry is the combination of parton multiple interactions with the steep variation of the nuclear density at the edge of nuclei.

Topography of the hot sphaleron Transitions,"By numerical simulations in {\it real time} we provide evidence in favour of sphaleron like transitions in the hot, symmetric phase of the electroweak theory. Earlier performed observations of a change in the Chern-Simons number are supplemented with a measurement of the lowest eigenvalues of the three-dimensional staggered fermion Dirac operator and observations of the spatial extension of energy lumps associated with the transition. The observations corroborate on the interpretation of the change in Chern-Simons numbers as representing continuum physics, not lattice artifacts. By combining the various observations it is possible to follow in considerable detail the time-history of thermal fluctuations of the classical gauge-field configurations responsible for the change in the Chern-Simons number.",hep,hep-lat,Search for a Low Mass Standard Model Higgs Boson at D0 in ppbar Collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV$,"We present combined searches for the Low Mass Standard Model Higgs boson at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=$1.96 TeV, using up to 5 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider.

Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses $10^{3-5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are potential seeds for these observed SMBHs. A possible formation channel of these SMSs is the interplay of gas accretion and runaway stellar collisions inside dense nuclear star clusters (NSCs). However, mass loss due to stellar winds could be an important limitation for the formation of the SMSs and affect the final mass. In this paper, we study the effect of mass loss driven by stellar winds on the formation and evolution of SMSs in dense NSCs using idealised N-body simulations. Considering different accretion scenarios, we have studied the effect of the mass loss rates over a wide range of metallicities $Z_\ast=[.001-1]\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$ and Eddington factors $f_{\rm Edd}=L_\ast/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}=0.5,0.7,\,\&\, 0.9$. For a high accretion rate of $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$, SMSs with masses $\gtrsim 10^3\MSun$ could be formed even in a high metallicity environment. For a lower accretion rate of $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$, SMSs of masses $\sim 10^{3-4}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed for all adopted values of $Z_\ast$ and $f_{\rm Edd}$, except for $Z_\ast=\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$ and $f_{\rm Edd}=0.7$ or 0.9. For Eddington accretion, SMSs of masses $\sim 10^3\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed in low metallicity environments with $Z_\ast\lesssim 0.01\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$. The most massive SMSs of masses $\sim 10^5\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed for Bondi-Hoyle accretion in environments with $Z_\ast \lesssim 0.5\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
The Effect of Ionic Spin on Multiferroic of Orthorhombic Perovskite,"To investigate the influence of ion spin on the coupling between ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in type II multiferroic perovskite, we prepared the multiferroic perovskite Er0.9La0.1Cr0.8Fe0.2O3 (ELCFO) using the sol-gel method, and explored the macroscopic magnetic properties of ELCFO through M\""ossbauer spectrum and magnetic testing. The thermal magnetic curve was analyzed to examine the state and change of each ionic spin in the ELCFO system at different temperature ranges, and the role of ionic spin in the coupling between ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity was investigated.

In $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ charge order emerges in two steps: a 2D order found at zero field and at high temperature inside the pseudogap phase, and a 3D order that is superimposed below the superconducting transition $T_c$ when superconductivity is weakened by a magnetic field. Several issues still need to be addressed such as the effect of disorder, the relationship between those charge orders and their respective impact on the Fermi surface. Here, we report high magnetic field sound velocity measurements of the 3D charge order in underdoped $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ in a large doping range. We found that the 3D charge order exists over the same doping range as its 2D counterpart, indicating an intimate connection between the two distinct orders. Moreover, we argue that the Fermi surface is reconstructed above the onset temperature of 3D charge order.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,0
Operation of the jet feedback mechanism (JFM) in intermediate luminosity optical transients (ILOTs),"We follow the premise that most intermediate luminosity optical transients (ILOTs) are powered by rapid mass accretion onto a main sequence star, and study the effects of jets launched by an accretion disk. The disk is formed due to large specific angular momentum of the accreted mass. The two opposite jets might expel some of the mass from the reservoir of gas that feeds the disk, and therefore reduces and shortens the mass accretion process. We argue that by this process ILOTs limit their luminosity and might even shut themselves off in this negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). The group of ILOTs is a new member of a large family of astrophysical objects whose activity is regulated by the operation of the JFM.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,A Stringy Mechanism for A Small Cosmological Constant - Multi-Moduli Cases -,"Based on the properties of probability distributions of functions of random variables, we proposed earlier a simple stringy mechanism that prefers the meta-stable vacua with a small cosmological constant \Lambda. As an illustration of this approach, we study in this paper particularly simple but non-trivial models of the K\""ahler uplift in the large volume flux compactification scenario in Type IIB string theory, where all parameters introduced in the model are treated either as fixed constants motivated by physics, or as random variables with some given uniform probability distributions. We determine the value w_0 of the superpotential W_0 at the supersymmetric minima, and find that the resulting probability distribution P(w_0) peaks at w_0=0; furthermore, this peaking behavior strengthens as the number of complex structure moduli increases. The resulting probability distribution P(\Lambda) for meta-stable vacua also peaks as \Lambda -> 0, for both positive and negative \Lambda. This peaking/divergent behavior of P(\Lambda) strengthens as the number of moduli increases. In some scenarios for \Lambda > 0, the likely value of \Lambda decreases exponentially as the number of moduli increases. The light cosmological moduli issue accompanying a very small \Lambda is also mentioned.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,0
"Dark energy, chaotic fields, and fundamental constants","To explain the currently observed accelerated expansion of the universe, a large number of different theoretical models are presently being discussed. In one way or another, all of these contain `new physics', though at different levels. The big question is how to select out of infinitely many possible models the right one. Here we discuss a possibility that has so far been somewhat neglected, namely that the new physics underlying dark energy arises out of a gravitationally active amendment of the electroweak and strong sector of the standard model. This amendment basically consists of a rapidly fluctuating gravitationally active dynamics of vacuum fluctuations with a cutoff of the order of the neutrino mass scale. We consider a concrete model for this based on second-quantized self-interacting scalar fields, which evolve in a chaotic way. It is shown that expectations with respect to the chaotic dynamics yield statements on the observed numerical values of the electroweak coupling constants with amazing precision, thus providing evidence for the physical relevance of this model.",hep,hep-ph,$\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ Physics at BES-III,"Decays of both $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ provide very useful information in our understanding of low-energy QCD, and experimental signatures for these decays would be extremely helpful at BES-III.

The Carnegie Supernova Project II. The shock wave revealed through the fog: The strongly interacting Type IIn SN 2013L,"We present ultra-violet to mid-infrared observations of the long-lasting Type IIn supernova (SN) 2013L obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project II (CSP-II). The spectra of SN 2013L are dominated by H emission features characterized by three components attributed to different regions. A unique feature of this Type IIn SN is that the blue shifted line profile is dominated by the macroscopic velocity of the expanding shock wave of the SN. We are therefore able to trace the evolution of the shock velocity in the dense and partially opaque circumstellar medium (CSM), from $\sim 4800~km~s^{-1}$ at +48 d, decreasing as $t^{-0.23}$ to $\sim 2700~km~s^{-1}$ after a year. We perform spectral modeling of both the broad- and intermediate-velocity components of the H$\alpha$ line profile. The high-velocity component is consistent with emission from a radially thin, spherical shell located behind the expanding shock with emission wings broadened by electron scattering. We propose that the intermediate component originates from pre-ionized gas from the unshocked dense CSM with the same velocity as the narrow component, $\sim 100~km~s^{-1}$, but also broadened by electron scattering. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SN 2013L after +132 d are well reproduced by a two-component black-body (BB) model. The circumstellar-interaction model of the bolometric light curve reveals a mass-loss rate history with large values ($1.7\times 10^{-2} - 0.15~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$) over the $\sim $25 - 40 years before explosion. The drop in the light curve at $\sim 350$ days and presence of electron scattering wings at late epochs indicate an anisotropic CSM. The mass-loss rate values and the unshocked CSM velocity are consistent with the characteristics of a massive star, such as a luminous blue variable (LBV) undergoing strong eruptions, similar to $\eta$ Carina.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Is the M81 Fast Radio Burst Host Globular Cluster Special?,"We use multiband archival HST observations to measure the photometric and structural parameters of the M81 globular cluster that hosts the Fast Radio Burst FRB 20200120E. Our best-fitting King model has an effective radius $r_h = 3.06$ pc with a moderate King model concentration of $c = 53$, and an inferred core radius of 0.81 pc. We revisit the exact astrometric location of the FRB within the cluster, and find that FRB 20200120E is located 1.92 pc from the center, but within the projected half-light radius. We estimate the relative encounter rate of the FRB host, along with the corresponding rates of 210 other globular clusters in M81, and compare these values with the encounter rates of Galactic globular clusters. The FRB resides in a globular cluster with an encounter rate that is moderately higher than the median stellar encounter rate in our two comparison samples. While the estimated encounter rate of the FRB host cluster (e.g., $\sim50\%$ of a cluster like 47 Tuc) is sufficient to allow the possibility that the FRB formed dynamically, our results do not place strong constraints on this scenario due to the limitations of the available HST data and the possible systematic uncertainties and selection effects in the comparison data.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0

We exploit the symmetries of the problem, in particular the Hamiltonian structure and the $\U(1)$ symmetry. We develop a simple sufficient criterion that guarantees the existence of a modulational instability spectrum along the imaginary axis. In the case of small amplitude solutions that bifurcate from the band edges of the linear problem this criterion becomes especially simple. We find that the small amplitude solutions corresponding to the band edges alternate stability, with the first band edge being modulationally unstable in the focusing case, the second band edge being modulationally unstable in the defocusing case, and so on. This small amplitude result has a nice physical interpretation in terms of the effective mass of a particle in the periodic potential. We also consider, in somewhat less detail, some sideband instabilities in the small amplitude limit. We find that, depending on the Krein signature of the collision, these can be of one of two types. Finally we illustrate this with some exact calculations in the case where $V(x)$ is an elliptic function, where all of the relevant calculations can be done explicitly.",nlin,nlin.PS,0

Designing Disordered Hyperuniform Two-Phase Materials with Novel Physical Properties,"Heterogeneous materials consisting of different phases are ideally suited to achieve a broad spectrum of desirable bulk physical properties by combining the best features of the constituents through the strategic spatial arrangement of the different phases. Disordered hyperuniform heterogeneous materials are new, exotic amorphous matter that behave like crystals in the manner in which they suppress volume-fraction fluctuations at large length scales, and yet are isotropic with no Bragg peaks. In this paper, we formulate for the first time a Fourier-space numerical construction procedure to design at will a wide class of disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with prescribed spectral densities, which enables one to tune the degree and length scales at which this suppression occurs. We demonstrate that the anomalous suppression of volume-fraction fluctuations in such two-phase materials endow them with novel and often optimal transport and electromagnetic properties. Specifically, we construct a family of phase-inversion-symmetric materials with variable topological connectedness properties that remarkably achieves a well-known explicit formula for the effective electrical (thermal) conductivity. Moreover, we design disordered stealthy hyperuniform dispersion that possesses nearly optimal effective conductivity while being statistically isotropic. Interestingly, all of our designed materials are transparent to electromagnetic radiation for certain wavelengths, which is a common attribute of all hyperuniform materials. Our constructed materials can be readily realized by 3D printing and lithographic technologies. We expect that our designs will be potentially useful for energy-saving materials, batteries and aerospace applications.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Correlation Time for Step Structural Fluctuations,"Time dependent STM has been used to evaluate step fluctuations as a function of temperature (300-450 K) on Ag(111) films grown on mica. The temporal correlation function scales as a power law in time, t^1/n with measured values of 1/n varying over a range of 0.19 pm 0.04 to 0.29 pm 0.04 with no dependence on temperature. The average value of 1/n = 0.24 pm 0.01 is consistent with step-edge diffusion limited fluctuations (n = z = 4, conserved noise). The magnitude of the time correlation function and the width of the fluctuations both scale with temperature with the same apparent activation energy of Eeff = 0.21 pm 0.02 eV, indicating that the correlation time is at most weakly temperature dependent. Direct analysis of the autocorrelation function confirms that the correlation time is at most weakly temperature dependent, and thus the apparent correlation length is strongly temperature dependent. This behavior can be reproduced by assuming that the apparent correlation length is governed by the longest wavelength of step fluctuations that can be sampled in the measurement time interval. Evaluation of the correlation time for previous measurements for Al/Si(111) (z =2) yields the same conclusion about measurement time interval. In both cases the ratio of the measurement time to the effective correlation time is on the order of 10.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,0
The EOS of neutron matter and the effect of $\Lambda$ hyperons to neutron star structure,"The structure of neutron stars is determined by the equation of state of the matter inside the star, which relies on the knowledge of nuclear interactions. While radii of neutron stars mostly depend on the equation of state of neutron matter at nuclear densities, their maximum mass can be drastically affected by the appearance of hyperons at higher densities in the inner core of the star. We summarize recent quantum Monte Carlo results on the calculation of the equation of state of neutron matter at nuclear and higher densities.

Jet azimuthal angle correlations in the production of a Higgs boson pair plus two jets at hadron colliders,"Azimuthal angle correlations of two jets in the process $pp\to HHjj$ are studied. The loop induced $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^4 \alpha_{}^2)$ gluon fusion (GF) sub-process and the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{}^4)$ weak boson fusion (WBF) sub-process are considered. The GF sub-process exhibits strong correlations in the azimuthal angles $\phi_{1,2}^{}$ of the two jets measured from the production plane of the Higgs boson pair and the difference between these two angles $\phi_1^{}-\phi_2^{}$, and a very small correlation in the sum of them $\phi_1^{}+\phi_2^{}$. The impact of using a finite top mass $m_t^{}$ value on the correlations is found crucial. The transverse momentum of the Higgs boson can be used to enhance or suppress the correlations. The impact of a non-standard value for the triple Higgs self-coupling on the correlations is found much smaller than that on other observables, such as the invariant mass of the two Higgs bosons. The peak shifts of the azimuthal angle distributions reflect the magnitude of parity violation in the $gg\to HH$ amplitude and the dependence of the distributions on parity violating phases is analytically clarified. The WBF sub-process also produces correlated distributions and it is found that they are not induced by the quantum effect of the intermediate weak bosons but mainly by a kinematic effect. This kinematic effect is a characteristic feature of the WBF sub-process and is not observed in the GF sub-process. It is found that the correlations are different in the GF and in the WBF sub-processes. As part of the process dependent information, they will be helpful in the analyses of both the GF sub-process and the WBF sub-process at the LHC.",hep,hep-ex,Inertial and gravitational effects on a geonium atom,"We reveal all linear order inertial and gravitational effects on a non-relativistic Dirac particle (mass $m$) on the Earth up to the order of $1/m$ in the Foldy-Wouthuysen-like expansion.

It is shown that each correction from gravity has different dependence on the cyclotron frequency and the mass $m$. Therefore, their magnitude change depending on situations. In a particular case of an electron $g$-factor measurement, the dominant correction to the observed $g$-factor comes from effects of the Earth's rotation, which is $\delta g / 2 \simeq 5.2 \times 10^{-17}$.

Light bullets in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic topological insulators,"We introduce a different class of thresholdless three-dimensional soliton states that form in higher-order topological insulators based on a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger array of coupled waveguides. The linear spectrum of such structures is characterized by the presence of a topological gap with corner states residing in them. We find that a focusing Kerr nonlinearity allows families of light bullets bifurcating from the linear corner states to exist as stable three-dimensional solitons, which inherit topological protection from their linear corner counterparts and, remarkably, survive even in the presence of considerable disorder. The light bullets exhibit a spatial localization degree that depends strongly on the array dimerization and may feature large temporal widths in the topological gap near the bifurcation point, thus drastically reducing the otherwise strong instabilities caused by higher-order effects.",nlin,nlin.PS,Failure mechanisms of load sharing complex systems,"We investigate the failure mechanisms of load sharing complex systems.

The failure mechanisms of these two models demonstrate temporal scaling phenomena, phase transitions and multiple distinct failure modes excited by extremal dynamics. For critical ranges of parameters the models demonstrate power law and exponential failure patterns.

Magnetoelastic Effects in Iron Telluride,"Iron telluride doped lightly with selenium is known to undergo a first order magneto-structural transition before turning superconducting at higher doping. We study the effects of magneto-elastic couplings on this transition using symmetry considerations. We find that the magnetic order parameters are coupled to the uniform monoclinic strain of the unit cell with one iron per cell, as well as to the phonons at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. In the magnetic phase the former gives rise to monoclinic distortion while the latter induces dimerization of the ferromagnetic iron chains due to alternate lengthening and shortening of the nearest-neighbour iron-iron bonds. We compare this system with the iron arsenides and propose a microscopic magneto-elastic Hamiltonian which is relevant for all the iron based superconductors.

For jellium slabs, we prove analytically and numerically that in the vacuum region far away from the surface $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{Slab}}(z \to \infty) \to - e^{2}/2z$, {\it independent} of the bulk electron density, which is exactly half the corresponding exact-exchange potential $V_{x}(z \to \infty) \to - e^2/z$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 97}, 026802 (2006)] of density-functional theory, as occurs in the case of finite systems. The fitting of $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{Slab}}(z)$ to a physically motivated image-like expression is feasible, but the resulting location of the image plane shows strong finite-size oscillations every time a slab discrete energy level becomes occupied. For a semi-infinite jellium, the asymptotic behavior of $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{SI}}(z)$ is somehow different. As in the case of jellium slabs $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{SI}}(z \to \infty)$ has an image-like behavior of the form $\propto - e^2/z$, but now with a density-dependent coefficient that in general differs from the slab universal coefficient 1/2. Our numerical estimates for this coefficient agree with two previous analytical estimates for the same. For an arbitrary finite thickness of a jellium slab, we find that the asymptotic limits of $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{Slab}}(z)$ and $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{SI}}(z)$ only coincide in the low-density limit ($r_s \to \infty$), where the density-dependent coefficient of the semi-infinite jellium approaches the slab {\it universal} coefficient 1/2.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,0
Resonance in modulation instability from non-instantaneous nonlinearities,"To explore resonance phenomena in the nonlinear region, we show by experimental measurements and theoretical analyses that resonance happens in modulation instability (MI) from non-instantaneous nonlinearities in photorefractive crystals. With a temporally periodic modulation in the external bias voltage, corresponding to a modulation in the nonlinear strength, an enhancement in the visibility of MI at resonant frequency is reported through spontaneous optical pattern formations. Modeled by such temporally periodic nonlinear driving force to the system, theoretical curves obtained from a nonlinear non-instantaneous Schr\""{o}dinger equation give good agreement to experimental data.

Strong thermal transport along polycrystalline transition metal dichalcogenides revealed by multiscale modelling for MoS2,"Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent a large family of high-quality 2D materials with attractive electronic, thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique is currently the most reliable route to synthesis few-atomic layer thick and large-scale TMDs films. However, the effects of grain boundaries formed during the CVD method on the properties of TMDs nanomembranes have remained less explored. In this study, we therefore aim to investigate the thermal conduction along polycrystalline molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as the representative member of TMDs nanomembranes family. This goal was achieved by developing a combined atomistic-continuum multiscale method. In the proposed approach, reactive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to assess thermal contact conductance of diverse grain boundaries with various defects configurations. The effective thermal conductivity along the CVD grown polycrystalline and single-layer MoS2 was finally acquired by conducting finite element modelling.

The main purpose is to map the radial variation of the stellar space density for the young stellar population in the Galactic anticenter direction in order to understand the structure and location of the Perseus spiral arm. Methods. A uvbyHbeta Stromgren photometric survey covering 16sqrdeg in the anticenter direction was carried out using the Wide Field Camera at the Isaac Newton Telescope. This is the natural photometric system for identifying young stars and obtaining accurate estimates of individual distances and ages. The calibration to the standard system was undertaken using open clusters. Results. We present a main catalog of 35974 stars with all Stromgren indexes and a more extended one with 96980 stars with partial data. The central 8sqrdeg have a limiting magnitude of V<17m, while the outer region reaches V<15.5m. These large samples will permit us to analyze the stellar surface density variation associated to the Perseus arm also to study the properties of the stellar component and the interstellar extinction in the anticenter direction.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Development of a cosmic ray oriented trigger for the fluorescence telescope on EUSO-SPB2,"The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2), in preparation, aims to make the first observations of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) from near space using optical techniques. EUSO-SPB2 will prototype instrumentation for future satellite-based missions, including the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) and K-EUSO. The payload will consist of two telescopes. The first is a Cherenkov telescope (CT) being developed to quantify the background for future below-the-limb very high energy (E>10 PeV) astrophysical neutrino observations, and the second is a fluorescence telescope (FT) being developed for detection of UHECRs. The FT will consist of a Schmidt telescope, and a 6192 pixel ultraviolet camera with an integration time of 1.05 microseconds. The first step in the data acquisition process for the FT is a hardware level trigger in order to decide which data to record. In order to maximize the number of UHECR induced extensive air showers (EASs) which can be detected, a novel trigger algorithm has been developed based on the intricacies and limitations of the detector. The expected performance of the trigger has been characterized by simulations and, pending hardware verification, shows that EUSO-SPB2 is well positioned to attempt the first near-space observation of UHECRs via optical techniques.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,0
"Gamow-Teller strength for the analog transitions to the first T=1/2, J^pi=3/2- states in 13C and 13N and the implications for Type Ia supernovae","The Gamow-Teller strength for the transition from the ground state of 13C to the T=1/2, J^pi=3/2- excited state at 3.51 MeV in 13N is extracted via the 13C(3He,t) reaction at 420 MeV. In contrast to results from earlier (p,n) studies on 13C, a good agreement with shell-model calculations and the empirical unit cross section systematics from other nuclei is found. The results are used to study the analog 13N(e-,v_e)13C reaction, which plays a role in the pre-explosion convective phase of type Ia supernovae. Although the differences between the results from the (3He,t) and (p,n) data significantly affect the deduced electron-capture rate and the net heat-deposition in the star due to this transition, the overall effect on the pre-explosive evolution is small.",nucl,nucl-ex,Phi-Phi Back-to-Back Correlations in Finite Expanding Systems,"Back-to-Back Correlations (BBC) of particle-antiparticle pairs are predicted to appear if hot and dense hadronic matter is formed in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. The BBC are related to in-medium mass-modification and squeezing of the quanta involved. Although the suppression of finite emission times were already known, the effects of finite system sizes and of collective phenomena had not been studied yet. Thus, for testing the survival and magnitude of the effect in more realistic situations, we study the BBC when mass-modification occurs in a finite sized, thermalized medium, considering a non-relativistically expanding fireball with finite emission time, and evaluating the width of the back-to-back correlation function. We show that the BBC signal indeed survives the expansion and flow effects, with sufficient magnitude to be observed at RHIC.",nucl,nucl-th,0

Detecting planetary mass companions near the water frost-line using JWST interferometry,"JWST promises to be the most versatile infrared observatory for the next two decades. The Near Infrared and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument, when used in the Aperture Masking Interferometry (AMI) mode, will provide an unparalleled combination of angular resolution and sensitivity compared to any existing observatory at mid-infrared wavelengths. Using simulated observations in conjunction with evolutionary models, we present the capability of this mode to image planetary mass companions around nearby stars at small orbital separations near the circumstellar water frost-line for members of the young, kinematic moving groups Beta Pictoris, TW Hydrae, as well as the Taurus-Auriga association. We show that for appropriately chosen stars, JWST/NIRISS operating in the AMI mode can image sub-Jupiter companions near the water frost-lines with ~68% confidence. Among these, M-type stars are the most promising. We also show that this JWST mode will improve the minimum inner working angle by as much as ~50% in most cases when compared to the survey results from the best ground-based exoplanet direct imaging facilities (e.g. VLT/SPHERE). We also discuss how the NIRISS/AMI mode will be especially powerful for the mid-infrared characterization of the numerous exoplanets expected to be revealed by Gaia. When combined with dynamical masses from Gaia, such measurements will provide a much more robust characterization of the initial entropies of these young planets, thereby placing powerful constraints on their early thermal histories.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,Priority Questions for Jupiter System Science in the 2020s and Opportunities for Europa Clipper,"This whitepaper identifies important science questions that can be answered through exploration of the Jupiter System, with emphasis on the questions that can be addressed by the Europa Clipper Mission.

Two-dimensional solitons at interfaces between binary superlattices and homogeneous lattices,"We report on the experimental observation of two-dimensional surface solitons residing at the interface between a homogeneous square lattice and a superlattice that consists of alternating ""deep"" and ""shallow"" waveguides. By exciting single waveguides in the first row of the superlattice, we show that solitons centered on deep sites require much lower powers than their respective counterparts centered on shallow sites.

Order 1 autoregressive process of finite length,"The stochastic processes of finite length defined by recurrence relations request additional relations specifying the first terms of the process analogously to the initial conditions for the differential equations. As a general rule, in time series theory one analyzes only stochastic processes of infinite length which need no such initial conditions and their properties are less difficult to be determined. In this paper we compare the properties of the order 1 autoregressive processes of finite and infinite length and we prove that the time series length has an important influence mainly if the serial correlation is significant. These different properties can manifest themselves as transient effects produced when a time series is numerically generated. We show that for an order 1 autoregressive process the transient behavior can be avoided if the first term is a Gaussian random variable with standard deviation equal to that of the theoretical infinite process and not to that of the white noise innovation.",physics,physics.data-an,Fourier-Hermite spectral representation for the Vlasov-Poisson system in the weakly collisional limit,"We study Landau damping in the 1+1D Vlasov-Poisson system using a Fourier-Hermite spectral representation. We describe the propagation of free energy in phase space using forwards and backwards propagating Hermite modes recently developed for gyrokinetics [Schekochihin et al. (2014)]. The change in the electric field corresponds to the net Hermite flux via a free energy evolution equation. In linear Landau damping, decay in the electric field corresponds to forward propagating Hermite modes; in nonlinear damping, the initial decay is followed by a growth phase characterised by the generation of backwards propagating Hermite modes by the nonlinear term. The free energy content of the backwards propagating modes increases exponentially until balancing that of the forward propagating modes. Thereafter there is no systematic net Hermite flux, so the electric field cannot decay and the nonlinearity effectively suppresses Landau damping. These simulations are performed using the fully-spectral 5D gyrokinetics code SpectroGK [Parker et al. 2014], modified to solve the 1+1D Vlasov-Poisson system. This captures Landau damping via an iterated L\'enard-Bernstein collision operator or via Hou-Li filtering in velocity space. Therefore the code is applicable even in regimes where phase-mixing and filamentation are dominant.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,0
Vector-Boson Fusion Higgs Pair Production at N$^3$LO,"We calculate the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) QCD corrections to vector-boson fusion (VBF) Higgs pair production in the limit in which there is no partonic exchange between the two protons. We show that the inclusive cross section receives negligible corrections at this order, while the scale variation uncertainties are reduced by a factor four. We present differential distributions for the transverse momentum and rapidity of the final state Higgs bosons, and show that there is almost no kinematic dependence to the third order corrections. Finally we study the impact of deviations from the Standard Model in the trilinear Higgs coupling, and show that the structure of the higher order corrections does not depend on the self-coupling.

However, it has not been clarified what kind of function spaces this representation is valid in. In the present paper, we try to find appropriate (pre-)Hilbert spaces in which the above representation is realized as an adjoint pair of operators. To this end, we define an inner product for the helicity eigenfunctions by an integral over the product space of the circular space S^{1} and the upper half of projective twistor space. Using this inner product, we define a Hilbert space in some particular case and indefinite-metric pre-Hilbert spaces in other particular cases, showing that the above- mentioned representation is valid in these spaces. It is also shown that only the Penrose transform in the first particular case yields positive-frequency massless fields without singularities, while the Penrose transforms in the other particular cases yield positive-frequency massless fields with singularities.",hep,hep-th,0
Heavy and light flavor jet quenching in different collision systems at the LHC energies,"Recent experiments have observed large anisotropic collective flows in high multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which indicates the possible formation of mini quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in small collision systems. However, no jet quenching has been confirmed in such small systems so far. To understand this intriguing result, the system size scan experiments have been proposed to bridge the gap between large and small systems. In this work, we perform a systematic study on both heavy and light flavor jet quenching in different collision systems at the LHC energies. Using our state-of-the-art jet quenching model, which combines the next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD framework, a linear Boltzmann transport model and the (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics simulation, we provide a good description of nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ for charged hadrons and $D$ mesons in central and mid-central Pb+Pb and Xe+Xe collisions measured by CMS collaboration. We further predict the transverse momentum and centrality dependences of $R_{AA}$ for charged hadrons, $D$ and $B$ mesons in Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, Ar+Ar and O+O collisions at the LHC energies. Our numerical results show a clear system size dependence for both light and heavy flavor hadron $R_{AA}$ across different collision systems. Sizable jet quenching effect is obtained for both heavy and light flavor hadrons in central O+O collisions at the LHC energies. Our study provides a significant bridge for jet quenching from large to small systems, and should be helpful for finding the smallest QGP droplet and the disappearance of QGP in relativistic nuclear collisions.",nucl,nucl-ex,Production mechanism of neutron-deficient actinide isotopes in complete fusion reactions and multinucleon transfer reactions,"Within the dinuclear system model, unknown neutron-deficient isotopes Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm are investigated in $^{40}$Ca, $^{36,40}$Ar, $^{32}$S, $^{28}$Si,$^{24}$Mg induced fusion-evaporation reactions and multinucleon transfer reactions with radioactive beams $^{59}$Cu,$^{69}$As,$^{90}$Nb,$^{91}$Tc, $^{94}$Rh, $^{105,110}$Sn, $^{118}$Xe induced with $^{238}$U near Coulomb barrier energies.

A statistical approach is used to evaluate the survival probability of excited nuclei via the both reaction mechanisms. A dynamical deformation is implemented into the model in the dissipation process. It is found that charge particle channels (alpha and proton) dominate in the decay process of proton-rich nuclides and the fusion-evaporation reactions are favorable to produce the new neutron-deficient actinide isotopes.

The bistability nature of the memristor introduces two discontinuty boundaries or switching manifolds in the circuit topology. As a result, the circuit becomes a piecewise smooth system of second order. Grazing bifurcations, which are essentially a form of discontinuity induced non-smooth bifurcations, occur at these boundaries and govern the dynamics of the circuit. While the interaction of the memristor aided self oscillations of the circuit and the external sinusoidal forcing result in the phenomenon of beats occurring in the circuit, grazing bifurcations endow them with chaotic and hyper chaotic nature. In addition the circuit admits a codimension-5 bifurcation and transient hyper chaos. Grazing bifurcations as well as other behaviors have been analyzed numerically using time series plots, phase portraits, bifurcation diagram, power spectra and Lyapunov spectrum, as well as the recent 0-1 K test for chaos, obtained after constructing a proper Zero Time Discontinuity Map (ZDM) and Poincare Discontinuity Map (PDM) analytically.

Effective boson-spin model for nuclei ensemble based universal quantum memory,"We study the collective excitation of a macroscopic ensemble of polarized nuclei fixed in a quantum dot. Under the approximately homogeneous condition that we explicitly present in this paper, this many-particle system behaves as a single mode boson interacting with the spin of a single conduction band electron confined in this quantum dot. Within this effective spin-boson system, the quantum information carried by the electronic spin can be coherently transferred into the collective bosonic mode of excitation in the ensemble of nuclei. In this sense, the collective bosonic excitation can serve as a stable quantum memory to store the quantum information of spin state of electron.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Nonreciprocal interactions give rise to fast cilium synchronisation in finite systems,"Motile cilia beat in an asymmetric fashion in order to propel the surrounding fluid. When many cilia are located on a surface, their beating can synchronise such that their phases form metachronal waves. Here, we computationally study a model where each cilium is represented as a spherical particle, moving along a tilted trajectory with a position-dependent active driving force and a position-dependent internal drag coefficient. The model thus takes into account all the essential broken symmetries of the ciliary beat. We show that taking into account the near-field hydrodynamic interactions, the effective coupling between cilia can become nonreciprocal: the phase of a cilium is more strongly affected by an adjacent cilium on one side than by a cilium at the same distance in the opposite direction. As a result, synchronisation starts from a seed at the edge of a group of cilia and propagates rapidly across the system, leading to a synchronisation time that scales proportionally to the linear dimension of the system. We show that a ciliary carpet is characterised by three different velocities: the velocity of fluid transport, the phase velocity of metachronal waves and the group velocity of order propagation. Unlike in systems with reciprocal coupling, boundary effects are not detrimental for synchronisation, but rather enable the formation of the initial seed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,0
Bistable analytic-phase synchronization in strongly-competing chaotic lasing modes,"We theoretically study analytic-phase synchronization in strongly-competing oscillator systems. Using the example of composite-cavity modes coupled via a class-B laser active medium, we discover that inherent chaotic phase synchronization can arise concurrently at two different chaotic attractors, leading to bistable phase-synchronized solutions.

Hierarchies of commuting symmetries of the HS equation are studied under appropriate changes of variables initiated by $\mathcal{T}_0$, and two of these are linearized while the other is identical to the hierarchy of commuting symmetries admitted by the potential modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. A fifth order symmetry of the HS equation is endowed with a sixth order hereditary recursion operator by its connection with the Fordy-Gibbons equation.

The Joint Cascade of Energy and Helicity in Three-Dimensional Turbulence,"Three-dimensional (3D) turbulence has both energy and helicity as inviscid constants of motion. In contrast to two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, where a second inviscid invariant--the enstrophy--blocks the energy cascade to small scales, in 3D there is a joint cascade of both energy and helicity simultaneously to small scales. The basic cancellation mechanism which permits a joint cascade of energy and helicity is illuminated by means of the helical decomposition of the velocity into positively and negatively polarized waves. This decomposition is employed in the present study both theoretically and also in a numerical simulation of homogeneous and isotropic 3D turbulence. It is shown that the transfer of energy to small scales produces a tremendous growth of helicity separately in the + and - helical modes at high wavenumbers, diverging in the limit of infinite Reynolds number. However, because of a tendency to restore reflection invariance at small scales, the net helicity from both modes remains finite in that limit. The net helicity flux is shown to be constant all the way up to the Kolmogorov wavenumber: there is no shorter inertial-range for helicity cascade than for energy cascade. The transfer of energy and helicity between + and - modes, which permits the joint cascade, is shown to be due to two distinct physical processes, advection and vortex stretching.",nlin,nlin.CD,Exact solutions of a mathematical model describing competition and co-existence of different language speakers,"The known three-component reaction-diffusion system modeling competition and co-existence of different language speakers is under study.

Evidence for the disintegration of KIC 12557548 b,"Context. The Kepler object KIC 12557548 b is peculiar. It exhibits transit-like features every 15.7 hours that vary in depth between 0.2% and 1.2%. Rappaport et al. (2012) explain the observations in terms of a disintegrating, rocky planet that has a trailing cloud of dust created and constantly replenished by thermal surface erosion. The variability of the transit depth is then a consequence of changes in the cloud optical depth. Aims. We aim to validate the disintegrating-planet scenario by modeling the detailed shape of the observed light curve, and thereby constrain the cloud particle properties to better understand the nature of this intriguing object. Methods. We analysed the six publicly-available quarters of raw Kepler data, phase-folded the light curve and fitted it to a model for the trailing dust cloud. Constraints on the particle properties were investigated with a light-scattering code. Results. The light curve exhibits clear signatures of light scattering and absorption by dust, including a brightening in flux just before ingress correlated with the transit depth and explained by forward scattering, and an asymmetry in the transit light curve shape, which is easily reproduced by an exponentially decaying distribution of optically thin dust, with a typical grain size of 0.1 micron. Conclusions. Our quantitative analysis supports the hypothesis that the transit signal of KIC 12557548 b is due to a variable cloud of dust, most likely originating from a disintegrating object.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,Ultrarelativistic black hole formation,"We study the ultrarelativistic head-on collision of equal mass particles, modeled as self-gravitating fluid spheres, by numerically solving the coupled Einstein-hydrodynamic equations. We focus on cases well within the kinetic energy dominated regime, where between 88-92% ($\gamma=8$ to 12) of the initial net energy of the spacetime resides in the translation kinetic energy of the particles. We find that for sufficiently large boosts, black hole formation occurs. Moreover, near yet above the threshold of black hole formation, the collision initially leads to the formation of two distinct apparent horizons that subsequently merge. We argue that this can be understood in terms of a focusing effect, where one boosted particle acts as a gravitational lens on the other and vice versa, and that this is further responsible for the threshold being lower (by a factor of a few) compared to simple hoop conjecture estimates. Cases slightly below threshold result in complete disruption of the model particles. The gravitational radiation emitted when black holes form reaches luminosities of 0.014 $c^5/G$, carrying $16\pm2%$ of the total energy.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,0
Distribution of captured planetesimals in circumplanetary gas disks and implications for accretion of regular satellites,"Regular satellites of giant planets are formed by accretion of solid bodies in circumplanetary disks. Planetesimals that are moving on heliocentric orbits and are sufficiently large to be decoupled from the flow of the protoplanetary gas disk can be captured by gas drag from the circumplanetary disk. In the present work, we examine the distribution of captured planetesimals in circumplanetary disks using orbital integrations. We find that the number of captured planetesimals reaches an equilibrium state as a balance between continuous capture and orbital decay into the planet. The number of planetesimals captured into retrograde orbits is much smaller than those on prograde orbits, because the former ones experience strong headwind and spiral into the planet rapidly. We find that the surface number density of planetesimals at the current radial location of regular satellites can be significantly enhanced by gas drag capture, depending on the velocity dispersions of planetesimals and the width of the gap in the protoplanetary disk. Using a simple model, we also examine the ratio of the surface densities of dust and captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk, and find that solid material at the current location of regular satellites can be dominated by captured planetesimals when the velocity dispersion of planetesimals is rather small and a wide gap is not formed in the protoplanetary disk. In this case, captured planetesimals in such a region can grow by mutual collision before spiraling into the planet, and would contribute to the growth of regular satellites.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey.

Using $\sim$100 deg$^{2}$ of $u^*giz$ imaging, we have identified more than 600 candidate UCDs, from the core of Virgo out to its virial radius. Candidates have been selected through a combination of magnitudes, ellipticities, colors, surface brightnesses, half-light radii and, when available, radial velocities. Candidates were also visually validated from deep NGVS images. Subsamples of varying completeness and purity have been defined to explore the properties of UCDs and compare to those of globular clusters and the nuclei of dwarf galaxies with the aim of delineating the nature and origins of UCDs. From a surface density map, we find the UCDs to be mostly concentrated within Virgo's main subclusters, around its brightest galaxies. We identify several subsamples of UCDs -- i.e., the brightest, largest, and those with the most pronounced and/or asymmetric envelopes -- that could hold clues to the origin of UCDs and possible evolutionary links with dwarf nuclei.

The initial amount of 40K in the interior of these planets depends on the composition of the interstellar clouds from which they formed. Within this context, nuclear reactions that regulate the production of 40K during stellar evolution can play a critical role. In this study, we constrain for the first time the astrophysical reaction rate of 40K(n,p)40Ar, which is responsible for the destruction of 40K during stellar nucleosynthesis. We performed differential cross-section measurements on the 40Ar(p,n)40K reaction, for six energies in the center-of-mass between 3.2 and 4.0 MeV and various angles between 0-deg and 135-deg. The experiment took place at the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory at Ohio University using the beam swinger target location and a standard neutron time-of-flight technique. The total and partial cross-sections varied with energy due to the contribution from isobaric analog states and Ericson type fluctuations. The energy-averaged neutron angular distributions were symmetrical relative to 90-deg and consistent with the theoretical predictions of the statistical model. Based on the experimental data, local transmission coefficients were extracted and were used to calculate the astrophysical reaction rates of 40Ar(p,n)40K and 40K(n,p)40Ar reactions. Our results support that the destruction rate of 40K in massive stars via the 40K(n,p)40Ar reaction is larger compared to previous estimates. This result directly affects the predicted stellar yields of 40K from nucleosynthesis, which is a critical input parameter for the galactic chemical evolution models that are currently employed for the study of significant properties of exoplanets.",nucl,nucl-ex,0
Seed Population Pre-Conditioning and Acceleration Observed by Parker Solar Probe,"A series of solar energetic particle (SEP) events were observed at Parker Solar Probe (PSP) by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (\ISOIS) during the period from April 18, 2019 through April 24, 2019. The PSP spacecraft was located near 0.48 au from the Sun on Parker spiral field lines that projected out to 1 au within $\sim 25^\circ$ of near Earth spacecraft. These SEP events, though small compared to historically large SEP events, were amongst the largest observed thus far in the PSP mission and provide critical information about the space environment inside 1 au during SEP events. During this period the Sun released multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs). One of these CMEs observed was initiated on April 20, 2019 at 01:25 UTC, and the interplanetary CME (ICME) propagated out and passed over the PSP spacecraft. Observations by the Electromagnetic Fields Investigation (FIELDS) show that the magnetic field structure was mostly radial throughout the passage of the compression region and the plasma that followed, indicating that PSP did not directly observe a flux rope internal to the ICME, consistent with the location of PSP on the ICME flank. Analysis using relativistic electrons observed near Earth by the Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor (EPAM) on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) demonstrates the presence of electron seed populations (40--300 keV) during the events observed. The energy spectrum of the \ISOIS~ observed proton seed population below 1 MeV is close to the limit of possible stationary state plasma distributions out of equilibrium. \ISOIS~ observations reveal the \revise{enhancement} of seed populations during the passage of the ICME, which \revise{likely indicates a key part} of the pre-acceleration process that occurs close to the Sun.",physics,physics.space-ph,Revealing a full quantum ladder by nonlinear spectroscopy,"Coherent two-dimensional spectroscopy in IR or visible region is very effective for studying correlations, energy relaxation/transfer pathways in complex multi-chromophore or multi-mode systems. However it is usually restricted up to two-quanta excitations and their properties. In this paper an arbitrary level of excitation is suggested as the utility to scan nonlinear potential surfaces of quantum systems up to a desired excitation degree. This can be achieved by a simple three-pulse laser spectroscopy approach. Accurate evaluation of high-level anharmonicities as well as transition amplitudes can be directly obtained. Additionally, questions regarding the quantum nature of the probed system can be addressed by studying absolute peak positions.",physics,physics.chem-ph,0
Dipolar quantization and the infinite circumference limit of two-dimensional conformal field theories,"Elaborating on our previous presentation, where the term {\it dipolar quantization} was introduced, we argue here that adopting $L_0-(L_1+L_{-1})/2+{\bar L}_0-({\bar L}_1+{\bar L}_{-1})/2$ as the Hamiltonian instead of $L_0+{\bar L}_0$ yields an infinite circumference limit in two-dimensional conformal field theory. The new Hamiltonian leads to dipolar quantization instead of radial quantization. As a result, the new theory exhibits a continuous and strongly degenerated spectrum in addition to the Virasoro algebra with a continuous index. Its Hilbert space exhibits a different inner product than that obtained in the original theory. The idiosyncrasy of this particular Hamiltonian is its relation to the so-called sine-square deformation, which is found in the study of a certain class of quantum statistical systems. The appearance of the infinite circumference explains why the vacuum states of sine-square deformed systems are coincident with those of the respective closed-boundary systems.",hep,hep-th,Non-perturbative renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory,We present a strategy for a non-perturbative determination of the finite renormalization constants of the energy-momentum tensor in the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory.

SIDRA: a blind algorithm for signal detection in photometric surveys,"We present the Signal Detection using Random-Forest Algorithm (SIDRA). SIDRA is a detection and classification algorithm based on the Machine Learning technique (Random Forest). The goal of this paper is to show the power of SIDRA for quick and accurate signal detection and classification. We first diagnose the power of the method with simulated light curves and try it on a subset of the Kepler space mission catalogue. We use five classes of simulated light curves (CONSTANT, TRANSIT, VARIABLE, MLENS and EB for constant light curves, transiting exoplanet, variable, microlensing events and eclipsing binaries, respectively) to analyse the power of the method. The algorithm uses four features in order to classify the light curves. The training sample contains 5000 light curves (1000 from each class) and 50000 random light curves for testing. The total SIDRA success ratio is $\geq 90\%$. Furthermore, the success ratio reaches 95 - 100$\%$ for the CONSTANT, VARIABLE, EB, and MLENS classes and 92$\%$ for the TRANSIT class with a decision probability of 60$\%$. Because the TRANSIT class is the one which fails the most, we run a simultaneous fit using SIDRA and a Box Least Square (BLS) based algorithm for searching for transiting exoplanets. As a result, our algorithm detects 7.5$\%$ more planets than a classic BLS algorithm, with better results for lower signal-to-noise light curves. SIDRA succeeds to catch 98$\%$ of the planet candidates in the Kepler sample and fails for 7$\%$ of the false alarms subset. SIDRA promises to be useful for developing a detection algorithm and/or classifier for large photometric surveys such as TESS and PLATO exoplanet future space missions.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,"Synthetic CO, H2 and HI surveys of the Galactic 2nd Quadrant, and the properties of molecular gas","We present CO, H2, HI and HISA distributions from a set of simulations of grand design spirals including stellar feedback, self-gravity, heating and cooling. We replicate the emission of the 2nd Galactic Quadrant by placing the observer inside the modelled galaxies and post process the simulations using a radiative transfer code, so as to create synthetic observations. We compare the synthetic datacubes to observations of the 2nd Quadrant of the Milky Way to test the ability of the current models to reproduce the basic chemistry of the Galactic ISM, as well as to test how sensitive such galaxy models are to different recipes of chemistry and/or feedback. We find that models which include feedback and self-gravity can reproduce the production of CO with respect to H2 as observed in our Galaxy, as well as the distribution of the material perpendicular to the Galactic plane. While changes in the chemistry/feedback recipes do not have a huge impact on the statistical properties of the chemistry in the simulated galaxies, we find that the inclusion of both feedback and self-gravity are crucial ingredients, as our test without feedback failed to reproduce all of the observables. Finally, even though the transition from H2 to CO seems to be robust, we find that all models seem to underproduce molecular gas, and have a lower molecular to atomic gas fraction than is observed. Nevertheless, our fiducial model with feedback and self-gravity has shown to be robust in reproducing the statistical properties of the basic molecular gas components of the ISM in our Galaxy.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
Attosecond XUV probing of vibronic quantum superpositions in Br$_2^+$,"Ultrafast laser excitation can create coherent superpositions of electronic states in molecules and trigger ultrafast flow of electron density on few- to sub-femtosecond time scales. While recent attosecond experiments have addressed real-time observation of these primary photochemical processes, the underlying roles of simultaneous nuclear motions and how they modify and disturb the valence electronic motion remain uncertain. Here, we investigate coherent electronic-vibrational dynamics induced among multiple vibronic levels of ionic bromine (Br$_2^+$), including both spin-orbit and valence electronic superpositions, using attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Decay, revival, and apparent frequency shifts of electronic coherences are measured via characteristic quantum beats on the Br-$3d$ core-level absorption signals. Quantum-mechanical simulations attribute the observed electronic decoherence to broadened phase distributions of nuclear wave packets on anharmonic potentials. Molecular vibronic structure is further revealed to be imprinted as discrete progressions in electronic beat frequencies. These results provide a future basis to interpret complex charge-migration dynamics in polyatomic systems.",physics,physics.chem-ph,Video-based analysis of the transition from slipping to rolling,"The problem of a disc or cylinder initially rolling with slipping on a surface and subsequently transitioning to rolling without slipping is often cited in textbooks. The following experiment serves to clearly demonstrate the transition from rolling with slipping to rolling without slipping. In the experiment, a rotating bicycle wheel was placed in contact with a horizontal surface and the wheel in motion was tracked using Tracker video analysis software [8]. The software created linear velocity plots for the centre of mass and a point on the circumference as well as a plot of the angular velocity of the rotating wheel. The time evolution plots created by Tracker clearly illustrate the transition between the two types of motion.",physics,physics.ed-ph,0
The Isgur-Wise Function from the Lattice,"We calculate the Isgur-Wise function by measuring the elastic scattering amplitude of a $D$ meson in the quenched approximation on a $24^3\times48$ lattice at $\beta=6.2$, using an $O(a)$-improved fermion action. Fitting the resulting chirally-extrapolated Isgur-Wise function to Stech's relativistic-oscillator parametrization, we obtain a slope parameter $\rho^2=1.2+7-3. We then use this result, in conjunction with heavy-quark symmetry, to extract $V_{cb}$\ from the experimentally measured $\bar B\to D^*l\bar\nu\,$\ differential decay width. We find $|V_{cb}|\sqrt{\tau_B/1.48{\mathrm ps}}= 0.038 +2-2 +8-3, where the first set of errors is due to experimental uncertainties, while the second is due to the uncertainty in our lattice determination of $\rho^2$.",hep,hep-lat,MOND--particularly as modified inertia,"After a succinct review of the MOND paradigm--with its phenomenology, and its various underlying theories--I concentrate on so called modified inertia (MI) formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention. These share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed relation. My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ substantially from their ""modified-gravity"" (MG) kin in predicting other phenomena. Because MI theories are non local in time, MOND effects depend on the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG theories. This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not only on the instantaneous value. And, it is even possible to construct MI theories with practically no EFE. Other predictions that may differ are also discussed. Since we do not yet have a full fledged, modified-inertia formulation, simple, heuristic models have been used to demonstrate these points.",hep,hep-ph,0
The accurate and comprehensive model of thin fluid flows with inertia on curved substrates,"Consider the 3D flow of a viscous Newtonian fluid upon a curved 2D substrate when the fluid film is thin as occurs in many draining, coating and biological flows. We derive a comprehensive model of the dynamics of the film, the model being expressed in terms of the film thickness and the average lateral velocity. Based upon centre manifold theory, we are assured that the model accurately includes the effects of the curvature of substrate, gravitational body force, fluid inertia and dissipation. The model may be used to resolve wave-like phenomena in the dynamics of viscous fluid flows over arbitrarily curved substrates such as cylinders, tubes and spheres. We briefly illustrate its use in simulating drop formation on cylindrical fibres, wave transitions, Faraday waves, viscous hydraulic jumps, and flow vortices in a compound channel. These models are the most complete models for thin film flow of a Newtonian fluid; many other thin film models can be obtained by different truncations of the dynamical equations given herein.",nlin,nlin.CD,"Linear Darboux polynomials for Lotka-Volterra systems, trees and superintegrable families","We present a method to construct superintegrable $n$-component Lotka-Volterra systems with $3n-2$ parameters.

African Dust Influence on Atlantic Hurricane Activity and the Peculiar Behaviour of Category 5 Hurricanes,"We study the specific influence of African dust on each one of the categories of Atlantic hurricanes. By applying wavelet analysis, we find a strong decadal modulation of African dust on Category 5 hurricanes and an annual modulation on all other categories of hurricanes. We identify the formation of Category 5 hurricanes occurring mainly around the decadal minimum variation of African dust and in deep water areas of the Atlantic Ocean, where hurricane eyes have the lowest pressure. According to our results, future tropical cyclones will not evolve to Category 5 until the next decadal minimum that is, by the year 2015 +/- 2.",physics,physics.ao-ph,Modeling Short-Range and Three-Membered Ring Structures in Lithium Borosilicate Glasses using Machine Learning Potential,"Lithium borosilicate (LBS) glass is a prototypical lithium-ion conducting oxide glasses available for an all-solid state buttery. Nevertheless, the atomistic modeling of LBS glass using $ab$ $initio$ (AIMD) and classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations have critical limitations due to computational cost and inaccuracy in reproducing the glass microstructures, respectively. To overcome these difficulties, a machine-learning potential (MLP) was examined in this work for modeling LBS glasses using DeepMD. The glass structures obtained by this MLP possessed fourhold-coordinated boron ($^4$B) confirmed well with the experimental data and abundance of three-membered rings. The models were energetically more stable compared with those constructed with a functional force-field even though both the models included reasonable $^4$B. The results confirmed MLP to be superior to model the boron-containing glasses and address the inherent shortcomings of the AIMD and CMD. This study also discusses some limitations of MLP for modeling glasses.",physics,physics.chem-ph,0
Strange Nonchaotic Attractors in Harper Maps,"We study the existence of Strange Nonchaotic Attractors (SNA) in the family of Harper maps, proving that they are typical but not robust in this family.

In a previous study [Idris and Biktashev 2008] set out to separate initial (or boundary) conditions leading to propagation wave solutions from those leading to decay solutions, an analytical criterion based on an approximation of the (center-)stable manifold of a certain critical solution was presented. The theoretical prediction in the case of strength-extent curve was later on extended to cover a wider class of excitable systems including multicomponent reaction-diffusion systems, systems with non-self-adjoint linearized operators and in particular, systems with moving critical solutions (critical fronts and critical pulses) [Bezekci et al. 2015]. In the present work, we consider extension of the theory to the case of strength-duration curve.",nlin,nlin.PS,0
Effect of Thermal Fluctuations on a Charged Dilatonic Black Saturn,"In this paper, we will analyze the effect of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of a charged dilatonic black Saturn. These thermal fluctuations will correct the thermodynamics of the charged dilatonic black Saturn. We will analyze the corrections to the thermodynamics of this system by first relating the fluctuations in the entropy to the fluctuations in the energy. Then, we will use the relation between entropy and a conformal field theory to analyze the fluctuations in the entropy. We will demonstrate that similar physical results are obtained from both these approaches. We will also study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the phase transition in this charged dilatonic black Saturn.",hep,hep-th,Topology on the lattice; 2d Yang-Mills theories with a theta term,"We study two-dimensional U($N$) and SU($N$) gauge theories with a topological term on arbitrary surfaces. Starting from a lattice formulation we derive the continuum limit of the action which turns out to be a generalisation of the heat kernel in the presence of a topological term. In the continuum limit we can reconstruct the topological information encoded in the theta term. In the topologically trivial cases the theta term gives only a trivial shift to the ground state energy but in the topologically nontrivial ones it remains to be coupled to the dynamics in the continuum. In particular for the U($N$) gauge group on orientable surfaces it gives rise to a phase transition at $\theta= \pi$, similar to the ones observed in other models. Using the equivalence of 2d QCD and a 1d fermion gas on a circle we rewrite our result in the fermionic language and show that the theta term can be also interpreted as an external magnetic field imposed on the fermions.",hep,hep-lat,0
Granular Impact Model as an Energy-Depth Relation,"Velocity-squared drag forces are common in describing an object moving through a granular material. The resulting force law is a nonlinear differential equation, and closed-form solutions of the dynamics are typically obtained by making simplifying assumptions. Here, we consider a generalized version of such a force law which has been used in many studies of granular impact. We show that recasting the force law into an equation for the kinetic energy versus depth, K(z), yields a linear differential equation, and thus general closed-form solutions for the velocity versus depth. This approach also has several advantages in fitting such models to experimental data, which we demonstrate by applying it to data from 2D impact experiments. We also present new experimental results for this model, including shape and depth dependence of the velocity-squared drag force.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Impact of the crystal electric field on magnetocaloric properties of CsGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$,"Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) was investigated in the single crystal of CsGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ in the temperature range from 2 to 30 K and fields up to 5 T applied along the easy and hard magnetic axis. The analysis of specific heat and magnetization provided the refinement of crystal electric field (CEF) parameters supporting the dominance of uniaxial symmetry. The knowledge of CEF energy levels enabled the extrapolation of MCE parameters outside the experimental region. Consequently, maximum values of the isothermal entropy change, $-\Delta S_{\rm M}$, in magnetic fields up to 5 T are expected to occur at temperatures between 1 and 2 K. While $-\Delta S_{\rm M}$ achieves 19.2 J/kgK already for the field 1 T, for the field change 7 T, maximal $-\Delta S_{\rm M}$ $\approx$ 26.8 J/kgK with a refrigerant capacity of 215 J/kg is expected. The absence of thermal hysteresis and the losses due to eddy currents as well as good chemical stability makes the compound CsGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ attractive for magnetic refrigeration at low temperatures. The possibilities of further enhancement of MCE parameters are discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,0
Matrix model and Yukawa couplings on the noncommutative torus,"The IKKT model is proposed as a non-perturbative formulation of superstring theory.

A new computational method for a model of C. elegans biomechanics: Insights into elasticity and locomotion performance,"An organism's ability to move freely is a fundamental behaviour in the animal kingdom. To understand animal locomotion requires a characterisation of the material properties, as well as the biomechanics and physiology. We present a biomechanical model of C. elegans locomotion together with a novel finite element method. We formulate our model as a nonlinear initial-boundary value problem which allows the study of the dynamics of arbitrary body shapes, undulation gaits and the link between the animal's material properties and its performance across a range of environments. Our model replicates behaviours across a wide range of environments. It makes strong predictions on the viable range of the worm's Young's modulus and suggests that animals can control speed via the known mechanism of gait modulation that is observed across different media.",physics,physics.bio-ph,Neural Networks for Constitutive Modeling -- From Universal Function Approximators to Advanced Models and the Integration of Physics,"Analyzing and modeling the constitutive behavior of materials is a core area in materials sciences and a prerequisite for conducting numerical simulations in which the material behavior plays a central role. Constitutive models have been developed since the beginning of the 19th century and are still under constant development. Besides physics-motivated and phenomenological models, during the last decades, the field of constitutive modeling was enriched by the development of machine learning-based constitutive models, especially by using neural networks. The latter is the focus of the present review, which aims to give an overview of neural networks-based constitutive models from a methodical perspective. The review summarizes and compares numerous conceptually different neural networks-based approaches for constitutive modeling including neural networks used as universal function approximators, advanced neural network models and neural network approaches with integrated physical knowledge. The upcoming of these methods is in-turn closely related to advances in the area of computer sciences, what further adds a chronological aspect to this review.

These parameters are the hadron mass, leptonic decay constant, total width, and continuum threshold ($s_0$). Results for $s_0(T)$ in both channels indicate that $s_0(T)$ starts approximately constant, and then it decreases monotonically with increasing $T$ until it reaches the QCD threshold, $s_{th} = 4 m_Q^2$, at a critical temperature $T = T_c \simeq 180 \; \mbox{MeV}$ interpreted as the deconfinement temperature. The other hadronic parameters behave qualitatively similarly to those of the $J/\psi$, as determined in this same framework. The hadron mass is essentially constant, the total width is initially independent of T, and after $T/T_c \simeq 0.80$ it begins to increase with increasing $T$ up to $T/T_c \simeq 0.90 \; (0.95)$ for $\chi_c$ ($\eta_c$), and subsequently it decreases sharply up to $T \simeq 0.94 \; (0.99) \; T_c$, for $\chi_c$ ($\eta_c$), beyond which the sum rules are no longer valid. The decay constant of $\chi_c$ at first remains basically flat up to $T \simeq 0.80\; T_c$, then it starts to decrease up to $T \simeq 0.90 \;T_c$, and finally it increases sharply with increasing $T$. In the case of $\eta_c$ the decay constant does not change up to $T \simeq 0.80 \;T_c$ where it begins a gentle increase up to $T \simeq 0.95 \;T_c$ beyond which it increases dramatically with increasing $T$. This behaviour contrasts with that of light-light and heavy-light quark systems, and it suggests the survival of the $\eta_c$ and the $\chi_c$ states beyond the critical temperature, as already found for the $J/\psi$ from similar QCD sum rules. These conclusions are very stable against changes in the critical temperature in the wide range $T_c = 180 - 260 \; \mbox{MeV}$.",hep,hep-lat,0
"Three-dimensional pattern formation, multiple homogeneous soft modes, and nonlinear dielectric electroconvection","Patterns forming spontaneously in extended, three-dimensional, dissipative systems are likely to excite several homogeneous soft modes ($\approx$ hydrodynamic modes) of the underlying physical system, much more than quasi one- and two-dimensional patterns are. The reason is the lack of damping boundaries. This paper compares two analytic techniques to derive the patten dynamics from hydrodynamics, which are usually equivalent but lead to different results when applied to multiple homogeneous soft modes. Dielectric electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals is introduced as a model for three-dimensional pattern formation. The 3D pattern dynamics including soft modes are derived. For slabs of large but finite thickness the description is reduced further to a two-dimensional one. It is argued that the range of validity of 2D descriptions is limited to a very small region above threshold. The transition from 2D to 3D pattern dynamics is discussed. Experimentally testable predictions for the stable range of ideal patterns and the electric Nusselt numbers are made. For most results analytic approximations in terms of material parameters are given.",nlin,nlin.PS,Extensive numerical study and circuitry implementation of the Watt governor model,"In this work we carry out extensive numerical study of a Watt-centrifugal-governor system model, and we also implement an electronic circuit by analog computation to experimentally solve the model.

A peculiar hierarchical organization and period-adding bifurcation cascade of the SPSs are observed, and this self-organized cascade accumulates on a periodic boundary. It is also shown that the periods of these structures organize themselves obeying the solutions of Diophantine equations. In addition, an experimental setup is implemented by a circuitry analogy of mechanical systems using analog computing technique to characterize the robustness of our numerical results. After applying an active control of chaos in the experiment, the effect of intrinsic experimental noise was minimized such that, the experimental results are in astonishing well agreement with our numerical findings. We can also mention as another remarkable result, the application of analog computing technique to perform an experimental circuitry analysis in real mechanical problems.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Alternating lags of QPO harmonics : A Generic model and its application to the 67 millihertz QPO of GRS 1915+105,"A generic model for alternating lags in QPO harmonics is presented where variations in the photon spectrum are caused by oscillations in two parameters that characterize the spectrum. It is further assumed that variations in one of the parameters is linearly driven by variations in the other after a time delay $t_d$. It is shown that alternating lags will be observed for a range of $t_d$ values. A phenomenological model based on this generic one is developed which can explain the amplitude and phase lag variation with energy of the fundamental and the next three harmonics of the 67 mHz QPO observed in GRS 1915+105. The phenomenological model also predicts the variation of the Bicoherence phase with energy, which can be checked by further analysis of the observational data.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Precision Weak Gravitational Lensing Using Velocity Fields: Fisher Matrix Analysis,"Weak gravitational lensing measurements based on photometry are limited by shape noise, the variance in the unknown unlensed orientations of the source galaxies. If the source is a disk galaxy with a well-ordered velocity field, however, velocity field data can support simultaneous inference of the shear, inclination, and position angle, virtually eliminating shape noise. We use the Fisher Information Matrix formalism to forecast the precision of this method in the idealized case of a perfectly ordered velocity field defined on an infinitesimally thin disk. For nearly face-on targets one shear component, $\gamma_\times$, can be constrained to $0.003\frac{90}{I_0}\frac{25}{n_{\rm pix}}$ where $I_0$ is the S/N of the central intensity pixel and $n_{\rm pix}$ is the number of pixels across a diameter enclosing 80\% of the light. This precision degrades with inclination angle, by a factor of three by $i{=}50^\circ$. Uncertainty on the other shear component, $\gamma_+$, is about 1.5 (7) times larger than the $\gamma_\times$ uncertainty for targets at $i=10^\circ$ ($50^\circ$). For arbitrary galaxy position angle on the sky, these forecasts apply not to $\gamma_+$ and $\gamma_\times$ as defined on the sky, but to two eigenvectors in $(\gamma_+, \gamma_\times,\mu)$ space where $\mu$ is the magnification. We also forecast the potential of less expensive partial observations of the velocity field such as slit spectroscopy. We conclude by outlining some ways in which real galaxies depart from our idealized model and thus create random or systematic uncertainties not captured here. In particular, our forecast $\gamma_\times$ precision is currently limited only by the data quality rather than scatter in galaxy properties because the relevant type of scatter has yet to be measured.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,0
Phase stability of Fe from first-principles: atomistic spin dynamics coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic integration,"The calculation of free energies from first principles in materials is a formidable task which enables the prediction of phase stability with high accuracy; these calculations are complicated in magnetic materials by the interplay of electronic, magnetic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. In this work, we show the feasibility and accuracy of the calculation of phase stability in magnetic systems with ab initio methods and thermodynamic integration by sampling the magnetic and vibrational phase space with coupled atomistic spin dynamics-ab initio molecular dynamics (ASD-AIMD) simulations [Stockem et al., PRL 121, 125902 (2018)], where energies and interatomic forces are calculated with density functional theory (DFT). We employ the method to calculate the phase stability of Fe at ambient pressure from 800 K up to 1800 K. The Gibbs free energy difference between fcc and bcc Fe at zero pressure as a function of temperature is calculated carrying out thermodynamic integration over temperature on the energies at the DFT level from ASD-AIMD, using a reference free energy difference calculated in the paramagnetic state at temperatures much higher than the magnetic transition temperatures with thermodynamic integration over stress-strain variables with disordered local moment (DLM)-AIMD simulations. We show the importance of the magnetic ordering temperature of bcc Fe on the $\alpha$ to $\gamma$ structural transition temperature, whereas the $\gamma$ to $\delta$ transition is well reproduced independently of the exchange interactions. The Gibbs free energy difference between the two structures is within 5 meV/atom from the CALPHAD estimate, and both transition temperatures are reproduced within 150 K. The present work paves the way to free energy calculations in magnetic materials from first principles with accuracy in the order of 1 meV/atom.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Accurate calculation of the transverse anisotropy in perpendicularly magnetized multilayers,"The transverse anisotropy constant and the related D\""oring mass density are key parameters of the one-dimensional model to describe the motion of magnetic domain walls. So far, no general framework is available to determine these quantities from static characterizations such as magnetometry measurements. Here, we derive a universal analytical expression to calculate the transverse anisotropy constant for the important class of perpendicular magnetic multilayers. All the required input parameters of the model, such as the number of repeats, the thickness of a single magnetic layer, and the layer periodicity, as well as the effective perpendicular anisotropy, the saturation magnetization, and the static domain wall width are accessible by static sample characterizations. We apply our model to a widely used multilayer system and find that the effective transverse anisotropy constant is a factor 7 different from the when using the conventional approximations, showing the importance of using our analysis scheme.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,0
Resonant metallic states in driven quasiperiodic lattices,"We consider a quasiperiodic Aubry-Andre (AA) model and add a weak time-periodic and spatially quasiperiodic perturbation. The undriven AA model is chosen to be well in the insulating regime. The spatial quasiperiodic perturbation extends the model into two dimensions in reciprocal space. For a spatial resonance which reduces the reciprocal space dynamics to an effective one-dimensional two-leg ladder case, the ac perturbation resonantly couples certain groups of localized eigenstates of the undriven AA model and turns them into extended metallic ones. Slight detuning of the spatial and temporal frequencies off resonance returns these states into localized ones. We analyze the details of the resonant metallic eigenstates using Floquet representations. In particular, we find that their size grows linearly with the system size. Initial wave packets overlap with resonant metallic eigenstates and lead to ballistic spreading.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,Effects of self-consistency and plasmon-pole models on GW calculations for closed-shell molecules,"We present theoretical calculations of quasiparticle energies in closed-shell molecules using the GW method. We compare three different approaches: a full-frequency $G_0W_0$ (FF-$G_0W_0$) method with density functional theory (DFT-PBE) used as a starting mean field; a full-frequency $GW_0$ (FF-$GW_0$) method where the interacting Green's function is approximated by replacing the DFT energies with self-consistent quasiparticle energies or Hartree-Fock energies; and a $G_0W_0$ method with a Hybertsen-Louie generalized plasmon-pole model (HL GPP-$G_0W_0$). While the latter two methods lead to good agreement with experimental ionization potentials and electron affinities for methane, ozone, and beryllium oxide molecules, FF-$G_0W_0$ results can differ by more than one electron volt from experiment. We trace this failure of the FF-$G_0W_0$ method to the occurrence of incorrect self-energy poles describing shake-up processes in the vicinity of the quasiparticle energies.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,0
A covering theory of special relativity,"Under the assumption of closed-path velocity of light invariant, we show both the general expression of velocity of light in an ordinary inertial reference frame and the generalized Lorentz transformation between the ordinary inertial reference frame and the absolute (privileged) reference frame. Although such assumption can not determine theory ambiguously, some significant results can still be obtained by the assumption. Furthermore, the study shows that the relativity of simultaneity is not a universal concept.",physics,physics.class-ph,Mie Resonance Enhancement of Laser Cooling in Rare-Earth Doped Materials,"Laser cooling of solids keeps attracting attention owing to abroad range of its applications that extends from cm-sized all-optical cryocoolers for airborne and space-based applications to cooling on nanoparticles for biological and mesoscopic physics. Laser cooling of nanoparticles is a challenging task. We propose to use Mie resonances to enhance anti-Stokes fluorescence laser cooling in rare-earth (RE) doped nanoparticles made of low-phonon glasses or crystals. As an example, we consider an Yb3+:YAG nanosphere pumped at the long wavelength tail of the Yb3+ absorption spectrum at 1030 nm. We show that if the radius of the nanosphere is adjusted to the pump wavelength in such a manner that the pump excites some of its Mie resonant modes, the cooling power density generated in the sample is considerably enhanced and the temperature of the sample is consequently considerably (~ 63%) decreased. This concept can be extended to nanoparticles of different shapes and made from different low-phonon RE doped materials suitable for laser cooling by anti-Stokes fluorescence.",physics,physics.app-ph,0
Experimental and First principle calculation of Co_xNi_{(1-x)}Si solid solution structural stability,"We report the investigation of the structural stability of Co$_{(1-x)}$Ni$_x$Si monosilicides for $0<x<1$. As CoSi crystallizes in the FeSi-type structure (B20) and NiSi is stable in the MnP-type structure (B31), a complete set of samples has been synthesized and a systematic study of phase formation under different annealing conditions were carried out in order to understand the reason of such a structural transition when x goes from 0 to 1. This study has revealed a limit in the solubility of Ni in CoSi B20 structure of about 17.5 at.% and of Co in NiSi B31 phase of about 13 at.%. For $0.35<x<0.74$ both B20 and B31 phases are present in the sample at there respective limits of solubility. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility has also been measured revealing diamagnetic behaviors. Optimal structural parameters and phase stability of the solid solution have been investigated using self-consistent full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method (FP-LAPW) based on the density functional theory (DFT). This calculation well predicts the structural instability observed experimentally.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,Polymer Principles of Protein Calorimetric Two-State Cooperativity,"The experimental calorimetric two-state criterion requires the van't Hoff enthalpy $\Delta H_{\rm vH}$ around the folding/unfolding transition midpoint to be equal or very close to the calorimetric enthalpy $\Delta H_{\rm cal}$ of the entire transition. We use an analytical model with experimental parameters from chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 to elucidate the relationship among several different van't Hoff enthalpies used in calorimetric analyses. Under reasonable assumptions, the implications of these $\Delta H_{\rm vH}$'s being approximately equal to $\Delta H_{\rm cal}$ are equivalent: Enthalpic variations among denatured conformations in real proteins are much narrower than some previous lattice-model estimates, suggesting that the energy landscape theory ``folding to glass transition temperature ratio'' $T_{\rm f}/T_{\rm g}$ may exceed 6.0 for real calorimetrically two-state proteins. Several popular three-dimensional lattice protein models, with different numbers of residue types in their alphabets, are found to fall short of the high experimental standard for being calorimetrically two-state. Some models postulate a multiple-conformation native state with substantial pre-denaturational energetic fluctuations well below the unfolding transition temperature and/or predict a significant post-denaturational continuous conformational expansion of the denatured ensemble at temperatures well above the transition point.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,0
Variability of eclipse timing:the case of V471 Tauri,"The post-common envelope binary V471 Tauri has been an object of interest for decades. V471 Tau shows various phenomena due to its evolutionary state and unique properties, e.g. its magnetic accretion and eclipse timing variation (ETV). Previous authors explained the ETVs by different, sometimes contradictory theories. In this paper, we present and analyse the variability of the eclipse timing of this star. We observed V471 Tauri over the last ten years and covered the second cycle of its period variation. Based on our analysis of the presented data, we assess the possible existence of a brown dwarf in this system and derive its orbital parameters. We compare the results of our dynamical modelling to the solution predicted by Applegate-mechanism theories, which have been developed in recent studies. We found that the observed ETV cannot be explained only by the presence of additional components to the binary.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Prospects for Galactic transient sources detection with the Cherenkov Telescope Array,"Several types of Galactic sources, like magnetars, microquasars, novae or pulsar wind nebulae flares, display transient emission in the X-ray band. Some of these sources have also shown emission at MeV--GeV energies. However, none of these Galactic transients have ever been detected in the very-high-energy (VHE; E$>$100 GeV) regime by any Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT). The Galactic Transient task force is a part of the Transient Working group of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium. The task force investigates the prospects of detecting the VHE counterpart of such sources, as well as their study following Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations. In this contribution, we will show some of the results of exploring the capabilities of CTA to detect and observe Galactic transients; we assume different array configurations and observing strategies.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,0
Active control of transport through nanopores,"Passive particle transport through narrow channels is well studied, while for active particle systems, it is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate the active control of the transport through a nanopore via mean-field analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. We prove that the active force enhances the transport efficiency with an effective diffusion coefficient $D_{eff} = D_t (1 + Pe^2/6)$, where $D_t$ is the translational diffusion coefficient, and $Pe$ is the P\'{e}clet number that determines the strength of the active force. For the number of particles inside the channel, it experiences subdiffusion at short times and then turns to normal at longer times. Finally, we extend our research for several sinusoidal shapes of the channel surface. More particles are trapped in the channel if the roughness of the channel surface is increased, resulting in fewer particles are transported from one side of the channel to the other.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Quantum oscillations and upper critical magnetic field of the iron-based superconductor FeSe,"Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and upper critical magnetic field ($H\_{c2}$) of the iron-based superconductor FeSe ($T\_c$ = 8.6 K) have been studied by tunnel diode oscillator-based measurements in magnetic fields of up to 55 T and temperatures down to 1.6 K. Several Fourier components enter the SdH oscillations spectrum with frequencies definitely smaller than predicted by band structure calculations indicating band renormalization and reconstruction of the Fermi surface at low temperature, in line with previous ARPES data. The Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model accounts for the temperature dependence of $H\_{c2}$ for magnetic field applied both parallel (\textbf{H} $\|$ $ab$) and perpendicular (\textbf{H} $\|$ $c$) to the iron conducting plane, suggesting that one band mainly controls the superconducting properties in magnetic fields despite the multiband nature of the Fermi surface. Whereas Pauli pair breaking is negligible for \textbf{H} $\|$ $c$, a Pauli paramagnetic contribution is evidenced for \textbf{H} $\|$ $ab$ with Maki parameter $\alpha$ = 2.1, corresponding to Pauli field $H\_{P}$ = 36.5 T",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,0
Radial flow of kaon mesons in heavy ion reactions,"This work investigates the collective motion of kaons in heavy ion reactions at SIS energies (about 1-2 GeV/nucleon). A radial collective flow of $K^+$ mesons is predicted to exist in central Au + Au collisions, which manifests in a characteristic ""shoulder-arm"" shape of the transverse mass spectrum of the midrapidity $K^+$ mesons. The $K^+$ radial flow arises from the repulsive $K^+$ mean field in nuclear matter. In spite of a strong reabsorption and rescattering the attractive $K^-$ mean field leads as well to a collective radial flow of $K^-$ mesons. The $K^-$ radial flow, however, is different from that of $K^+$ mesons and can be observed by a characteristic ""concave"" structure of the transverse mass spectrum of the $K^-$ mesons emitted at midrapidity. The kaon radial flows can therefore serve as a novel tool for the investigation of kaon properties in dense nuclear matter.",nucl,nucl-th,Measurement of GEp/GMp in ep -> ep to Q2 = 5.6 GeV2,"The ratio of the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton, GEp/GMp, was measured at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) using the recoil polarization technique.

(2011). A sequence of photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms produced by SDO/HMI are used to drive the simulation and continuously evolve the coronal magnetic field of the active region through a series of non-linear force-free equilibria. The simulation is started during the first stages of the active region emergence so that its full evolution from emergence to decay can be simulated. A comparison of the simulation results with SDO/AIA observations show that many aspects of the active region's observed coronal evolution are reproduced. In particular, it shows the presence of a flux rope, which forms at the same location as sheared coronal loops in the observations. The observations show that eruptions occur on 2012 March 17 at 05:09 UT and 10:45 UT and on 2012 March 20 at 14:31 UT. The simulation reproduces the first and third eruption, with the simulated flux rope erupting roughly 1 and 10 hours before the observed ejections, respectively. A parameter study is conducted where the boundary and initial conditions are varied along with the physical effects of Ohmic diffusion, hyperdiffusion and an additional injection of helicity. When comparing the simulations, the evolution of the magnetic field, free magnetic energy, relative helicity and flux rope eruption timings do not change significantly. This indicates that the key element in reproducing the coronal evolution of AR 11437 is the use of line-of-sight magnetograms to drive the evolution of the coronal magnetic field.",physics,physics.space-ph,0
Non-Markovian dynamics of a microcavity coupled to a waveguide in photonic crystals,"In this paper, the non-Markovian dynamics of a microcavity coupled to a waveguide in photonic crystals is studied based on Fano-type tight binding model. Using the exact master equation, we solve analytically and numerically the temporal evolution of the cavity coherent state and the associated physical observables. A critical transition is revealed when the coupling increase between the cavity and the waveguide. In particular, the cavity field becomes dissipationless when the coupling strength goes beyond a critical value, as a manifestation of strong non-Markovian memory effect. The result also indicates that the cavity can maintain in a coherent state with arbitrary small number of photons when it strongly couples to the waveguide at very low temperature. These properties can be measured experimentally through the photon current flowing over the waveguide in photonic crystals.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Collective excitation branch in the continuum of pair-condensed Fermi gases : analytical study and scaling laws,"The pair-condensed unpolarized spin-$1/2$ Fermi gases have a collective excitation branch in their pair-breaking continuum (V.A. Andrianov, V.N. Popov, 1976). We study it at zero temperature, with the eigenenergy equation deduced from the linearized time-dependent BCS theory and extended analytically to the lower half complex plane through its branch cut, calculating both the dispersion relation and the spectral weights (quasiparticle residues) of the branch. In the case of BCS superconductors, so called because the effect of the ion lattice is replaced by a short-range electron-electron interaction, we also include the Coulomb interaction and we restrict ourselves to the weak coupling limit $\Delta/\mu\to 0^+$ ($\Delta$ is the order parameter, $\mu $ the chemical potential) and to wavenumbers $q=O(1/\xi)$ where $\xi$ is the size of a pair; when the complex energy $z_q$ is expressed in units of $\Delta$ and $q$ in units of $1/\xi$, the branch follows a universal law insensitive to the Coulomb interaction. In the case of cold atoms in the BEC-BCS crossover, only a contact interaction remains, but the coupling strength $\Delta/\mu$ can take arbitrary values, and we study the branch at any wave number. At weak coupling, we predict three scales, that already mentioned $q\approx 1/\xi$, that $q\approx(\Delta/\mu)^{-1/3}/\xi$ where the real part of the dispersion relation has a minimum and that $q\approx (\mu/\Delta)/\xi\approx k_{\rm F}$ ($k_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave number) where the branch reaches the edge of its existence domain. Near the point where the chemical potential vanishes on the BCS side, $\mu/\Delta\to 0^+$, where $\xi\approx k_{\rm F}$, we find two scales $q\approx(\mu/\Delta)^{1/2}/\xi$ and $q\approx 1/\xi$. In all cases, the branch has a limit $2\Delta$ and a quadratic start at $q=0$. These results were obtained for $\mu>0$, where the eigenenergy equation admits at least two branch points $\epsilon_a(q)$ and $\epsilon_b(q)$ on the positive real axis, and for an analytic continuation through the interval $[\epsilon_a(q),\epsilon_b(q)] $. We find new continuum branches by performing the analytic continuation through $[\epsilon_b(q),+\infty[$ or even, for $q$ low enough, where there is a third real positive branch point $\epsilon_c(q)$, through $[\epsilon_b(q),\epsilon_c(q)]$ and $[\epsilon_c(q),+\infty[$. On the BEC side $\mu<0$ not previously studied, where there is only one real positive branch point $ \epsilon_a(q)$, we also find new collective excitation branches under the branch cut $[\epsilon_a (q),+\infty[$. For $\mu>0$, some of these new branches have a low-wavenumber exotic hypoacoustic $z_q\approx q^{3/2}$ or hyperacoustic $z_q\approx q^{4/5}$ behavior. For $\mu<0$, we find a hyperacoustic branch and a nonhypoacoustic branch, with a limit $2\Delta$ and a purely real quadratic start at $q=0$ for $\Delta/|\mu|<0.222$.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,0
On a Conjecture of Givental,"These brief notes record our puzzles and findings surrounding Givental's recent conjecture which expresses higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants in terms of the genus-0 data.

We make some simple checks supporting his conjecture.",hep,hep-th,New physics in $b \to s e^+ e^-$?,"At present, the measurements of some observables in $B \to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$ and $B_s^0 \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays, and of $R_{K^{(*)}} \equiv {\cal B}(B \to K^{(*)} \mu^+ \mu^-)/{\cal B}(B \to K^{(*)} e^+ e^-)$, are in disagreement with the predictions of the standard model. While most of these discrepancies can be removed with the addition of new physics (NP) in $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$, a difference of $>\sim 1.7 \sigma$ still remains in the measurement of $R_{K^*}$ at small values of $q^2$, the dilepton invariant mass-squared. In the context of a global fit, this is not a problem. However, it does raise the question: if the true value of $R_{K^*}^{low}$ is near its measured value, what is required to explain it? In this paper, we show that, if one includes NP in $b \to s e^+ e^-$, one can generate values for $R_{K^*}^{low}$ that are within $\sim 1\sigma$ of its measured value. Using a model-independent, effective-field-theory approach, we construct many different possible NP scenarios. We also examine specific models containing leptoquarks or a $Z'$ gauge boson. Here, additional constraints from lepton-flavour-violating observables, $B_s^0$-${\bar B}_s^0$ mixing and neutrino trident production must be taken into account, but we still find a number of viable NP scenarios. For the various scenarios, we examine the predictions for $R_{K^{(*)}}$ in other $q^2$ bins, as well as for the observable $Q_5 \equiv P^{\prime\mu\mu}_5 -P^{\prime ee}_5$.",hep,hep-ph,0
"3.5 keV X-rays as the ""21 cm line"" of dark atoms, and a link to light sterile neutrinos","The recently discovered 3.5 keV X-ray line from extragalactic sources may be evidence of dark matter scatterings or decays. We show that dark atoms can be the source of the emission, through their hyperfine transitions, which would be the analog of 21 cm radiation from a dark sector. We identify two families of dark atom models that match the X-ray observations and are consistent with other constraints. In the first, the hyperfine excited state is long-lived compared to the age of the universe, and the dark atom mass is relatively unconstrained; dark atoms could be strongly self-interacting in this case. In the second, the excited state is short-lived and viable models are parameterized by the value of the dark proton-to-electron mass ratio $R$: for $R = 10^2-10^4$, the dark atom mass is predicted be in the range $350-1300$ GeV, with fine structure constant $\alpha'\cong 0.1-0.6$. In either class of models, the dark photon must be massive with $m_{\gamma'} \gtrsim$ 1 MeV and decay into $e^+ e^-$. Evidence for the model could come from direct detection of the dark atoms. In a natural extension of this framework, the dark photon could decay predominantly into invisible particles, for example $\sim 0.5$ eV sterile neutrinos, explaining the extra radiation degree of freedom recently suggested by data from BICEP2, while remaining compatible with BBN.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Phase Curves of Small Bodies from the SLOAN Moving Objects Catalog,"Extensive photometric surveys are and will continue producing massive amounts of data on small bodies. Usually, these data will be sparsely obtained at arbitrary (and unknown)rotational phases. Therefore, new methods to process such data need to be developed to make the most of those large catalogs. We aim to produce a method to create phase curves of small bodies considering the uncertainties introduced by the nominal errors in the magnitudes and the effect introduced by rotational variations. We use the SLOAN Moving Objects Catalog data as a benchmark to construct phase curves of all small bodies in there, in u', g', r', i', and z' filters. We will obtain from the phase curves the absolute magnitudes and set up with them the absolute colors, which are the colors of the asteroids not affected by changes in phase angle. We select objects with $\geq3$ observations taken in at least one filter and spanned over a minimum of 5 degrees in phase angle. We developed a method that combines Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference to estimate the absolute magnitudes using the HG$_{12}^*$ photometric system. We obtained almost 15\,000 phase curves, about 12,000 including all five filters. The absolute magnitudes and absolute colors are compatible with previously published data, supporting our method. The method we developed is fully automatic and well suited to be run on large amounts of data. Moreover, it includes the nominal uncertainties in the magnitudes and the whole distribution of possible rotational states of the objects producing, possibly, less precise values, i.e., larger uncertainties, but more accurate, i.e., closer to the actual value. To our knowledge, this work is the first to include the effect of rotational variations in such a manner.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,0
Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $SL(2)$ and their quantization,All possible graded Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $SL(2)$ are described. We prove that differential Poisson-Lie structures prolonging the Sklyanin brackets do not exist on $SL(2)$. There are two and only two graded Poisson-Lie structures on $SL (2)$ and neither of them can be obtained by a reduction of graded Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $GL(2)$. Both of them can be quantized and as a result we get a new graded algebra of quantum right-invariant forms on $SL_q(2)$ with three generators.,hep,hep-th,Towards symmetric discretization schemes via weak boundary conditions,"The Szymanzik improvement program for gauge theories is most commonly implemented using forward finite difference corrections to the Wilson action. Central symmetric schemes naively applied, suffer from a doubling of degrees of freedom, identical to the well known fermion doubling phenomenon. And while adding a complex Wilson term remedies the problem for fermions, it does not easily transfer to real-valued gauge fields. In this talk I report on recent progress in formulating symmetric discretization schemes for classical actions of simple one-dimensional problems. They avoid doubling by exploiting the weak imposition of initial/boundary conditions. Inspired by recent work in the field of numerical analysis of partial differential equations, I construct a regularized summation-by-parts finite difference operator using boundary data based on affine coordinates. Application to a classical initial value problems with second order derivatives are presented.",hep,hep-lat,0
Neural Networks Enforcing Physical Symmetries in Nonlinear Dynamical Lattices: The Case Example of the Ablowitz-Ladik Model,"In this work we introduce symmetry-preserving, physics-informed neural networks (S-PINNs) motivated by symmetries that are ubiquitous to solutions of nonlinear dynamical lattices. Although the use of PINNs have recently attracted much attention in data-driven discovery of solutions chiefly to partial differential equations, we demonstrate that they fail at enforcing important physical laws including symmetries of solutions and conservation laws. Through the correlation of parity symmetries in both space and time of solutions to differential equations with their group equivariant representation, we construct group-equivariant NNs which respect spatio-temporal parity symmetry. Moreover, we adapt the proposed architecture to enforce different types of periodicity (or localization) of solutions to nonlinear dynamical lattices. We do so by applying S-PINNs to the completely integrable Ablowitz-Ladik model, and performing numerical experiments with a special focus on waveforms that are related to rogue structures. These include the Kuznetsov-Ma soliton, and Akhmediev breather as well as the Peregrine soliton. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed architecture over standard PINNs.",nlin,nlin.PS,Elliptic-rogue waves and modulational instability in nonlinear soliton equations,"We present elliptic-rogue wave solutions for integrable nonlinear soliton equations in theta functions. Unlike solutions generated on the plane wave background, these solutions depict rogue waves emerging on elliptic function backgrounds. By refining the modified squared wave function method in tandem with the Darboux-B\""acklund transformation, we establish a quantitative correspondence between elliptic-rogue waves and the modulational instability. This connection reveals that the modulational instability of elliptic function solutions triggers rational-form solutions displaying elliptic-rogue waves, whereas the modulational stability of elliptic function solutions results in the rational-form solutions exhibiting the elliptic-solitons or elliptic-breathers. Moreover, this approach enables the derivation of higher-order elliptic-rogue waves, offering a versatile framework for constructing elliptic-rogue waves and exploring modulational stability in other integrable equations.",nlin,nlin.SI,0
Slurm: fluid particle-in-cell code for plasma modeling,"With the approach of exascale computing era, particle-based models are becoming the focus of research due to their excellent scalability. We present a new code, Slurm, which implements the classic particle-in-cell algorithm for modeling magnetized fluids and plasmas. It features particle volume evolution which damps the numerical finite grid instability, and allows modeling of key physical instabilities such as Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor. The magnetic field in Slurm is handled via the electromagnetic vector potential carried by particles. Numerical diffusion of the magnetic flux is extremely low, and the solenoidality of the magnetic field is preserved to machine precision. A double-linked list is used to carry particles, thus implementation of open boundary conditions is simple and efficient. The code is written in C++ with OpenMP multi-threading, and has no external dependencies except for Boost. It is easy to install and use on multi-core desktop computers as well as on large shared-memory machines. Slurm is an ideal tool for its primary goal, modeling of space weather events in the heliosphere. This article walks the reader through the physical model, the algorithm, and all important details of implementation. Ideally, after finishing this paper, the reader should be able to either use Slurm for solving the desired problem, or create a new fluid PIC code.",physics,physics.comp-ph,Stimulated Raman scattering in an optical parametric oscillator based on periodically poled MgO-doped stoichiometric LiTaO3,The evolution versus pump power of the spectrum of a singly resonant optical parametric oscillator based on an MgO-doped periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalate crystal is observed.

International Large Detector: Interim Design Report,"The ILD detector is proposed for an electron-positron collider with collision centre-of-mass energies from 90~\GeV~to about 1~\TeV. It has been developed over the last 10 years by an international team of scientists with the goal to design and eventually propose a fully integrated detector, primarily for the International Linear Collider, ILC. In this report the fundamental ideas and concepts behind the ILD detector are discussed and the technologies needed for the realisation of the detector are reviewed. The document starts with a short review of the science goals of the ILC, and how the goals can be achieved today with the detector technologies at hand.

The integration of the different sub-systems into an integrated detector is discussed, as is the interface between the detector and the collider. This is followed by a concise summary of the benchmarking which has been performed in order to find an optimal balance between performance and cost.

We observe that the sign problem becomes less severe as the temperature is increased. We also find the domain where the sign problem is maximal -- the average phase factor is zero, which is related to the pion condensation phase in the QCD with finite isospin chemical potential. We find that, in the matrix model we studied, the critical point is located inside the domain of the maximal sign problem, making the point inaccessible to conventional reweighting techniques.

Dynamics and Rheology of Ring-Linear Blend Semidilute Solutions in Extensional Flow: Modeling and Molecular Simulations,"We use Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations and single molecule experiments to investigate the influence of topological constraints and hydrodynamic interactions on the dynamics and rheology of solutions of ring-linear polymer blends at the overlap concentration. We find agreement between simulation and experiment in that rings in solution blends exhibit large conformational fluctuations, including extension overshoots in the startup of flow and tumbling and tank-treading at steady state. Ring polymer fluctuations increase with blend fraction of linear polymers and are peaked at a ring Weissenberg number $\textrm{Wi}_R \approx 1.5$. On the contrary, linear and ring polymers in pure solutions show a peak in fluctuations at the critical coil-stretch Weissenberg number $\textrm{Wi} = 0.5$. BD simulations show that extension overshoots on startup of flow are due to flow-induced intermolecular ring-linear polymer hooks, whereas fluctuations at steady state are dominated by intermolecular hydrodynamic interactions (HI). This is supported by simulations of bidisperse linear polymer solution blends, which show similar trends in conformational dynamics between rings and linear polymers with a matched contour length. Compared to BD simulations, single molecule experiments show quantitatively larger fluctuations, which could arise because experiments are performed on higher molecular weight polymers with stronger topological constraints. To this end, we have advanced the understanding of the effects of topological interactions and intermolecular HI on the dynamics of semidilute ring-linear polymer blend solutions.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,Low-Temperature Light Detectors: Neganov-Luke Amplification and Calibration,"The simultaneous measurement of phonons and scintillation light induced by incident particles in a scintillating crystal such as CaWO4 is a powerful technique for the active rejection of background induced by gamma's and beta's and even neutrons in direct Dark Matter searches. However, less than ~1% of the energy deposited in a CaWO4 crystal is detected as light. Thus, very sensitive light detectors are needed for an efficient event-by-event background discrimination. Due to the Neganov-Luke effect, the threshold of low-temperature light detectors based on semiconducting substrates can be improved significantly by drifting the photon-induced electron-hole pairs in an applied electric field. We present measurements with low-temperature light detectors based on this amplification mechanism. The Neganov-Luke effect makes it possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of our light detectors by a factor of ~9 corresponding to an energy threshold of ~21 eV.

To gain insight on the convergence dynamics, a stability analysis of spatially uniform states is performed, revealing the existence of a threshold for the discretization parameter which depends on the lattice parameters, below which their destabilization occurs and spatially non-uniform equilibrium states may emerge. Direct numerical simulations justified that the analytical stability criteria and parametric thresholds effectively describe the above transition dynamics and revealed the rich structure of the equilibrium set. Connections with the continuous sibling Lefever-Lejeune partial differential equation are also discussed.",nlin,nlin.PS,"A Gibbs-like measure for single-time, multi-scale energy transfer in stochastic signals and Shell Model of turbulence","A Gibbs-like approach for simultaneous multi-scale correlation functions in random, time-dependent, multiplicative processes for the turbulent energy cascade is investigated. We study the optimal log-normal Gibbs-like distribution able to describe the subtle effects induced by non-trivial time dependency on both single-scale (structure functions) and multi-scale correlation functions. We provide analytical expression for the general multi-scale correlation functions in terms of the two-point correlations between multipliers and we show that the log-normal distribution is already accurate enough to reproduce quantitatively many of the observed behavior. The main result is that non-trivial time effects renormalize the Gibbs-like effective potential necessary to describe single-time statistics. We also present a generalization of this approach to more general, non log-normal, potential. In the latter case one obtains a formal expansion of both structure functions and multi-scale correlations in terms of cumulants of all orders.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Local information sources received the most attention from Puerto Ricans during the aftermath of Hurricane Mar\'ia,"In September 2017, Hurricane Mar\'ia made landfall across the Caribbean region as a category 4 storm. In the aftermath, many residents of Puerto Rico were without power or clean running water for nearly a year. Using both English and Spanish tweets from September 16 to October 15 2017, we investigate discussion of Mar\'ia both on and off the island, constructing a proxy for the temporal network of communication between victims of the hurricane and others. We use information theoretic tools to compare the lexical divergence of different subgroups within the network. Lastly, we quantify temporal changes in user prominence throughout the event. We find at the global level that Spanish tweets more often contained messages of hope and a focus on those helping. At the local level, we find that information propagating among Puerto Ricans most often originated from sources local to the island, such as journalists and politicians. Critically, content from these accounts overshadows content from celebrities, global news networks, and the like for the large majority of the time period studied. Our findings reveal insight into ways social media campaigns could be deployed to disseminate relief information during similar events in the future.",physics,physics.soc-ph,The Quantum Field Theory on Which the Everyday World Supervenes,"Effective Field Theory (EFT) is the successful paradigm underlying modern theoretical physics, including the ""Core Theory"" of the Standard Model of particle physics plus Einstein's general relativity. I will argue that EFT grants us a unique insight: each EFT model comes with a built-in specification of its domain of applicability. Hence, once a model is tested within some domain (of energies and interaction strengths), we can be confident that it will continue to be accurate within that domain. Currently, the Core Theory has been tested in regimes that include all of the energy scales relevant to the physics of everyday life (biology, chemistry, technology, etc.). Therefore, we have reason to be confident that the laws of physics underlying the phenomena of everyday life are completely known.",physics,physics.hist-ph,0
Estimating the molecular gas mass of low-redshift galaxies from a combination of mid-infrared luminosity and optical properties,"We present CO(J=1-0) and/or CO(J=2-1) spectroscopy for 31 galaxies selected from the ongoing MaNGA survey, obtained with multiple telescopes. This sample is combined with CO observations from the literature to study the correlation of the CO luminosities ($L_{\rm CO(1-0)}$) with the mid-infrared luminosities at 12 ($L_{12 \mu m}$) and 22 $\mu$m ($L_{\rm 22 \mu m}$), as well as the dependence of the residuals on a variety of galaxy properties. The correlation with $L_{\rm 12 \mu m}$ is tighter and more linear, but galaxies with relatively low stellar masses and blue colors fall significantly below the mean $L_{\rm CO(1-0)}-L_{\rm 12\mu m}$ relation. We propose a new estimator of the CO(1-0) luminosity (and thus the total molecular gas mass) that is a linear combination of three parameters: $L_{\rm 12 \mu m}$, $M_\ast$ and $g-r$. We show that, with a scatter of only 0.18 dex in log $(L_{\rm CO(1-0)})$, this estimator provides unbiased estimates for galaxies of different properties and types. An immediate application of this estimator to a compiled sample of galaxies with only CO(J=2-1) observations yields a distribution of the CO(J=2-1) to CO(J=1-0) luminosity ratios ($R21$) that agrees well with the distribution of real observations, in terms of both the median and the shape. Application of our estimator to the current MaNGA sample reveals a gas-poor population of galaxies that are predominantly early-type and show no correlation between molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratio and star formation rate, in contrast to gas-rich galaxies. We also provide alternative estimators with similar scatters, based on $r$ and/or $z$ band luminosities instead of $M_\ast$. These estimators serve as cheap and convenient $M_{\rm mol}$ proxies to be potentially applied to large samples of galaxies, thus allowing statistical studies of gas-related processes of galaxies.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Spotting Radio Transients with the help of GPUs,"Exploration of the time-domain radio sky has huge potential for advancing our knowledge of the dynamic universe. Past surveys have discovered large numbers of pulsars, rotating radio transients and other transient radio phenomena; however, they have typically relied upon off-line processing to cope with the high data and processing rate. This paradigm rules out the possibility of obtaining high-resolution base-band dumps of significant events or of performing immediate follow-up observations, limiting analysis power to what can be gleaned from detection data alone. To overcome this limitation, real-time processing and detection of transient radio events is required. By exploiting the significant computing power of modern graphics processing units (GPUs), we are developing a transient-detection pipeline that runs in real-time on data from the Parkes radio telescope. In this paper we discuss the algorithms used in our pipeline, the details of their implementation on the GPU and the challenges posed by the presence of radio frequency interference.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,0
Statistical measures of complexity for strongly interacting systems,"In recent studies, new measures of complexity for nonlinear systems have been proposed based on probabilistic grounds, as the LMC measure (Phys. Lett. A {\bf 209} (1995) 321) or the SDL measure (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 59} (1999) 2). All these measures share an intuitive consideration: complexity seems to emerge in nature close to instability points, as for example the phase transition points characteristic of critical phenomena. Here we discuss these measures and their reliability for detecting complexity close to critical points in complex systems composed of many interacting units. Both a two-dimensional spatially extended problem (the 2D Ising model) and a $\infty$-dimensional (random graph) model (random Boolean networks) are analysed. It is shown that the LMC and the SDL measures can be easily generalized to extended systems but fails to detect real complexity.",nlin,nlin.AO,Secure Communication using Compound Signal from Generalized Synchronizable Chaotic Systems,"By considering generalized synchronizable chaotic systems, the drive-auxiliary system variables are combined suitably using encryption key functions to obtain a compound chaotic signal.

We apply this approach to transmit analog and digital information signals in which the quality of the recovered signal is higher and the encoding is more secure.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Baryon production and net-proton distributions in relativistic heavy ion collisions,The higher order moments of the net-baryon distributions in relativistic heavy ion collisions are useful probes for the QCD critical point and fluctuations. We study the net-proton distributions and their moments in a simple model which considers the baryon stopping and pair production effects in the processes. It is shown that a single emission source model can explain the experimental data well. Centrality and energy dependence of the distributions and higher moments is discussed.,nucl,nucl-ex,Manifestations of Isospin in Nearest Neighbor Spacing Distributions for the f-p Model Space,"The strong interactions are charge independent. If we limit ourselves to the strong interactions, we have the isospin $T$ as a good quantum number.

In particular, we study nucleons in the f-p model space for the nucleus $^{44}$Ti. We also study the effect of the Coulomb interaction on the level spacing distribution.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Origin of the springs of Costa Verde beach in Lima Peru,"This paper tries to determine the origin of springs on the Costa Verde beach, located in the district of Barranco, Miraflores and Magdalena, province of Lima, Peru. These springs emerge near the shoreline, from the lower layers of a 80 meter high cliff. They have survived the process of urbanization of agricultural land, started in the early 70, which decreased the water table aquifer of Lima, and wiped the water leaks from the cliffs. To identify the source of the springs, isotopic, physical, chemical and bacteriological analysis was carried out for samples from five springs. The isotopic concentrations in waters from Costa Verde springs are depleted compared to those obtained for Lima aquifer waters, which is recharged by infiltration of the Rimac River. The measured values of those concentrations suggest that water from the Costa Verde springs should come from a direct recharge in the upper and middle basin, due to infiltration of rainfall or the river at an altitude of about 3600 m. Conductivity and temperature, measured in situ, are similar to those obtained on Lima aquifers. The laboratory analysis showed no significant levels of total or fecal coliform, discarding possible leakage from Lima sewerage.",physics,physics.geo-ph,High-resolution ARPES endstation for in-situ electronic structure investigations at SSRF,"Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is one of the most powerful experimental techniques in condensed matter physics. Synchrotron ARPES, which uses photons with high flux and continuously tunable energy, has become particularly important. However, an excellent synchrotron ARPES system must have features such as a small beam spot, super-high energy resolution, and a user-friendly operation interface. A synchrotron beamline and an endstation (BL03U) were designed and constructed at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The beam spot size at the sample position is 7.5 (V) $\mu$m $\times$ 67 (H) $\mu$m, and the fundamental photon range is 7-165 eV; the ARPES system enables photoemission with an energy resolution of 2.67 meV@21.2 eV. In addition, the ARPES system of this endstation is equipped with a six-axis cryogenic sample manipulator (the lowest temperature is 7 K) and is integrated with an oxide molecular beam epitaxy system and a scanning tunneling microscope, which can provide an advanced platform for in-situ characterization of the fine electronic structure of condensed matter.",physics,physics.ins-det,0
Study of the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation for Mass-Scaling of Cold Collision Properties,"Asymptotic levels of the A $^1\Sigma_u^+$ state of the two isotopomers $^{39}{\rm K}_2$ and $^{39}{\rm K}^{41}{\rm K}$ up to the dissociation limit are investigated with a Doppler-free high resolution laser-spectroscopic experiment in a molecular beam. The observed level structure can be reproduced correctly only if a mass dependent correction term is introduced for the interaction potential. The applied relative correction in the depth of the potential is $10^{-6}$, which is in the order of magnitude expected for corrections of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. A similar change in ground state potentials might lead to significant changes of mass-scaled properties describing cold collisions like the s-wave scattering length.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,Mapping the energy surface of PbTiO3 in multidimensional electric-displacement space,"In recent years, methods have been developed that allow first-principles electronic-structure calculations to be carried out under conditions of fixed electric field. For some purposes, however, it is more convenient to work at fixed electric displacement field. Initial implementations of the fixed-displacement-field approach have been limited to constraining the field along one spatial dimension only. Here, we generalize this approach to treat the full three-dimensional displacement field as a constraint, and compute the internal-energy landscape as a function of this multidimensional displacement-field vector. Using PbTiO3 as a prototypical system, we identify stable or metastable tetragonal, orthorhombic and rhombohedral structures as the displacement field evolves along [001], [110] and [111] directions, respectively. The energy minimum along [001] is found to be deeper than that along [110] or [111], as expected for a system having a tetragonal ground state. The barriers connecting these minima are found to be quite small, consistent with the current understanding that the large piezoelectric effects in PbTiO3 arise from the easy rotation of the polarization vector.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,0
A new coupled computational method in conjunction with three-dimensional finite volume schemes for nonlinear coupled constitutive relations,"Non-equilibrium effects play a vital role in high-speed and rarefied gas flows and the accurate simulation of these flow regimes are far beyond the capability of near-local-equilibrium Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations. Eu proposed generalized hydrodynamic equations which are consistent with the laws of irreversible thermodynamics to solve this problem. Based on Eu's generalized hydrodynamics equations, a computational model, namely the nonlinear coupled constitutive relations(NCCR),was developed by R.S.Myong and applied successfully to one-dimensional shock wave structure and two-dimensional rarefied flows. In this paper, finite volume schemes, including LU-SGS time advance scheme, MUSCL interpolation and AUSMPW+ scheme, are fistly adopted to investigate NCCR model's validity and potential in three-dimensional complex hypersonic rarefied gas flows. Moreover, in order to solve the computational stability problems in 3D complex flows,a modified solution is developed for the NCCR model. Finally, the modified solution is tested for a slip complex flow over a 3D hollow cylinder-flare configuration. The numerical results show that the NCCR model by the modified solution yields good solutions in better agreement with the DSMC results and experimential data than NSF equations, and imply NCCR model's great potential capability in further application.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,Micromechanics analysis of thermal expansion and thermal pressurization of a hardened cement paste,The results of a macro-scale experimental study of the effect of heating on a fluid-saturated hardened cement paste are analysed using a multi-scale homogenization model. The analysis of the experimental results revealed that the thermal expansion coefficient of the cement paste pore fluid is anomalously higher than the one of pure bulk water. The micromechanics model is calibrated using the results of drained and undrained heating tests and permits the extrapolation of the experimentally evaluated thermal expansion and thermal pressurization parameters to cement pastes with different water-to-cement ratios. It permits also to calculate the pore volume thermal expansion coefficient f a which is difficult to evaluate experimentally. The anomalous pore fluid thermal expansion is also analysed using the micromechanics model.,physics,physics.class-ph,0
Investigation of two Fermi-LAT gamma-ray blazars coincident with high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube,"After the identification of the gamma-ray blazar TXS 0506+056 as the first compelling IceCube neutrino source candidate, we perform a systematic analysis of all high-energy neutrino events satisfying the IceCube realtime trigger criteria. We find one additional known gamma-ray source, the blazar GB6 J1040+0617, in spatial coincidence with a neutrino in this sample. The chance probability of this coincidence is 30% after trial correction. For the first time, we present a systematic study of the gamma-ray flux, spectral and optical variability, and multi-wavelength behavior of GB6 J1040+0617 and compare it to TXS 0506+056. We find that TXS 0506+056 shows strong flux variability in the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray band, being in an active state around the arrival of IceCube-170922A, but in a low state during the archival IceCube neutrino flare in 2014/15. In both cases the spectral shape is statistically compatible ($\leq 2\sigma$) with the average spectrum showing no indication of a significant relative increase of a high-energy component. While the association of GB6 J1040+0617 with the neutrino is consistent with background expectations, the source appears to be a plausible neutrino source candidate based on its energetics and multi-wavelength features, namely a bright optical flare and modestly increased gamma-ray activity. Finding one or two neutrinos originating from gamma-ray blazars in the given sample of high-energy neutrinos is consistent with previously derived limits of neutrino emission from gamma-ray blazars, indicating the sources of the majority of cosmic high-energy neutrinos remain unknown.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,A Puzzle Involving Galactic Bulge Microlensing Events,"We study a sample of 16 microlensed Galactic bulge main sequence turnoff region stars for which high dispersion spectra have been obtained with detailed abundance analyses.

Physics demands that this correlation, assuming it to be real, be the result of some sample bias. We suggest several possible explanations, but are forced to reject them all,and are left puzzled. To obtain a reliable metallicity distribution in the Galactic bulge based on microlensed dwarf stars it will be necessary to resolve this issue through the course of additional observations.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
Thermodynamics of rotating quantum matter in the virial expansion,"We characterize the high-temperature thermodynamics of rotating bosons and fermions in two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic trapping potentials. We begin by calculating analytically the conventional virial coefficients $b_n$ for all $n$ in the noninteracting case, as functions of the trapping and rotational frequencies. We also report on the virial coefficients for the angular momentum and associated moment of inertia. Using the bn coefficients, we analyze the deconfined limit (in which the angular frequency matches the trapping frequency) and derive explicitly the limiting form of the partition function, showing from the thermodynamic standpoint how both the 2D and 3D cases become effectively homogeneous 2D systems. To tackle the virial coefficients in the presence of weak interactions, we implement a coarse temporal lattice approximation and obtain virial coefficients up to third order.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Tunnel junctions on as-grown superconducting MgB2 thin films,"We demonstrate that good superconductor/insulator/normal-metal tunnel junctions can be fabricated on as-grown superconducting MgB2 thin films.

We address the question of the onset energy using a suitable mathematical framework of analytic continuation, which uses as input the phase of the form factor below the first inelastic threshold, known with great precision through the Fermi-Watson theorem from $\pi\pi$ elastic scattering, and the modulus measured from threshold up to 3 GeV by the BaBar Collaboration. The method leads to almost model-independent upper and lower bounds on the spacelike form factor. Further inclusion of the value of the charge radius and the experimental value at $-2.45 \gev^2$ measured at JLab considerably increases the strength of the bounds in the region $ Q^2 \lesssim 10 \gev^2$, excluding the onset of the asymptotic perturbative QCD regime for $Q^2< 7\gev^2$. We also compare the bounds with available experimental data and with several theoretical models proposed for the low and intermediate spacelike region.",hep,hep-ex,0

Small-scale Magnetic Flux Ropes in the First two Parker Solar Probe Encounters,"Small-scale magnetic flux ropes (SFRs) are a type of structures in the solar wind that possess helical magnetic field lines. In a recent report (Chen & Hu 2020), we presented the radial variations of the properties of SFR from 0.29 to 8 au using in situ measurements from the Helios, ACE/Wind, Ulysses, and Voyager spacecraft. With the launch of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), we extend our previous investigation further into the inner heliosphere. We apply a Grad-Shafranov-based algorithm to identify SFRs during the first two PSP encounters. We find that the number of SFRs detected near the Sun is much less than that at larger radial distances, where magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence may act as the local source to produce these structures. The prevalence of Alfvenic structures significantly suppresses the detection of SFRs at closer distances. We compare the SFR event list with other event identification methods, yielding a dozen well-matched events. The cross-section maps of two selected events confirm the cylindrical magnetic flux rope configuration.

The effect of electrostriction,"Biomembranes are thin capacitors with the unique feature of displaying phase transitions in a physiologically relevant regime. We investigate the voltage and lateral pressure dependence of their capacitance close to their chain melting transition. Since the gel and the fluid membrane have different area and thickness, the capacitance of the two membrane phases is different. In the presence of external fields, charges exert forces that can influence the state of the membrane, thereby influencing the transition temperature. This phenomenon is called electrostriction. We show that this effect allows us to introduce a capacitive susceptibility that assumes a maximum in the melting transition with an associated excess charge. As a consequence, there exist voltage regimes where a small change in voltage can lead to a large uptake of charge and a large capacitive current. Furthermore, we consider electromechanical behavior such as pressure-induced changes in capacitance, and the application of such concepts in biology.",physics,physics.bio-ph,0
Stability of Initial Glasma Fields,"A system of gluon fields produced in the earliest phase of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, which is called `glasma', can be described in terms of classical fields. Initially there are chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields along the collision axis. A linear stability analysis of these fields is performed, assuming that the fields are space-time uniform. We apply Milne coordinates and the gauge condition which are usually used in studies of glasma. The chromoelectric field is in the Abelian configuration with the corresponding potential linearly depending on coordinates but the chromomagnetic field is in the nonAbelian configuration generated by the potential of non-commuting components. The chromomagnetic field is found to be unstable and the growth rate of the unstable mode is derived. Our findings are critically debated and confronted with the numerical simulations by Romatschke and Venugopalan who found that the evolving glasma is unstable due to the Weibel instability well-known in electromagnetic plasma.",nucl,nucl-th,Helium halo nuclei from low-momentum interactions,"We present ground-state energies of helium halo nuclei based on chiral low-momentum interactions, using the hyperspherical-harmonics method for 6He and coupled-cluster theory for 8He, with correct asymptotics for the extended halo structure.",nucl,nucl-ex,0

Formation and structure of vortex lattices in a rotating double-well Bose-Einstein condensate,"We investigate the dynamics of vortex formation and the structure of vortex lattices in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined within a rotating double-well (DW) potential. The dynamical process is a formation process of ""ghost"" vortices, ""hidden"" vortices and ""visible"" vortices. The critical rotation frequency for the creation of visible vortex is indicated by a sudden jump in the angular momentum evolution and an inflexion in the energy evolution. Different visible vortex structures can be formed by ruling the rotation frequency. In particular, structural change of visible vortex patterns can be achieved by regulating the anisotropy parameter of the DW potential. This feature allows to flexibly control the distribution of angular momentum in macroscopic quantum systems and study the interplay among rotation, interparticle interaction and external potential in superfluids.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Effective hamiltonian approach for strongly correlated lattice models,"We review a recent approach for the simulation of many-body interacting systems based on an efficient generalization of the Lanczos method for Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. This technique allows to perform systematic corrections to a given variational wavefunction, that allow to estimate exact energies and correlation functions, whenever the starting variational wavefunction is a qualitatively correct description of the ground state. The stability of the variational wavefunction against possible phases, not described at the variational level can be tested by using the ''effective Hamiltonian'' approach. In fact Monte Carlo methods, such as the ''fixed node approximation'' and the ''generalized Lanczos technique'' (Phys. Rev. B 64,024512, 2001) allow to obtain exact ground state properties of an effective Hamiltonian, chosen to be as close as possible to the exact Hamiltonian, thus yielding the most reasonable estimates of correlation functions. We also describe a simplified one-parameter scheme that improve substantially the efficiency of the generalized Lanczos method. This is tested on the t-J model, with a special effort to obtain accurate pairing correlations, and provide a possible non-phonon mechanism for High temperature superconductivity.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,0
Approximate Universal Relations for Neutron Stars and Quark Stars,"Neutron stars and quark stars are ideal laboratories to study fundamental physics at supra nuclear densities and strong gravitational fields. Astrophysical observables, however, depend strongly on the star's internal structure, which is currently unknown due to uncertainties in the equation of state. Universal relations, however, exist among certain stellar observables that do not depend sensitively on the star's internal structure. One such set of relations is between the star's moment of inertia ($I$), its tidal Love number (Love) and its quadrupole moment ($Q$), the so-called I-Love-Q relations. Similar relations hold among the star's multipole moments, which resemble the well-known black hole no-hair theorems. Universal relations break degeneracies among astrophysical observables, leading to a variety of applications: (i) X-ray measurements of the nuclear matter equation of state, (ii) gravitational wave measurements of the intrinsic spin of inspiraling compact objects, and (iii) gravitational and astrophysical tests of General Relativity that are independent of the equation of state.

We obtain the first light curves and perform period analyses of two neglected eclipsing binaries GK Boo and AE For to reveal their basic physical properties. We performed both a period analysis of the times of the minima and a BVR light curve analysis. Many new times of minima for both the systems were derived and collected from the data obtained by automatic and robotic telescopes. This allowed us to study the long-term period changes in these systems for the first time. From the light curve analysis, we derived the first rough estimates of the physical properties of these systems. We find that the analyzed systems are somewhat similar to each other. Both contain low-mass components of similar types, both are close to the Sun, both have short orbital period, and both contain another low-mass companions on longer orbits of a few years. In the case of GK Boo, both components are probably of K3 spectral type, while the distant companion is probably a late M star. The light curve of GK Boo is asymmetric, which probably causes the shift in the secondary minima in the O-C diagram. System AE For comprises two K7 stars, and the third body is a possible brown dwarf with a minimal mass of only about 47 Jupiter Mass. We succeed in completing period and light curve analyses of both systems, although a more detailed spectroscopic analysis is needed to confirm the physical parameters of the components to a higher accuracy.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,0

Indeed, in the next decade, many revolutionary instruments will enable the derivation of positions and velocities of individual stars in the Milky Way and its satellites and will detect signals from a range of astrophysical sources in different portions of the electromagnetic and gravitational spectrum, with an unprecedented sensitivity. On the one hand, this wealth of data will allow us to address a number of long-standing open questions in star cluster studies; on the other hand, many unexpected properties of these systems will come to light, stimulating further progress of our understanding of their formation and evolution.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Cosmic rays in astrospheres,"Cosmic rays passing through large astrospheres can be efficiently cooled inside these ""cavities"" in the interstellar medium. Moreover, the energy spectra of these energetic particles are already modulated in front of the astrospherical bow shocks. We study the cosmic ray flux in and around lambda Cephei as an example for an astrosphere. The large-scale plasma flow is modeled hydrodynamically with radiative cooling. We studied the cosmic ray flux in a stellar wind cavity using a transport model based on stochastic differential equations. The required parameters, most importantly, the elements of the diffusion tensor, are based on the heliospheric parameters. The magnetic field required for the diffusion coefficients is calculated kinematically. We discuss the transport in an astrospheric scenario with varying parameters for the transport coefficients. We show that large stellar wind cavities can act as sinks for the galactic cosmic ray flux and thus can give rise to small-scale anisotropies in the direction to the observer. Small-scale cosmic ray anisotropies can naturally be explained by the modulation of cosmic ray spectra in huge stellar wind cavities.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,0
Cutoff effects of heavy quark vacuum polarization at one-loop order,The charm-quark mass is typically not so far from the cutoff 1/a in lattice simulations. Its determinant may then potentially introduce large cutoff effects. We choose the O(a)-improved Wilson formulation and compute the vacuum polarization effects in two rather different observables at one-loop order. One is the quark-antiquark static force and the other the Schroedinger functional coupling; in addition we investigate two more quantities resulting from the latter. In all the cases the lattice artifacts due to the charm-quark are small when compared to the gluonic effects. This indicates that the inclusion of charm-quarks in dynamical fermion simulations is typically not a problem.,hep,hep-lat,Singularities of plane gravitational waves and their memory effects,"Similar to the Schwarzschild coordinates for spherical black holes, the Baldwin, Jeffery and Rosen (BJR) coordinates for plane gravitational waves are often singular, and extensions beyond such singularities are necessary, before studying asymptotic properties of such spacetimes at the null infinity of the plane, on which the gravitational waves propagate. The latter is closely related to the studies of memory effects and soft graviton theorems. In this paper, we point out that in the BJR coordinates all the spacetimes are singular physically at the focused point $u = u_s$, except for the two cases: (1) $\alpha =1/2, \; \forall \; \chi_n$; and (2) $\alpha =1, \; \chi_i = 0\; (i = 1, 2, 3)$, where $\chi_n$ are the coefficients in the expansion $\chi \equiv \left[{\mbox{det}}\left(g_{ab}\right) \right]^{1/4} = \left(u - u_s\right)^{\alpha}\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\chi_n \left(u - u_s\right)^n$ with $\chi_0 \not= 0$, the constant $\alpha \in (0, 1]$ characterizes the strength of the singularities, and $g_{ab}$ denotes the reduced metric on the two-dimensional plane orthogonal to the propagation direction of the wave. Therefore, the hypersurfaces $u= u_s$ already represent the boundaries of such spacetimes, and the null infinity does not belong to them. As a result, they cannot be used to study properties of plane gravitational waves at null infinities, including memory effects and soft graviton theorems.",hep,hep-th,0
Dual conformal invariance in the Regge limit,"A dual conformal symmetry, analogous to the dual conformal symmetry observed for the scattering amplitudes of N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory, is identified in the Regge limit of QCD. Combined with the original two-dimensional conformal symmetry of the theory, this dual symmetry can potentially explain the integrability of the BFKL Hamiltonian. We also give evidence that the symmetry survives when a subset of unitarity corrections are taken into account by studying briefly the non-planar 2 to m reggeon transition vertices.",hep,hep-th,Coexistence of CP eigenstates in Higgs boson decay,"The supersymmetric extension of the standard model contains an intrinsic sourceof CP violation mediated by the charginos. As an effect, both CP-even and CP-odd final states could be observed in the Higgs boson decay into two photons whose evidences were reported recently.",hep,hep-ph,0
Multi-step Steady-State Measurements of Low Permeability Using Series Circuit with A Reference Rock Sample,"A multi-step steady-state (MSSS) method is proposed here for the measurement of low permeability. This new method can accurately and easily measure very low permeabilities of rock samples using a new setup, where the targeted rock sample and ordinary apparatus components are connected with a reference rock sample to form a series circuit. Any conventional rock sample with high permeability could be used as a reference rock sample such that the traditional steady-state measurement is feasible to accurately determine its permeability as a reference value in the MSSS method. The challenging measurement of tiny mass flux rate by advanced pump system is avoided and the permeability of targeted rock sample can be directly computed using the pressure drops, sectional areas and lengths of the two connected rock samples, and the known permeability of the reference rock sample, based on the mass conservation principle in a series circuit at steady state. Multi-step measurements using additional reference rock samples will be needed if the pressure drop across the first reference rock sample is too small to be accurately measured due to high permeability ratio when it is connected with the targeted rock sample to form a series circuit. The relative pressure drops can be small since the measurement of flow speed is unnecessary, which improves the accuracy in studying the dependence of gas permeability on the pore pressure. Consequently, the advantages of the MSSS method include low expense, simplicity, high accuracy and efficiency.",physics,physics.geo-ph,Modeling of Atmospheric Flow Around a Coastal Cape: Lee Side Story,"The current research focuses on mesoscale dynamics of the atmospheric circulation around an idealized coastal cape representing typical summertime circulation along the northwest coast of the U.S., studied using a mesoscale coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling system. The orographic wind maximum features a strong NW flow extending a few hundred kilometers downstream and seaward of the cape, which closely follows mesoscale orographic low pressure developed in the lee of the cape. Both wind maximum and the lee trough experience a pronounced diurnal cycle, marked by maximum northwest flow and minimum pressure in the local evening hours (its opposite phase during morning hours), and confirmed by observations from limited buoy and coastal stations. Vertical structure of the atmospheric boundary layer over the coastal ocean on the lee side of the cape indicated the downward propagation of potential temperature and wind features during the course of the day, as opposed to the traditional surface-driven development of the atmospheric boundary layer. Momentum analysis showed the local pressure gradients near the surface vary greatly depending on the relative location about the cape. Strong perturbations in relative vorticity downwind of the cape supported the hypothesis that mountain dynamics have a key role in establishing wind regime around the cape. The sensitivity studies indicated the importance of coastal terrain elevation on the formation and the strength of the lee trough and wind maximum. Higher coastal topography was found to cause greater separation of the upwelling front (jet) from the coast downwind of the cape.",physics,physics.ao-ph,0
Characterising encapsulated nuclear waste using cosmic-ray muon tomography,"Tomographic imaging techniques using the Coulomb scattering of cosmic-ray muons have been shown previously to successfully identify and characterise low- and high-Z materials within an air matrix using a prototype scintillating-fibre tracker system. Those studies were performed as the first in a series to assess the feasibility of this technology and image reconstruction techniques in characterising the potential high-Z contents of legacy nuclear waste containers for the UK Nuclear Industry. The present work continues the feasibility study and presents the first images reconstructed from experimental data collected using this small-scale prototype system of low- and high-Z materials encapsulated within a concrete-filled stainless-steel container. Clear discrimination is observed between the thick steel casing, the concrete matrix and the sample materials assayed. These reconstructed objects are presented and discussed in detail alongside the implications for future industrial scenarios.",nucl,nucl-ex,The nature of the Lambda(1405) resonance in chiral dynamics,"The Lambda(1405) baryon resonance plays an outstanding role in various aspects in hadron and nuclear physics. It has been considered that the Lambda(1405) resonance is generated by the attractive interaction of the antikaon and the nucleon, as a quasi-bound state below the threshold decaying into the pi Sigma channel. Thus, the structure of Lambda(1405) is closely related to the Kbar N interaction which is the fundamental ingredient to study few-body systems with antikaon. In this paper, after reviewing the basic properties of the Lambda(1405) resonance, we introduce the dynamical coupled-channel model which respects chiral symmetry of QCD and the unitarity of the scattering amplitude. We show that the structure of the Lambda(1405) resonance is dominated by the meson-baryon molecule component and is described as a superposition of two independent states. The meson-baryon nature of Lambda(1405) leads to various hadronic molecule states in few-body systems with strangeness which are hadron composite systems driven by the hadronic interactions. We summarize the recent progress in the investigation of the Lambda(1405) structure and future perspective of the physics of the Lambda(1405) resonance.",nucl,nucl-th,0
"Energy spectra for protons emitted in the reaction Ca-nat(n, xp) at 94 MeV","The MEDLEY setup based at The Svedberg Laboratory (TSL), Uppsala, Sweden has previously been used to measure double-differential cross-sections for elastic nd scattering, as well as light ion production reactions for various nuclei in the interaction with neutrons around 95 MeV. When moved to the new beam line, the first experimental campaign was on light-ion production from Ca at 94 MeV in February 2005. These data sets have been analyzed for proton production in forward and backward angles. The Delta E - Delta E - E technique have been used to identify protons, and a cutoff as low as 2.5 MeV is achieved. Suppression of events induced by neutrons in the low-energy tail of the neutron field is achieved by time-of-flight techniques. The data are normalized relative to elastic np scattering measured in the 20-degree telescope. Results from an accepted neutron spectrum are presented and some methods to correct for events from low energy neutrons are presented and evaluated. The data are compared with calculations using the nuclear code TALYS. It was found that TALYS systematically overestimates the compound part, and underestimates the pre-equilibrium part of the cross-section.",nucl,nucl-ex,Towards a universal description of hadronic phase of QCD,"Mean-field model quantum field theories of hadrons were traditionally developed to describe cold and dense nuclear matter and are by now very well constrained from the recent neutron star merger observations. We show that when augmented with additional known hadrons and resonances but not included earlier, these mean-field models can be extended beyond its regime of applicability. Calculating some specific ratios of baryon number susceptibilities for finite temperature and moderate values of baryon densities within mean-field approximation, we show that these match consistently with the lattice QCD data available at lower densities, unlike the results obtained from a non-interacting hadron resonance gas model. We also estimate the curvature of the line of constant energy density, fixed at its corresponding value at the chiral crossover transition in QCD, in the temperature-density plane. The number density at low temperatures and high density is found to be about twice the nuclear saturation density along the line of constant energy density of $\epsilon=348 \pm 41$ MeV/$\text{fm}^3$. Moreover from this line we can indirectly constrain the critical end-point of QCD to be beyond $\mu_B=596$ MeV for temperature $\sim 125 $ MeV.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Post trimming of silicon photonics microresonators by nanoscale flash memory technology,"Flash memory technology is widely common in modern microelectronics, and is essentially affecting our daily life. Considering the recent progress in photonic circuitry, and in particular silicon photonics circuitry, there is now an opportunity to embed the flash memory technology in photonic applications. A particularly promising candidate that can benefit from such integration is the photonic resonator. As of today, chip scale resonators are essential building blocks in modern silicon photonic platform. However, their properties, and in particular their resonance frequencies deviate from their designed values due to unavoidable fabrication imperfections, imposing a stringent limitation on the applicability of such devices. Here we present a solution for this major obstacle and demonstrate electrical approach for post trimming of such resonators. This is achieved by integrating the well-established flash memory technology into the photonic circuitry. More specifically, we use the nanoscale Silicon-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon (SONOS) structure in order to trap charges in the thin silicon nitride layer, which is located in close proximity to the silicon device layer. This enables the accumulation of charges in the silicon, modifying the effective index of the optical mode and consequently the resonance frequency. By doing so, we provide a robust and elegant CMOS compatible memory solution, which can be easily manufactured and commercialized. We expect such an approach to pave the way for even more efficient utilization of resonators and interferometers in chip scale photonic and electro optic systems, with wide range of applications such as filters, modulators, sensors, and lasers, to name a few.",physics,physics.app-ph,Design and Performance of the GERDA Low-Background Cryostat for Operation in Water,In searching for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{76}$Ge the GERmanium Detector Array (GERDA) experiment at the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso has achieved an unprecedented low background of well below 10$^{-3}$ cts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$yr) in the region of interest. It has taken advantage of the first realization of a novel shielding concept based on a large cryostat filled with a liquid noble gas that is immersed in a water tank. The germanium detectors are operated without encapsulation in liquid argon. Argon and water shield the environmental background from the laboratory and the cryostat construction materials to a negligible level. The same approach has been adopted in the meantime by various experiments. This paper provides an overview of the design and operating experience of the 64 m$^3$ liquid argon cryostat and its associated infrastructure. The discussion includes the challenging safety issues associated with the operation of a large cryostat in a water tank.,physics,physics.ins-det,0
Magnetic field dependence of the neutral pion longitudinal screening mass in the linear sigma model with quarks,"We use the Linear Sigma Model with quarks to study the magnetic field-induced modifications on the longitudinal screening mass for the neutral pion at one-loop level. The effects of the magnetic field are introduced into the self-energy which contains the contributions from all the model particles. We find that to obtain a reasonable description for the behavior with the field strength, the magnetic field dependence of the particle masses need to be accounted for. We also find that the couplings need to decrease fast enough with the field strength to then reach constant and smaller values as compared to their vacuum ones. The results illustrate the need to treat the magnetic corrections to the particle masses and couplings in a self-consistent manner, accounting for the back reaction of the field effects for the magnetic field dependence of the rest of the particle species and couplings in the model.",hep,hep-lat,N=2 and N=4 Supersymmetric mKdV and sinh-Gordon Hierarchies,Integrable models with higher N=2 and N=4 supersymmetries are formulated on reductions of twisted loop superalgebras $\hat{sl}(2|2)$ and $\hat{sl}(4|4) $ endowed with principal gradation. In case of the $\hat{sl}(4|4)$ loop algebra a sequence of progressing reductions leads both to the N=4 and N=2 supersymmetric mKdV and sinh-Gordon equations. The reduction scheme is induced by twisted automorphism and allows via dressing approach to associate to each symmetry flow of half-integer degree a supersymmetry transformation involving only local expressions in terms of the underlying fields.,hep,hep-th,0
Enhancement of hyperon production at central rapidity in 158 A GeV/c Pb-Pb collisions,"Results are presented on hyperon and antihyperon production in Pb-Pb, pPb and pBe collisions at 158 GeV/c per nucleon. Lambda, Xi and Omega yields have been measured at central rapidity and medium transverse momentum as functions of the centrality of the collision. Comparing the yields in Pb-Pb to those in pBe interactions, strangeness enhancement is observed. The enhancement increases with the centrality and with the strangeness content of the hyperons, reaching a factor of about 20 for the Omega in the central Pb-Pb collisions.",nucl,nucl-ex,Algebraic Model for scattering in three-s-cluster systems. I. Theoretical Background,"A framework to calculate two-particle matrix elements for fully antisymmetrized three-cluster configurations is presented. The theory is developed for a scattering situation described in terms of the Algebraic Model. This means that the nuclear many-particle state and its asymptotic behaviour are expanded in terms of oscillator states of the intra-cluster coordinates. The Generating Function technique is used to optimize the calculation of matrix elements. In order to derive the dynamical equations, a multichannel version of the Algebraic Model is presented.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Two-scale localization of wave functions in disordered wires in a weak magnetic field,"Using the supersymmetry technique combined with the transfer matrix method we calculate different physical quantities characterizing localization in disordered wires. In particular, we analyze the density-density correlation function and study effects of an external magnetic field $H$ on tails of wave functions. At zero and very strong magnetic fields, we obtain explicit expressions, valid at arbitrary distances, for all moments and for the entire distribution function of the density-density correlations. A two-scale decay is shown to be a typical feature of infinitely long wires at weak magnetic fields: The far tail of the wave functions decays twice as slow as their main body. Extending Mott's physical picture for the localized states we present a qualitative description of the crossover in the magnetic field. Our arguments can be used for any dimensionality indicating that the concept of the two-scale localization in a weak magnetic field is a general feature of localization. The effect is very sensitive to a level smearing and cannot be seen in the transmittance of a system with metallic leads. This means that the Borland conjecture may not be used for a numerical check of the two-scale localization.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,Transport of Hubbard-Band Quasiparticles in Disordered Optical Lattices,"Quantum degenerate gases trapped in optical lattices are ideal testbeds for fundamental physics because these systems are tunable, well characterized, and isolated from the environment. Controlled disorder can be introduced to explore suppression of quantum diffusion in the absence of conventional dephasing mechanisms such as phonons, which are unavoidable in experiments on electronic solids. Recent experiments use transport of degenerate Fermi gases in optical lattices (Kondov et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 083002 (2015)) to probe a particularly extreme regime of strong interaction in what can be modeled as an Anderson-Hubbard model. These experiments find evidence for an intriguing insulating phase where quantum diffusion is completely suppressed by strong disorder. Quantitative interpretation of these experiments remains an open problem that requires inclusion of non-zero entropy, strong interaction, and trapping. We argue that the suppression of transport can be thought of as localization of Hubbard-band quasiparticles. We construct a theory of transport of Hubbard-band quasiparticles tailored to trapped optical lattice experiments. We compare the theory directly with center-of-mass transport experiments of Kondov et al. with no fitting parameters. The close agreement between theory and experiments shows that the suppression of transport is only partly due to finite entropy effects. We argue that the complete suppression of transport is consistent with Anderson localization of Hubbard-band quasiparticles. The combination of our theoretical framework and optical lattice experiments offers an important platform for studying localization in isolated many-body quantum systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,0
Resolving the spurious-state problem in the Dirac equation with finite difference method,"To solve the Dirac equation with the finite difference method, one has to face up to the spurious-state problem due to the fermion doubling problem when using the conventional central difference formula to calculate the first-order derivative on the equal interval lattices. This problem is resolved by replacing the central difference formula with the asymmetric difference formula, i.e., the backward or forward difference formula. To guarantee the hermitian of the Hamiltonian matrix, the backward and forward difference formula should be used alternatively according to the parity of the wavefunction. This provides a simple and efficient numerical prescription to solve various relativistic problems in the microscopic world.",nucl,nucl-th,Properties and significance of the surface dipole mode,"A strong isoscalar dipole resonance is known to be excited in a variety of nuclei, including isospin symmetric ones, at approximately 6-7 MeV. A series of theoretical studies and accumulating experimental evidence support an interpretation of the above dipole resonance as an elementary surface vibration. Obviously, such a mode is potentially as interesting as any collective excitation for a variety of reasons. In addition, though, it is found to account for the observed isoscalar segment of pygmy dipole strength. As discussed here, this has important implications for pygmy-strength interpretations and searches for genuine neutron-skin oscillations.",nucl,nucl-ex,0
Small-$x$ Asymptotics of the Gluon Helicity Distribution,"We determine the small-$x$ asymptotics of the gluon helicity distribution in a proton at leading order in perturbative QCD at large $N_c$. To achieve this, we begin by evaluating the dipole gluon helicity TMD at small $x$. In the process we obtain an interesting new result: in contrast to the unpolarized dipole gluon TMD case, the operator governing the small-$x$ behavior of the dipole gluon helicity TMD is different from the operator corresponding to the polarized dipole scattering amplitude (used in our previous work to determine the small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark helicity distribution). We then construct and solve novel small-$x$ large-$N_c$ evolution equations for the operator related to the dipole gluon helicity TMD. Our main result is the small-$x$ asymptotics for the gluon helicity distribution: $\Delta G \sim \left( \tfrac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h^G}$ with $\alpha_h^G = \tfrac{13}{4 \sqrt{3}} \, \sqrt{\tfrac{\alpha_s \, N_c}{2 \pi}} \approx 1.88 \, \sqrt{\tfrac{\alpha_s \, N_c}{2 \pi}}$. We note that the power $\alpha_h^G$ is approximately 20$\%$ lower than the corresponding power $\alpha_h^q$ for the small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark helicity distribution defined by $\Delta q \sim \left( \tfrac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h^q}$ with $\alpha_h^q = \tfrac{4}{\sqrt{3}} \, \sqrt{\tfrac{\alpha_s \, N_c}{2 \pi}} \approx 2.31 \, \sqrt{\tfrac{\alpha_s \, N_c}{2 \pi}}$ found in our earlier work.",nucl,nucl-ex,S-shell $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei based on chiral interactions,"We generalize the Jacobi no-core shell model (J-NCSM) to study double-strangeness hypernuclei. All particle conversions in the strangeness $S=-1,-2$ sectors are explicitly taken into account. In two-body space, such transitions may lead to the coupling between states of identical particles and of non-identical ones. Therefore, a careful consideration is required when determining the combinatorial factors that connect the many-body potential matrix elements and the free-space two-body potentials. Using second quantization, we systematically derive the combinatorial factors in question for $S=0,-1,-2$ sectors. As a first application, we use the J-NCSM to investigate $\Lambda \Lambda$ s-shell hypernuclei based on hyperon-hyperon (YY) potentials derived within chiral effective field theory at leading order (LO) and up to next-to-leading order (NLO). We find that the LO potential overbinds $^{\text{ }\text{ }\text{ } \text{}6}_{\Lambda \Lambda}\text{He}$ while the prediction of the NLO interaction is close to experiment.

"Pits, Uplifts and Small Chaos Features on Europa: Morphologic and Morphometric Evidence for Intrusive Upwelling and Lower Limits to Ice Shell Thickness","One of the clearest but unresolved questions for Europa is the thickness of its icy shell. Europa's surface is resplendent with geological features that bear on this question, and ultimately on its interior, geological history, and astrobiological potential. We characterize the size and topographic expression of circular and subcircular features created by endogenic thermal and tectonic disturbances on Europa: pits, uplifts, and small, subcircular chaos. We utilize the medium-resolution Galileo regional maps (RegMaps), as well as high-resolution regions, digital elevation models derived from albedo-controlled photoclinometry, and in some cases stereo-controlled photoclinometry. While limited in extent, the high-resolution images are extremely valuable for detecting smaller features and for overall geomorphological analysis. A peak in the size-distribution for all features is found at ~5-6 km in diameter and no pits smaller than 3.3 km in diameter were found in high resolution images. Additionally, there is a trend for larger pits to be deeper, and larger uplifts to be higher. Our data support a diapiric or intracrustal sill interpretation (as opposed to purely non-intrusive, melt-through models) and place a lower limit on ice shell thickness at the time of feature formation of 3-to-8 km, assuming isostasy and depending on the composition of the ice and underlying ocean.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,$Profiler$ - A Fast and Versatile New Program for Decomposing Galaxy Light Profiles,"I introduce $Profiler$, a new, user-friendly program written in $Python$ and designed to analyse the radial surface brightness profiles of galaxies. With an intuitive graphical user interface, $Profiler$ can accurately model a wide range of galaxies and galaxy components, such as elliptical galaxies, the bulges of spiral and lenticular galaxies, nuclear sources, discs, bars, rings, spiral arms, etc., with a variety of parametric functions routinely employed in the field (S\'ersic, core-S\'ersic, exponential, Gaussian, Moffat and Ferrers). In addition to these, $Profiler$ can employ the broken exponential model (relevant for disc truncations or antitruncations) and two special cases of the edge-on disc model: namely along the major axis (in the disc plane) and along the minor axis (perpendicular to the disc plane). $Profiler$ is optimised to work with galaxy light profiles obtained from isophotal measurements which capture radial gradients in the ellipticity, position angle and Fourier harmonic profiles of the isophotes, and are thus often better at capturing the total light than two-dimensional image-fitting programs. Additionally, the one-dimensional approach is generally less computationally expensive and more stable. In $Profiler$, the convolution of either circular or elliptical models with the point spread function is performed in two-dimensions, and offers a choice between Gaussian, Moffat or a user-provided data vector (a table of intensity values as a function of radius) for the point spread function. I demonstrate $Profiler$'s features and operation by decomposing three case-study galaxies: the cored elliptical galaxy NGC 3348, the nucleated dwarf Seyfert I galaxy Pox 52, and NGC 2549, a structurally complex, double-barred galaxy which also displays a Type II truncated disc viewed edge-on. $Profiler$ is freely available at: https://github.com/BogdanCiambur/PROFILER",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
The relativistic Doppler effect: when a zero frequency shift or a red shift exists for sources approaching the observer,"It is shown without making use of Lorentz transformation that there exists a phenomenon of relativistic zero-frequency shift in Doppler effect for a plane wave in free space, observed in two inertial frames of relative motion, and the zero shift takes place at a maximum aberration of light. When it is applied to analysis of a moving point light source, two unconventional physical implications result: (1) a light source, when it is approaching (moving closer to) the observer, may cause a red shift; (2) a zero-frequency-shift observation does not necessarily mean that the light source is not moving closer, and in contrast, the light source may be moving closer to the observer at a high speed.

Recent Advances in Two-Dimensional Metal Monochalcogenides,"The family of emerging low-symmetry and structural in-plane anisotropic 2D materials have been expanding rapidly in recent years. As an important emerging anisotropic 2D material, the black phosphorene (BP) analog group IVA-VI metal monochalcogenides (MMCs) have been surged recently due to their distinctive crystalline symmetries, exotic in-plane anisotropic electronic and optical response, earth abundant and environmentally friendly characteristics.

This feature results in peculiar non-hydrogenic excitonic states, in which exciton-mediated optical nonlinearities are predicted to be enhanced as compared to their hydrogenic counterpart. To demonstrate this enhancement, we performed optical transmission spectroscopy of a MoSe$_2$ monolayer placed in the strong coupling regime with the mode of an optical microcavity, and analyzed the results quantitatively with a nonlinear input-output theory. We find an enhancement of both the exciton-exciton interaction and of the excitonic fermionic saturation with respect to realistic values expected in the hydrogenic picture. Such results demonstrate that unconventional excitons in MoSe$_2$ are highly favourable for the implementation of large exciton-mediated optical nonlinearities, potentially working up to room temperature.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,0

Studies of parton distributions at a neutrino factory,"The determination of parton distribution functions in the nucleon and nuclei is important for obtaining precise hadron-reaction cross sections, from which any new exotic signature could be found. We show that a future neutrino factory could provide important information on the parton distributions. First, a recent effort concerning the parametrization of nuclear parton distributions is explained. It suggests that the factory should be important for determining unknown behavior of valence-quark distributions in nuclei at small $x$. Second, the facility could be used for understanding nucleon spin structure and isospin violation in the parton distributions.",nucl,nucl-th,Measurements of the ion fraction and mobility of alpha and beta decay products in liquid xenon using EXO-200,"Alpha decays in the EXO-200 detector are used to measure the fraction of charged $^{218}\mathrm{Po}$ and $^{214}\mathrm{Bi}$ daughters created from alpha and beta decays, respectively. $^{222}\mathrm{Rn}$ alpha decays in liquid xenon (LXe) are found to produce $^{218}\mathrm{Po}^{+}$ ions $50.3 \pm 3.0\%$ of the time, while the remainder of the $^{218}\mathrm{Po}$ atoms are neutral. The fraction of $^{214}\mathrm{Bi}^{+}$ from $^{214}\mathrm{Pb}$ beta decays in LXe is found to be $76.4 \pm 5.7\%$, inferred from the relative rates of $^{218}\mathrm{Po}$ and $^{214}\mathrm{Po}$ alpha decays in the LXe. The average velocity of $^{218}\mathrm{Po}$ ions is observed to decrease for longer drift times. Initially the ions have a mobility of $0.390 \pm 0.006~\mathrm{cm}^2/(\mathrm{kV}~\mathrm{s})$, and at long drift times the mobility is $0.219 \pm 0.004~\mathrm{cm}^2/(\mathrm{kV}~\mathrm{s})$. Time constants associated with the change in mobility during drift of the $^{218}\mathrm{Po}^{+}$ ions are found to be proportional to the electron lifetime in the LXe.",nucl,nucl-ex,0
Hypergraphs and City Street Networks,The map of a city's streets constitutes a particular case of spatial complex network. However a city is not limited to its topology: it is above all a geometrical object whose particularity is to organize into short and long axes called streets. In this article we present and discuss two algorithms aiming at recovering the notion of street from a graph representation of a city. Then we show that the length of the so-called streets scales logarithmically. This phenomenon leads to assume that a city is shaped into a logic of extension and division of space.,physics,physics.soc-ph,Data-Driven Equation Discovery of a Cloud Cover Parameterization,"A promising method for improving the representation of clouds in climate models, and hence climate projections, is to develop machine learning-based parameterizations using output from global storm-resolving models. While neural networks can achieve state-of-the-art performance within their training distribution, they can make unreliable predictions outside of it. Additionally, they often require post-hoc tools for interpretation. To avoid these limitations, we combine symbolic regression, sequential feature selection, and physical constraints in a hierarchical modeling framework. This framework allows us to discover new equations diagnosing cloud cover from coarse-grained variables of global storm-resolving model simulations. These analytical equations are interpretable by construction and easily transferable to other grids or climate models. Our best equation balances performance and complexity, achieving a performance comparable to that of neural networks ($R^2=0.94$) while remaining simple (with only 11 trainable parameters). It reproduces cloud cover distributions more accurately than the Xu-Randall scheme across all cloud regimes (Hellinger distances $<0.09$), and matches neural networks in condensate-rich regimes. When applied and fine-tuned to the ERA5 reanalysis, the equation exhibits superior transferability to new data compared to all other optimal cloud cover schemes. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of symbolic regression in discovering interpretable, physically-consistent, and nonlinear equations to parameterize cloud cover.",physics,physics.ao-ph,0
Large N Quantum Gravity,"We obtain the effective action of four dimensional quantum gravity, induced by N massless matter fields, by integrating the RG flow of the relative effective average action. By considering the leading approximation in the large N limit, where one neglects the gravitational contributions with respect to the matter contributions, we show how different aspects of quantum gravity, as asymptotic safety, quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential and the conformal anomaly induced effective action, are all represented by different terms of the effective action when this is expanded in powers of the curvature.",hep,hep-th,"Dark Matter ""Collider"" from Inelastic Boosted Dark Matter","We propose a novel dark matter (DM) detection strategy for the models with non-minimal dark sector. The main ingredients in the underlying DM scenario are a boosted DM particle and a heavier dark sector state. The relativistic DM impinged on target material scatters off inelastically to the heavier state which subsequently decays into DM along with lighter states including visible (Standard Model) particles. The expected signal event, therefore, accompanies a visible signature by the secondary cascade process associated with a recoiling of the target particle, differing from the typical neutrino signal not involving the secondary signature. We then discuss various kinematic features followed by DM detection prospects at large volume neutrino detectors with a model framework where a dark gauge boson is the mediator between the Standard Model particles and DM.",hep,hep-ex,0
Floquet edge solitons in modulated trimer waveguide arrays,"We show that one-dimensional Floquet trimer arrays with periodically oscillating waveguides support two different and co-existing types of topological Floquet edge states in two different topological gaps in Floquet spectrum. In these systems nontrivial topology is introduced by longitudinal periodic oscillations of the waveguide centers, leading to the formation of Floquet edge states in certain range of oscillation amplitudes despite the fact that the structure spends half of the period in ``instantaneously'' nontopological phase, and only during other half-period it is ``instantaneously'' topological. Two co-existing Floquet edge states are characterized by different phase relations between bright spots in the unit cell -- in one mode these spots are in-phase, while in other mode they are out-of-phase. We show that in focusing nonlinear medium topological Floquet edge solitons, representing exactly periodic nonlinear localized Floquet states, can bifurcate from both these types of linear edge states. Both types of Floquet edge solitons can be stable and can be created dynamically using two-site excitations.",nlin,nlin.PS,Sublattice synchronization of chaotic networks with delayed couplings,"Synchronization of chaotic units coupled by their time delayed variables are investigated analytically. A new type of cooperative behavior is found: sublattice synchronization. Although the units of one sublattice are not directly coupled to each other, they completely synchronize without time delay. The chaotic trajectories of different sublattices are only weakly correlated but not related by generalized synchronization. Nevertheless, the trajectory of one sublattice is predictable from the complete trajectory of the other one. The spectra of Lyapunov exponents are calculated analytically in the limit of infinite delay times, and phase diagrams are derived for different topologies.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Ideal strength of random alloys from first-principles theory,"The all-electron exact muffin-tin orbitals method in combination with the coherent-potential appproximation has been employed to investigate the ideal tensile strengths of elemental V, Mo solids and V- and Mo-based random solid solutions. The present ideal tensile strengths, calculated assuming isotropic Poisson contraction, are 16.1, 26.7 and 37.6 GPa for bcc V in the [001], [111] and [110] directions, respectively, and 26.7 GPa for bcc Mo in the [001] direction, which are all in good agreement with the available theoretical data. When a few percent Tc is introduced in Mo, it is found that the ideal strength decreases in the [001] direction. For the V-based alloys, Cr increases and Ti decreases the ideal tensile strength in all principal directions. Adding the same concentration of Cr and Ti to V leads to ternary alloys with similar ideal strength values as that of pure V. The alloying effects on the ideal strength is explained using the electronic band structure.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,Supersolid structure and excitation spectrum of soft-core bosons in 3D,"By means of a mean-field method, we have studied the zero temperature structure and excitation spectrum of a three-dimensional soft-core bosonic system for a value of the interaction strength that favors a crystal structure made of atomic nano-clusters arranged with FCC ordering. In addition to the longitudinal and transverse phonon branches expected for a normal crystal, the excitation spectrum shows a soft mode related to the breaking of gauge symmetry, which signals a partial superfluid character of the solid. Additional evidence of supersolidity is provided by the calculation of the superfluid fraction, which shows a first-order drop, from 1 to 0.4, at the liquid-supersolid transition and a monotonic decrease as the interaction strength parameter is increased. The conditions for the coexistence of the supersolid with the homogeneous superfluid are discussed, and the surface tension of a representative solid-liquid interface is calculated.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,0
Bifurcations in Boltzmann-Langevin One Body dynamics for fermionic systems,"We investigate the occurrence of bifurcations in the dynamical trajectories depicting central nuclear collisions at Fermi energies. The quantitative description of the reaction dynamics is obtained within a new transport model, based on the solution of the Boltzmann-Langevin equation in three dimensions, with a broad applicability for dissipative fermionic dynamics. Dilute systems formed in central collisions are shown to fluctuate between two energetically favourable mechanisms: reverting to a compact shape or rather disintegrating into several fragments. The latter result can be connected to the recent observation of bimodal distributions for quantities characterising fragmentation processes and may suggest new investigations.",nucl,nucl-th,High-mass dimuon resonances in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.5 TeV in CMS,"The measurement of the charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi'$) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon$, $\Upsilon'$, ${\Upsilon''}$) resonances and $Z^0$ boson in nucleus-nucleus collisions provides crucial information on high density QCD matter. The observation of anomalous suppression of $J/\psi$ at the CERN-SPS and RHIC is well established but the clarification of some important questions requires equivalent studies of the $\Upsilon$ family, only possible at LHC energies. The $Z^0$ boson will be produced for the first time in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and, since its dominant production channel is through $q{\bar q}$ fusion, it is an excellent probe of the nuclear modification of quark distribution functions. This paper reports the capabilities of the CMS detector to study quarkonium and $Z^0$ production in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.5 TeV, through the dimuon decay channel.",nucl,nucl-ex,0

The method is implemented and studied in the context of the 1+1-dimensional Schwinger model, a simple field theory which shares key features with the standard model of nuclear and particle physics.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Atomically Thin Boron Nitride: Unique Properties and Applications,"Atomically thin boron nitride (BN) is an important two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial, with many properties distinct from graphene. In this feature article, these unique properties and associated applications often not possible from graphene are outlined. The article starts with characterization and identification of atomically thin BN. It is followed by demonstrating their strong oxidation resistance at high temperatures and applications in protecting metals from oxidation and corrosion. As flat insulators, BN nanosheets are ideal dielectric substrates for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and electronic devices based on 2D heterostructures.

We study the in-plane and out-of-plane Fermi surfaces (FSs) of the SS in 8 monolayer Fe/Cu(001) films using energy dependent soft x-ray momentum-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We show that the SS originates in nested regions confined to out-of-plane FSs, which are drastically modified compared to in-plane FSs. From precise reciprocal space maps in successive zones, we obtain the associated real space compressive strain of 1.5+-0.5% along c-axis. An autocorrelation analysis quantifies the incommensurate ordering vector q=(2pi/a)(0,0,~0.86), favoring a SS and consistent with magneto-optic Kerr effect experiments.

Quartet condensation induced by the isovector pairing force,"The phenomenon of quartet condensation in the ground state of an isovector pairing Hamiltonian for an even-even $N=Z$ system is investigated. For this purpose we follow the evolution of the ground state from an unperturbed regime up to a strongly interacting one in a formalism of collective pairs. These pairs are those resulting from the diagonalization of the pairing Hamiltonian in a space of two particles coupled to isospin $T=1$. The ground state is found to rapidly evolve from a product of distinct $T=0$ quartets, each one formed by two of the above pairs, to a condensate of identical quartets built only with the pair corresponding to the lowest energy. This finding establishes a link between the complicated structure of the exact ground state and the simple approximation scheme of the Quartet Condensation Model. The mechanism at the basis of this quartet condensation turns out to be the same which is responsible for the development of a pair condensate in the ground state of a like-particle pairing Hamiltonian.",nucl,nucl-th,Beta-decay spectroscopy of $^{27}$S,"Background: Beta-decay spectroscopy provides valuable nuclear physics input for thermonuclear reaction rates of astrophysical interest and stringent test for shell-model theories far from the stability line. Purpose: The available decay properties of proton drip-line nucleus $^{27}$S is insufficient to constrain the properties of the key resonance in $^{26}$Si$(p,\gamma)^{27}$P reaction rate and probe the possible isospin asymmetry. The decay scheme of $^{27}$S is complicated and far from being understood, which has motivated but also presented challenges for our experiment. Method: The $^{27}$S ions were implanted into a double-sided silicon strip detector array surrounded by the high-purity germanium detectors, where the $\beta$-delayed protons and $\gamma$ rays were measured simultaneously. Results: The improved spectroscopic properties including the precise half-life of $^{27}$S, the excitation energies, $\beta$-decay branching ratios, log~$ft$ values, and $B$(GT) values for the states of $^{27}$P populated in the $\beta$ decay of $^{27}$S were measured and compared to the $^{27}$Mg mirror states and the shell-model calculations. The present work has expanded greatly on the previously established decay scheme of $^{27}$S. Conclusions: The precise proton-separation energy of $^{27}$P, the energy and the ratio between $\gamma$ and proton partial widths of the $3/2^+$ resonance were obtained, thereby determining the $^{26}$Si$(p,\gamma)^{27}$P reaction rate based mainly on experimental constraints. The first evidence for the observation of a large isospin asymmetry for the mirror decays of $^{27}$S and $^{27}$Na is also provided. The experimental spectroscopic information can be reproduced by the shell-model calculation taking the weakly bound effect of the proton $1s_{1/2}$ orbit into account.",nucl,nucl-ex,0
From Discovery to the First Month of the Type II Supernova 2023ixf: High and Variable Mass Loss in the Final Year before Explosion,"We present the discovery of the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in M101 and follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations, respectively, in the first month and week of its evolution. Our discovery was made within a day of estimated first light, and the following light curve is characterized by a rapid rise ($\approx5$ days) to a luminous peak ($M_V\approx-18.2$ mag) and plateau ($M_V\approx-17.6$ mag) extending to $30$ days with a fast decline rate of $\approx0.03$ mag day$^{-1}$. During the rising phase, $U-V$ color shows blueward evolution, followed by redward evolution in the plateau phase. Prominent flash features of hydrogen, helium, carbon, and nitrogen dominate the spectra up to $\approx5$ days after first light, with a transition to a higher ionization state in the first $\approx2$ days. Both the $U-V$ color and flash ionization states suggest a rise in the temperature, indicative of a delayed shock breakout inside dense circumstellar material (CSM). From the timescales of CSM interaction, we estimate its compact radial extent of $\sim(3-7)\times10^{14}$ cm. We then construct numerical light-curve models based on both continuous and eruptive mass-loss scenarios shortly before explosion. For the continuous mass-loss scenario, we infer a range of mass-loss history with $0.1-1.0\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ in the final $2-1$ yr before explosion, with a potentially decreasing mass loss of $0.01-0.1\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ in $\sim0.7-0.4$ yr toward the explosion. For the eruptive mass-loss scenario, we favor eruptions releasing $0.3-1\,M_\odot$ of the envelope at about a year before explosion, which result in CSM with mass and extent similar to the continuous scenario. We discuss the implications of the available multiwavelength constraints obtained thus far on the progenitor candidate and SN 2023ixf to our variable CSM models.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,What is the mass of alpha Cen B b?,"We investigate the possibility of constraining the sin i degeneracy of alpha Cen B b -- with orbital period P=3.24 d; a = 0.042 AU; msini = 1.1 M_earth -- to estimate the true mass of the newly reported terrestrial exoplanet in the nearest stellar system to our Sun. We present detailed numerical simulations of the dynamical stability of the exoplanet in the alpha Cen AB binary system for a range of initial inclinations, eccentricities, and semi-major axes. The system represents a benchmark case for the interplay of the Kozai mechanism, general relativistic and tidal forces. From our simulations, there is only a small boundary in initial inclinations and initial semi-major axes that result in the migration via the Kozai mechanism of alpha Cen B b to its present location. Inside this boundary, the planet orbit is stable for up to 1 Gyr against the Kozai mechanism, and outside this boundary the planet collides with alpha Cen B or is ejected. In our three simulations where the planet migrates in towards the star via the Kozai mechanism, the final inclination is 46-53 degrees relative to the AB orbital plane, lower than the initial inclination of 75 degrees in each case. We discuss inclination constraints from the formation of alpha Cen B b in situ at its present location, migration in a proto-planetary disk, or migration in resonance with additional planets. We conclude that alpha Cen B b probably has a mass of less than 2.7 M_earth, implying a likely terrestrial composition warranting future confirmation.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,0
Study of Lambda polarization at RHIC BES and LHC energies,"In hydrodynamic approach to relativistic heavy ion collisions, hadrons with nonzero spin, produced out of the hydrodynamic medium, can acquire polarization via spin-vorticity thermodynamic coupling mechanism. The hydrodynamical quantity steering the polarization is the thermal vorticity, that is minus the antisymmetric part of the gradient of four-temperature field. Based on this mechanism there have been several calculations in hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic models for non-central heavy ion collisions in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan energy range, showing that the amount of polarization of produced $\Lambda$ hyperons ranges from few percents to few permille, and decreases with collision energy. We report on an extension of our existing calculation of global $\Lambda$ polarization in UrQMD+vHLLE model to full RHIC and LHC energies, and discuss the component of polarization along the beam direction, which is the dominant one at high energies.",nucl,nucl-ex,Effective Chiral Symmetry Restoration for Heavy-Light Mesons,We study the spectrum of heavy-light mesons within a model with linear instantaneous confining potential.

Role of environment on nuclear activity,"Motivated by the apparently conflicting results reported in the literature on the effect of environment on nuclear activity, we have carried out a new analysis by comparing the fraction of galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the most overdense regions (rich galaxy clusters) and the most underdense ones (voids) in the local universe. Exploiting the classical BPT diagnostics, we have extracted volume limited samples of star forming and AGN galaxies. We find that, at variance with star-forming galaxies, AGN galaxies have similar distributions of specific star formation rates and of galactic ages (as indicated by the Dn4000 parameter) both in clusters and in voids. In both environments galaxies hosting AGNs are generally old, with low star formation activity. The AGN fraction increases faster with stellar mass in clusters than in voids, especially above 10^10.2 M(sun). Our results indicate that, in the local universe, the nuclear activity correlates with stellar mass and galaxy morphology and is weakly, if at all, affected by the local galaxy density.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Investigation of Rocket Effect in BRC 18 using Gaia EDR3,"Bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs) are ideal candidates to study radiation-driven implosion mode of star formation as they are potential sites of triggered star formation, located at the edges of H{\sc ii} regions, showing evidence of ongoing star formation processes. BRC 18 is located towards the eastern edge of relatively closer ($\sim$400 pc) H{\sc ii} region excited by $\lambda$ Ori. We made R-band polarimetric observations of 17 candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) located towards BRC 18 to investigate any preferred orientation of the discs with respect to the ambient magnetic field and the direction of energetic photons from $\lambda$ Ori. We found that the discs are oriented randomly with respect to the projected magnetic field. Using distances and proper motions from the \textit{Gaia} EDR3 of the candidate YSOs, we investigated the possible acceleration of BRC 18, away from $\lambda$ Ori due to the well known ""Rocket Effect"", by assuming that both the candidate YSOs and BRC 18 are kinematically coupled. The relative proper motions of the candidate YSOs are found to show a trend of moving away from $\lambda$ Ori. We computed the offset between the angle of the direction of the ionization front and the relative proper motion of the candidate YSOs and found it to lie close to being parallel to each other. Additionally, we found 12 sources that are comoving with the known candidate YSOs towards BRC 18.

The transverse momentum spectra at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 0.5$) for charged $\rm\Xi$ and $\rm\Omega$ hyperons have been studied in the range $0.6 < p_{\rm T} < 8.0$ GeV/$c$ and $1.2 < p_{\rm T} < 7.0$ GeV/$c$, respectively, and in several centrality intervals (from the most central 0-10% to the most peripheral 60-80% collisions). These spectra have been compared with the predictions of recent hydrodynamic models. In particular, the Krak${\'o}$w and EPOS models give a satisfactory description of the data, with the latter covering a wider $p_{\rm T}$ range. Mid-rapidity yields, integrated over $p_{\rm T}$, have been determined. The hyperon-to-pion ratios are similar to those at RHIC: they rise smoothly with centrality up to $\langle N_{\rm part}\rangle$~150 and saturate thereafter. The enhancements (yields per participant nucleon relative to pp collisions) increase both with the strangeness content of the baryon and with centrality, but are less pronounced than at lower energies.",hep,hep-ex,0
Modeling continuum polarization levels of tidal disruption events based on the collision-induced outflow mode,"TDEs have been observed in the optical and UV for more than a decade but the underlying emission mechanism still remains a puzzle. It has been suggested that viewing angle effects could potentially explain their large photometric and spectroscopic diversity. Polarization is indeed sensitive to the viewing angle and the first polarimetry studies of TDEs are now available, calling for a theoretical interpretation. In this study, we model the continuum polarization levels of TDEs using the radiative transfer code POSSIS and the collision-induced outflow (CIO) TDE emission scenario where unbound shocked gas originating from a debris stream intersection point offset from the black hole, reprocesses the hard emission from the accretion flow into UV and optical bands. We explore two different cases of peak mass fallback rates M'p (~3 and ~0.3 Msol/yr) while varying the following geometrical parameters: the distance R_int from the black hole (BH) to the intersection point, the radius of the photosphere around the BH R_ph, on the surface of which the photons are generated, and the opening angle Deltheta (anisotropic emission). For the high mass fallback rate case, we find for every viewing angle polarization levels below one (P<1%) and P<0.5% for 10/12 simulations. The absolute value of polarization reaches its maximum (P_max) for equatorial viewing angles. For the low mass fallback rate case, the maximum value predicted is P~8.8% and P_max is reached for intermediate viewing angles. We find that the polarization depends strongly on i) the optical depths at the central regions set by the different M'p values and ii) the viewing angle. Finally, by comparing our model predictions to polarization observations of a few TDEs, we attempt to constrain their observed viewing angles and we show that multi-epoch polarimetric observations can become a key factor in constraining the viewing angle of TDEs.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,DRAGONS -- A Quick Overview,"DRAGONS (Data Reduction for Astronomy from Gemini Observatory North and South) is a platform for the reduction and processing of astronomical data.

A Model for Energy Buildup and Eruption Onset in Coronal Mass Ejections,"Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and eruptive flares (EFs) are the most energetic explosions in the solar system. Their underlying origin is the free energy that builds up slowly in the sheared magnetic field of a filament channel. We report the first end-to-end numerical simulation of a CME/EF, from zero-free-energy initial state through filament-channel formation to violent eruption, driven solely by the magnetic-helicity condensation process. Helicity is the topological measure of linkages between magnetic flux systems, and is conserved in the corona, building up inexorably until it is ejected into interplanetary space. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that helicity injected by small-scale vortical motions, such as those observed in the photosphere, undergoes an inverse cascade from small scales to large, `condensing' at magnetic-polarity boundaries. Our new results verify that this process forms a filament channel within a compact bipolar region embedded in a background dipole field, and show for the first time that a fast CME eventually occurs via the magnetic-breakout mechanism. We further show that the trigger for explosive eruption is reconnection onset in the flare current sheet that develops above the polarity inversion line: this reconnection forms flare loops below the sheet and a CME flux rope above, and initiates high-speed outward flow of the CME. Our findings have important implications for magnetic self-organization and explosive behavior in solar and other astrophysical plasmas, and for understanding and predicting explosive solar activity.",physics,physics.space-ph,Modeling film flows down a fibre influenced by nozzle geometry,"We study the effects of nozzle geometry on the dynamics of thin fluid films flowing down a vertical cylindrical fibre.

Wave interactions and the analysis of the perturbed Burgers equation,"In multiple-front solutions of the Burgers equation, all the fronts, except for two, are generated through the inelastic interaction of exponential wave solutions of the Lax pair associated with the equation. The inelastically generated fronts are the source of two difficulties encountered in the standard Normal Form expansion of the approximate solution of the perturbed Burgers equation, when the zero-order term is a multiple-front solution: (i) The higher-order terms in the expansion are not bounded; (ii) The Normal Form (equation obeyed by the zero-order approximation) is not asymptotically integrable; its solutions lose the simple wave structure of the solutions of the un-perturbed equation. The freedom inherent in the Normal Form method allows a simple modification of the expansion procedure, making it possible to overcome both problems in more than one way. The loss of asymptotic integrability is shifted from the Normal Form to the higher-order terms (part of which has to be computed numerically) in the expansion of the solution. The front-velocity update is different from the one obtained in the standard analysis.",nlin,nlin.SI,Synchronization Dynamics in the Presence of Coupling Delays and Phase Shifts,"In systems of coupled oscillators, the effects of complex signaling can be captured by time delays and phase shifts.

For spatially extended systems with time delays, we show that fastest synchronization can occur for intermediate wavelengths, giving rise to novel synchronization scenarios.",nlin,nlin.AO,0
In-phase synchronization in complex oscillator networks by adaptive delayed feedback control,"In-phase synchronization is a special case of synchronous behavior when coupled oscillators have the same phases for any time moments. Such behavior appears naturally for nearly identical coupled limit-cycle oscillators when the coupling strength is greatly above the synchronization threshold. We investigate the general class of nearly identical complex oscillators connected into network in a context of a phase reduction approach. By treating each oscillator as a black-box possessing a single-input single-output, we provide a practical and simply realizable control algorithm to attain the in-phase synchrony of the network. For a general diffusive-type coupling law and any value of a coupling strength (even greatly below the synchronization threshold) the delayed feedback control with a specially adjusted time-delays can provide in-phase synchronization. Such adjustment of the delay times performed in an automatic fashion by the use of an adaptive version of the delayed feedback algorithm when time-delays become time-dependent slowly varying control parameters. Analytical results show that there are many arrangements of the time-delays for the in-phase synchronization, therefore we supplement the algorithm by an additional requirement to choose appropriate set of the time-delays, which minimize power of a control force. Performed numerical validations of the predictions highlights the usefulness of our approach.",nlin,nlin.AO,Breathers or quasibreathers?,"For the James breathers in the K2-K3-K4 chain and for breathers in the K4-chain, we prove numerically that these dynamical objects are not strictly time-periodic.

We refer to the dynamical objects with such properties as quasibreathers. For the K4-chain, a rigorous investigation of existence and stability of the breathers and quasibreathers is presented. In particular, it is proved that they are stable up to a certain strength of the intersite part of the potential with respect to its on-site part. We conjecture that the main results of this paper are also valid in the general case and, therefore, it seems that one must speak about quasibreathers rather than about strictly time-periodic breathers.",nlin,nlin.PS,0
Diverse routes of transition from amplitude to oscillation death in coupled oscillators under additional repulsive link,"We report the existence of diverse routes of transition from amplitude death (AD) to oscillation death (OD) in three different diffusively coupled systems, those are perturbed by a symmetry break- ing repulsive coupling link. For limit cycle systems the transition is through a pitchfork bifurcation (PB) as has been noted before, but in chaotic systems it can be through a saddle-node or a trans- critical bifurcation depending on the nature of the underlying dynamics of the individual systems. The diversity of the routes and their dependence on the complex dynamics of the coupled systems not only broadens our understanding of this important phenomenon but can lead to potentially new practical applications.",nlin,nlin.CD,Strong Ordering by Non-uniformity of Thresholds in a Coupled Map Lattice,"The coupled map lattice by Olami {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 68}, 1244 (1992)] is ``doped'' by letting just {\it one} site have a threshold, $T^{*}_{\rm max}$, bigger than the others. On an $L \times L$ lattice with periodic boundary conditions this leads to a transition from avalanche sizes of about one to exactly $L^2$, and after each avalanche stresses distributes among only five distinct values, $\tau_{k}$, related to the parameters $\alpha $ and $T^{*}_{\rm max}$ by $\tau_{k}= k\alpha T^{*}_{\rm max}$ where $k=0,1,2,3,4$. This result is independent of lattice size. The transient times are inversely proportional to the amount of doping and increase linearly with $L$.",nlin,nlin.AO,0
Dissipative soliton generation and real-time dynamics in microresonator-filtered fiber lasers,"Optical frequency combs in microresonators (microcombs) have a wide range of applications in science and technology, due to its compact size and access to considerably larger comb spacing. Despite recent successes, the problems of self-starting, high mode efficiency as well as high output power have not been fully addressed for conventional soliton microcombs. Recent demonstration of laser cavity soliton microcombs by nesting a microresonator into a fiber cavity, shows great potential to solve the problems. Here we comprehensively study the dissipative soliton generation and interaction dynamics in a microresonator-filtered fiber laser in both theory and experiment. We first bring theoretical insight into the mode-locking principle, discuss the parameters effect on soliton properties and provide experimental guidelines for broadband soliton generation. We predict chirped bright dissipative soliton with flat-top spectral envelope in microresonators with normal dispersion, which is fundamentally infeasible for externally driven case. Furthermore, we experimentally achieve soliton microcombs with large bandwidth of ~10 nm and high mode efficiency of 90.7%. Finally, by taking advantage of an ultrahigh-speed time magnifier, we study the real-time soliton formation and interaction dynamics and experimentally observe soliton Newton's cradle. Our study will benefit the design of the novel, high-efficiency and self-starting microcombs for real-world applications.",nlin,nlin.PS,"Chaotic Advection and the Emergence of Tori in the K\""uppers-Lortz State","Motivated by the roll-switching behavior observed in rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, we define a K\""uppers-Lortz (K-L) state as a volume-preserving flow with periodic roll switching. For an individual roll state, the Lagrangian particle trajectories are periodic. In a system with roll-switching, the particles can exhibit three-dimensional, chaotic motion. We study a simple phenomenological map that models the Lagrangian dynamics in a K-L state. When the roll axes differ by $120^{\circ}$ in the plane of rotation, we show that the phase space is dominated by invariant tori if the ratio of switching time to roll turnover time is small. When this parameter approaches zero these tori limit onto the classical hexagonal convection patterns, and, as it gets large, the dynamics becomes fully chaotic and well-mixed. For intermediate values, there are interlinked toroidal and poloidal structures separated by chaotic regions. We also compute the exit time distributions and show that the unbounded chaotic orbits are normally diffusive. Although the map presumes instantaneous switching between roll states, we show that the qualitative features of the flow persist when the model has smooth, overlapping time-dependence for the roll amplitudes (the Busse-Heikes model).",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Three-dimensional splitting dynamics of giant vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates,"We study the splitting dynamics of giant vortices in dilute Bose-Einstein condensates by numerically integrating the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation in time. By taking advantage of tetrahedral tiling in the spatial discretization, we decrease the error and increase the reliability of the numerical method. An extensive survey of vortex splitting symmetries is presented for different aspect ratios of the harmonic trapping potential. The symmetries of the splitting patterns observed in the simulated dynamics are found to be in good agreement with predictions obtained by solving the dominant dynamical instabilities from the corresponding Bogoliubov equations. Furthermore, we observe intertwining of the split vortices in prolate condensates and a split-and-revival phenomenon in a spherical condensate.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Infrared Peak-Splitting from phonon localization in Solid Hydrogen,"We show that the isotope effect leads to a completely different spectroscopic signal in hydrogen-deuterium mixtures, compared to pure elements that have the same crystal structure. This is particularly true for molecular vibrations, which are the main source of information about the structure of high-pressure hydrogen. Mass disorder breaks translational symmetry, meaning that vibrations are localized almost to single molecules, and are not zone-center phonons. In mixtures, each observable IR peak corresponds to a collection of many such molecular vibrations, which have a distribution of frequencies depending on local environment. Furthermore discrete groups of environments cause the peaks to split. We illustrate this issue by considering the IR spectrum of the high pressure Phase III structure of hydrogen, recently interpreted as showing novel phases in isotopic mixtures. We calculate the IR spectrum of hydrogen/deuterium mixtures in the $C2/c$ and $Cmca$-12 structures, showing that isotopic disorder gives rise to mode localization of the high frequency vibrons. The local coordination of the molecules leads to discrete IR peaks. The spread of frequencies is strongly enhanced with pressure, such that more peaks become resolvable at higher pressures, in agreement with the recent measurements.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,0
Lax pair for the Adler (lattice Krichever-Novikov) System,"In the paper [V. Adler, IMRN {\bf 1} (1998) 1--4] a lattice version of the Krichever-Novikov equation was constructed.

The dynamics is studied numerically by means of two different symbolic encoding schemes, both relying on the fact that it maps polygons to polygons: in the first scheme we consider dynamically generated partitions made out of suitable sets of disjoint polygons, in the second we consider the standard binary partition of the torus induced by the discontinuity set. These encoding schemes are studied in detail and shown to be compatible, although not equivalent. The ergodic properties of the triangle map are then investigated in terms of the Markov transition matrices associated to the above schemes and furthermore compared to the spectral properties of the Koopman operator in L2(T2). Finally, a stochastic version of the triangle map is introduced and studied. A simple heuristic analysis of the latter yields the correct statistical and scaling behaviours of the correlation functions of the original map.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Ansatz of Hans Bethe for a two-dimensional Bose gas,"The method of q-oscillator lattices, proposed recently in [hep-th/0509181], provides the tool for a construction of various integrable models of quantum mechanics in 2+1 dimensional space-time. In contrast to any one dimensional quantum chain, its two dimensional generalizations -- quantum lattices -- admit different geometrical structures. In this paper we consider the q-oscillator model on a special lattice. The model may be interpreted as a two-dimensional Bose gas. The most remarkable feature of the model is that it allows the coordinate Bethe Ansatz: the p-particles' wave function is the sum of plane waves. Consistency conditions is the set of 2p equations for p one-particle wave vectors. These ""Bethe Ansatz"" equations are the main result of this paper.",nlin,nlin.SI,Large-scale spatio-temporal patterns in a ring of non-locally coupled oscillators with a repulsive coupling,"Non-locally coupled oscillators with a phase lag exhibit various non-trivial spatio-temporal patterns such as the chimera states and the multi-twisted states. We numerically study large-scale spatio-temporal patterns in a ring of oscillators with a repulsive coupling with a phase delay parameter $\alpha$. We find that the multi-chimera state disappears when $\alpha$ exceeds a critical value. Analyzing the density of incoherent regions, we show that the transition is analogous to that of directed percolation with two absorbing states, but their critical behaviors are different. The multi-chimera state reappears when $\alpha$ is further increased, exhibiting non-trivial spatio-temporal patterns with a plateau in the density of incoherent regions. A transition from the multi-chimera to multi-twisted states follows at a larger value of $\alpha$, resulting in five collective phases in total.",nlin,nlin.AO,0
Tuning Self Organization Of Confined Active Particles By Steepness Of The Trap,"We consider collective dynamics of self-propelling particles in two dimensions. They can align themselves according to the direction of propulsion of their neighbours, together with a random perturbation (i.e. rotational fluctuation). They are also interacting with each other by a soft, isotropic, excluded-volume interaction. Particles are confined in a circular trap. The steepness of the trap is tuneable. Their average packing fraction and strength of rotational fluctuation are low. When the trap is steep, particles flock along its boundary. They form polar cluster that spreads over the boundary. The cluster has no spatial or structural order. We show, when the steepness is decreased beyond a threshold value, the clusters become round, compact and eventually spatial order (hexagonal) emerges in addition to the pre-established polar order within them. We investigate kinetics of such ordering. We find that while rotating around the centre of the trap along its circular boundary, the clusters need to roll around their centre of mass, to be spatially ordered. We also discuss the stability of the order when the trap is suddenly switched off.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Evaluating and improving the cluster variation method entropy functional for Ising alloys,"The success of the ""Cluster Variation Method"" (CVM) in reproducing quite accurately the free energies of Monte Carlo (MC) calculations on Ising models is explained in terms of identifying a cancellation of errors: We show that the CVM produces correlation functions that are too close to zero, which leads to an overestimation of the exact energy, E, and at the same time, to an underestimation of -TS, so the free energy F=E-TS is more accurate than either of its parts. This insight explains a problem with ""hybrid methods"" using MC correlation functions in the CVM entropy expression: They give exact energies E and do not give significantly improved -TS relative to CVM, so they do not benefit from the above noted cancellation of errors. Additionally, ""hybrid methods"" suffer from the difficulty of adequately accounting for both ordered and disordered phases in a consistent way. A different technique, the ""Entropic Monte Carlo"" (EMC), is shown here to provide a means for critically evaluating the CVM entropy. Inspired by EMC results, we find a universal and simple correction to the CVM entropy which produces individual components of the free energy with MC accuracy, but is computationally much less expensive than either MC thermodynamic integration or EMC.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,0
Post-inflationary thermal histories and the refractive index of relic gravitons,"We investigate the impact of the post-inflationary thermal histories on the cosmic graviton spectrum caused by the inflationary variation of their refractive index. Depending on the frequency band, the spectral energy distribution can be mildly red, blue or even violet. Wide portions of the parameter space lead to potentially relevant signals both in the audio range (probed by the advanced generation of terrestrial interferometers) and in the mHz band (where space-borne detectors could be operational within the incoming score year). The description of the refractive index in conformally related frames is clarified.",hep,hep-ph,On Lagrangian formulation of Higher Spin Theories on AdS,In this short note we present a Lagrangian formulation for free bosonic Higher Spin fields which belong to massless reducible representations of D-dimensional Anti de Sitter group using an ambient space formalism.,hep,hep-th,0
A note on the motion of surfaces,"We study the motion of surfaces in an intrinsic formulation in which the surface is described by its metric and curvature tensors. The evolution equations for the six quantities contained in these tensors are reduced in number in two cases: (i) for arbitrary surfaces, we use principal coordinates to obtain two equations for the two principal curvatures, highlighting the similarity with the equations of motion of a plane curve; and (ii) for surfaces with spatially constant negative curvature, we use parameterization by Tchebyshev nets to reduce to a single evolution equation. We also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a surface to maintain spatially constant negative curvature as it moves. One choice for the surface's normal motion leads to the modified-Korteweg de Vries equation,the appearance of which is explained by connections to the AKNS hierarchy and the motion of space curves.",nlin,nlin.SI,Bifurcating bright and dark solitary waves of the nearly nonlinear cubic-quintic Schrodinger equation,"The existence of bright and dark multi-bump solitary waves for Ginzburg-Landau type perturbations of the cubic-quintic Schrodinger equation is considered. The waves in question are not perturbations of known analytic solitary waves, but instead arise as a bifurcation from a heteroclinic cycle in a three dimensional ODE phase space. Using geometric singular perturbation techniques, regions in parameter space for which 1-bump bright and dark solitary waves will bifurcate are identified. The existence of N-bump dark solitary waves is shown via an application of the Exchange Lemma with Exponentially Small Error. N-bump bright solitary waves are shown to exist as a consequence of the previous work of S. Maier-Paape and this author.",nlin,nlin.PS,0
Inflationary Imprints on Dark Matter,"We show that dark matter abundance and the inflationary scale $H$ could be intimately related. Standard Model extensions with Higgs mediated couplings to new physics typically contain extra scalars displaced from vacuum during inflation. If their coupling to Standard Model is weak, they will not thermalize and may easily constitute too much dark matter reminiscent to the moduli problem. As an example we consider Standard Model extended by a $Z_2$ symmetric singlet $s$ coupled to the Standard Model Higgs $\Phi$ via $\lambda \Phi^{\dag}\Phi s^2$. Dark matter relic density is generated non-thermally for $\lambda \lesssim 10^{-7}$. We show that the dark matter yield crucially depends on the inflationary scale. For $H\sim 10^{10}$ GeV we find that the singlet self-coupling and mass should lie in the regime $\lambda_{\rm s}\gtrsim 10^{-9}$ and $m_{\rm s}\lesssim 50$ GeV to avoid dark matter overproduction.",hep,hep-ph,Insight into $D/B\to \pi \ell \nu_\ell$ decay using the pole models,"After improving the knowledge about residua of the semileptonic form factor at its first two poles we show that $f_+^{D\pi}(q^2)$ is not saturated when compared with the experimental data. To fill the difference we approximate the rest of discontinuity by an effective pole and show that the data can be described very well with the position of the effective pole larger than the next excitation in the spectrum of $D^\ast$ state. The results of fits with experimental data also suggest the validity of superconvergence which in the pole models translates to a vanishing of the sum of residua of the form factor at all poles. A similar discussion in the case of $B\to \pi \ell\nu_\ell$ leads to the possibility of extracting $\vert V_{ub}\vert$, the error of which appears to be dominated by $g_{B^\ast B\pi}$, which can be nowadays computed on the lattice. In evaluating the residua of the form factors at their nearest pole we needed the vector meson decay constants $f_{D^\ast}$ and $f_{B^\ast}$, which we computed by using the numerical simulations of QCD on the lattice with $N_{\rm f}=2$ dynamical quarks. We obtain, $f_{D^\ast}/f_D=1.208(27)$ and $f_{B^\ast}/f_B=1.051(17)$.",hep,hep-ex,0
Evidences for higher nocturnal seismic activity at the Mt. Vesuvius,"We analyze hourly seismic data measured at the Osservatorio Vesuviano Ovest (OVO, 1972-2014) and at the Bunker Est (BKE, 1999-2014) stations on the Mt. Vesuvius. The OVO record is complete for seismic events with magnitude M > 1.9. We demonstrate that before 1996 this record presents a daily oscillation that nearly vanishes afterwards. To determine whether a daily oscillation exists in the seismic activity of the Mt. Vesuvius, we use the higher quality BKE record that is complete for seismic events with magnitude M > 0.2. We demonstrate that BKE confirms that the seismic activity at the Mt. Vesuvius is higher during nighttime than during day-time. The amplitude of the daily oscillation is enhanced during summer and damped during winter. We speculate possible links with the cooling/warming diurnal cycle of the volcanic edifice, with external geomagnetic field and with magnetostriction that should also stress the rocks. We find that the amplitude of the seismic daily cycle changes in time and has been increasing since 2008. Finally, we propose a seismic activity index to monitor the 24-hour oscillation that could be used to complement other methodologies currently adopted to determine the seismic status of the volcano and to prevent the relative hazard.",physics,physics.geo-ph,Direct van der Waals simulation (DVS) of phase-transforming fluids,"We present the method of Direct van der Waals simulation (DVS) to study computationally flows with liquid-vapor phase transformations.

The proposed algorithm enables unprecedented simulations of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations involving cavitating flows at strongly under-critical conditions and $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ Reynolds number.

Counterflow instability and turbulence in a spin-1 spinor Bose--Einstein condensate,"We theoretically study counterflow instability and turbulence in a spin-1 spinor Bose--Einstein condensate by the Gross--Pitaevskii equation and the Bogoliubov--de Gennes equation. Our study considers (i) the dynamics induced by the counterflow of two components with different magnetic quantum numbers, which leads to turbulence with spin degrees of freedom, and (ii) the properties of the turbulence. For (i), the behavior of the condensate induced by the counterflow strongly depends on whether the spin-dependent interaction is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic, leading to different behaviors for the dispersion relation and the spin density vector, $etc$. For (ii), we numerically calculate the spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction energy, which also depends on the spin-dependent interaction. The spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction energy in the ferromagnetic case exhibits a -7/3 power law, whereas that in the antiferromagnetic case does not. The -7/3 power law can be explained by scaling analysis.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Transport through periodically driven systems: Green's function approach formulated within frequency domain,"The steady-state electronic transport across periodically driven systems can be efficiently addressed using Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker formalism. The time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function theory then may be adapted for developing direct and universal calculation schemes. Here we propose an alternative scheme to carry out the calculations. The idea is based on treating the transport problem in frequency domain and designing Green's functions for the corresponding Hamiltonians rewritten in Floquet-Sambe formalism. We show that within our approach the expressions for time-periodic currents and densities essentially replicate the well known formulas from time-independent theory. The results are then simplified for easier implementation in numeric computations.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,0
Theory Uncertainty in Extracting the Proton's Weak Charge: White Paper,"We review the state-of-the-art and address open questions relative to the theory uncertainty of the $\gamma-Z$ box contribution to the $A_{PV}$ measurement within the QWEAK experiment at Jefferson Lab.

For the experiment, the Big Instrument for Nuclear-polarization Analysis (BINA) was used at KVI, Groningen, the Netherlands. The data are compared to the predictions of Faddeev calculations using state-of-the-art two- and three-nucleon potentials. Our data are reasonably well described by calculations for the kinematical configurations at which the three-nucleon force (3NF) effect is predicted to be small. However, striking discrepancies are observed at specific configurations, in particular in the cases of symmetric configurations, where the relative azimuthal angle between the two protons is small which corresponds to the $d(p,{\rm{^{2}He}})n$ channel. The vector analyzing powers of these configurations are compared to the proton deuteron elastic scattering to study the spin-isospin sensitivity of the 3NF models. The results are compared to the earlier results of the proton-deuteron break-up reaction at 190 MeV proton-beam energy \cite{Mardanpour2010}. A disagreement is observed for both proton-beam energies between data and calculations which points to a deficiency in the treatment of spin-isospin part of the 3NF.",nucl,nucl-ex,0
Integrable discretizations of some cases of the rigid body dynamics,"A heavy top with a fixed point and a rigid body in an ideal fluid are important examples of Hamiltonian systems on a dual to the semidirect product Lie algebra $e(n)=so(n)\ltimes\mathbb R^n$. We give a Lagrangian derivation of the corresponding equations of motion, and introduce discrete time analogs of two integrable cases of these systems: the Lagrange top and the Clebsch case, respectively. The construction of discretizations is based on the discrete time Lagrangian mechanics on Lie groups, accompanied by the discrete time Lagrangian reduction. The resulting explicit maps on $e^*(n)$ are Poisson with respect to the Lie--Poisson bracket, and are also completely integrable. Lax representations of these maps are also found.",nlin,nlin.SI,A Mathematical Model with Modified Logistic Approach for Singly-Peaked Population Processes,"When a small number of individuals of organism of single species is confined in a closed space with limited amount of indispensable resources, their breading may start initially under suitable conditions, and after peaking, the population should go extinct as the resources are exhausted. Starting with the logistic equation and assuming that the carrying capacity of the environment is a function of the amount of resources, a mathematical model describing such pattern of population change is obtained. An application of this model to typical population records, that of deer herds by Scheffer (1951) and O'Roke and Hamerstrome (1948), yields estimations of the initial amount of indispensable food and its availability or nutritional efficiency which were previously unspecified.",nlin,nlin.AO,0
Spatial fluctuations of the intergalactic temperature-density relation after hydrogen reionization,"The thermal state of the post-reionization IGM is sensitive to the timing of reionization and the nature of the ionizing sources. We have modelled here the thermal state of the IGM in cosmological radiative transfer simulations of a realistic, extended, spatially inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization process, carefully calibrated with Ly-alpha forest data. We compare these with cosmological simulations run using a spatially homogeneous ionizing background. The simulations with a realistic growth of ionized regions and a realistic spread in reionization redshifts show, as expected, significant spatial fluctuations in the temperature-density relation (TDR) of the post-reionization IGM. The most recently ionized regions are hottest and exhibit a flatter TDR. In simulations consistent with the average TDR inferred from Ly-alpha forest data, these spatial fluctuations have a moderate but noticeable effect on the statistical properties of the Ly-alpha opacity of the IGM at z ~ 4-6. This should be taken into account in accurate measurements of the thermal properties of the IGM and the free-streaming of dark matter from Ly-alpha forest data in this redshift range. The spatial variations of the TDR predicted by our simulations are, however, smaller by about a factor two than would be necessary to explain the observed large spatial opacity fluctuations on large (> 50 comoving Mpc/h) scales at z > 5.5.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Surface brightness discontinuities in radio halos. Insights from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey,"Dynamical motions in the ICM can imprint distinctive features on X-ray images that map the thermal emission from galaxy clusters, such as sharp surface brightness discontinuities due to shocks and cold fronts. The gas dynamics during cluster mergers may also drive large-scale turbulence in the ICM, which in turn generates extended synchrontron sources known as radio halos. Surface brightness edges have been found numerous times in the thermal gas of clusters based on X-ray observations. In contrast, edges in radio halos have only been observed in a handful of cases. Our goal is to search for new radio surface brightness discontinuities in the ICM. We inspected the images of the Bullet Cluster and the other 25 radio halos reported in the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey. To aid the identification of surface brightness discontinuities, we applied a gradient-filtering edge-detection method to the radio images. We find that the adopted filtering technique is helpful in identifying surface brightness edges in radio images, allowing us to identify at least one gradient in half of the radio halos studied. For the Bullet Cluster, we find excellent agreement between the locations of the 4 radio discontinuities detected and the X-ray edges. This similarity informs us that there is substantial interplay between thermal and nonthermal components in galaxy clusters. This interplay is likely due to the frozen-in ICM magnetic field, which mediates the advection of cosmic rays while being dragged by thermal gas flows. We conclude that radio halos are shaped by dynamical motions in the ICM and that they often display surface brightness discontinuities, which appear to be co-located with edges in the thermal gas emission. Our results demonstrate that new and future generations of radio telescopes will provide a complementary approach to X-rays to efficiently detect shocks and cold fronts in the ICM.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,0
The accurate and comprehensive model of thin fluid flows with inertia on curved substrates,"Consider the 3D flow of a viscous Newtonian fluid upon a curved 2D substrate when the fluid film is thin as occurs in many draining, coating and biological flows. We derive a comprehensive model of the dynamics of the film, the model being expressed in terms of the film thickness and the average lateral velocity. Based upon centre manifold theory, we are assured that the model accurately includes the effects of the curvature of substrate, gravitational body force, fluid inertia and dissipation. The model may be used to resolve wave-like phenomena in the dynamics of viscous fluid flows over arbitrarily curved substrates such as cylinders, tubes and spheres. We briefly illustrate its use in simulating drop formation on cylindrical fibres, wave transitions, Faraday waves, viscous hydraulic jumps, and flow vortices in a compound channel. These models are the most complete models for thin film flow of a Newtonian fluid; many other thin film models can be obtained by different truncations of the dynamical equations given herein.",nlin,nlin.CD,Vectorial Ribaucour Transformations for the Lame Equations,"The vectorial extension of the Ribaucour transformation for the Lame equations of orthogonal conjugates nets in multidimensions is given.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking of photonic and matter waves in two-dimensional pseudopotentials,"We introduce the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii/nonlinear-Schrodinger (GP/NLS) equation with the self-focusing nonlinearity confined to two identical circles, separated or overlapped. The model can be realized in terms of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and photonic-crystal fibers. Following the recent analysis of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of localized modes trapped in 1D and 2D double-well nonlinear potentials (also known as pseudopotentials), we aim to find 2D solitons in the two-circle setting, using numerical methods and the variational approximation (VA). Well-separated circles support stable symmetric and antisymmetric solitons. The decrease of separation L between the circles leads to destabilization of the solitons. The symmetric modes undergo two SSB transitions. First, they are transformed into weakly asymmetric breathers, which is followed by a transition to single-peak modes trapped in one circle. The antisymmetric solitons perform a direct transition to the single-peak mode. The symmetric solitons are described reasonably well by the VA. For touching (L=0) and overlapping (L<0) circles, single-peak solitons are found-asymmetric ones, trapped in either circle, and symmetric solitons centered at the midpoint of the bi-circle configuration. If the overlap is weak, the symmetric soliton is unstable. It may spontaneously leap into either circle and perform shuttle motion in it. A region of stability of the symmetric solitons appears with the increase of the overlap degree. In the case of a moderately strong overlap, another SSB effect is found, in the form of a pair of symmetry-breaking and restoring bifurcations which link families of the symmetric and asymmetric solitons.",nlin,nlin.PS,Suppression of chaos by weak resonant excitations in a nonlinear oscillator with a non-symmetric potential,We examine the Mielnikov criterion for transition to chaos in case of one degree of freedom nonlinear oscillator with non symmetric potential.

Charmed Pseudoscalar and Vector Mesons: a Comprehensive QCD Sum-Rule View of Their Decay Constants,"In spite of undeniable similarities of the applied techniques, somewhat different challenges are encountered when extracting, from QCD sum rules derived from two-point correlators of appropriate interpolating heavy-light quark currents, the decay constants of charmed mesons of pseudoscalar nature, on the one hand, or of vector nature, on the other hand.

Charge reversal of colloidal particles,"A theory is presented for the effective charge of colloidal particles in suspensions containing multivalent counterions. It is shown that if colloids are sufficiently strongly charged, the number of condensed multivalent counterion can exceed the bare colloidal charge leading to charge reversal. Charge renormalization in suspensions with multivalent counterions depends on a subtle interplay between the solvation energies of the multivalent counterions in the bulk and near the colloidal surface. We find that the effective charge is {\it not} a monotonically decreasing function of the multivalent salt concentration. Furthermore, contrary to the previous theories, it is found that except at very low concentrations, monovalent salt hinders the charge reversal. This conclusion is in agreement with the recent experiments and simulations.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Features of spin-charge separation in the equilibrium conductance through finite rings,"We calculate the conductance through rings with few sites $L$ described by the $t-J$ model, threaded by a magnetic flux $\Phi$ and weakly coupled to conducting leads at two arbitrary sites.

We determine analytically the particular values of $\Phi$ for which a depression of the transmittance is expected as a consequence of spin-charge separation.

We find that these mass Ansatze can give an adequate description of the known standard model fermion masses.",hep,hep-ph,0
First application of combined isochronous and Schottky mass spectrometry: Half-lives of fully ionized 49Cr24+ and 53Fe26+ atoms,Lifetime measurements of b -decaying highly charged ions have been performed in the storage ring CSRe by applying the isochronous Schottky mass spectrometry. The fully ionized 49Cr and 53Fe ions were produced in projectile fragmentation of 58Ni primary beam and were stored in the CSRe tuned into the isochronous ion-optical mode. The new resonant Schottky detector was applied to monitor the intensities of stored uncooled 49Cr24+ and 53Fe26+ ions. The extracted half-lives T1/2(49Cr24+) = 44.0(27) min and T1/2(53Fe26+) = 8.47(19) min are in excellent agreement with the literature half-life values corrected for the disabled electron capture branchings.

Chimera Ising Walls in Forced Nonlocally Coupled Oscillators,"Nonlocally coupled oscillator systems can exhibit an exotic spatiotemporal structure called chimera, where the system splits into two groups of oscillators with sharp boundaries, one of which is phase-locked and the other is phase-randomized. Two examples of the chimera states are known: the first one appears in a ring of phase oscillators, and the second one is associated with the two-dimensional rotating spiral waves. In this article, we report yet another example of the chimera state that is associated with the so-called Ising walls in one-dimensional spatially extended systems, which is exhibited by a nonlocally coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with external forcing.",nlin,nlin.PS,Non-Perturbative Zero Modes in the Kraichnan Model for Turbulent Advection,The anomalous scaling behavior of the n-th order correlation functions ${\cal F}_n$ of the Kraichnan model of turbulent passive scalar advection is believed to be dominated by the homogeneous solutions (zero-modes) of the Kraichnan equation $\hat{\cal B}_n {\cal F}_n=0$. Previous analysis found zero-modes in perturbation theory in a small parameter.

Tellurium Hydrides at High Pressures: High-temperature Superconductors,"Observation of high-temperature superconductivity in sulfur hydrides at megabar pressures has generated an irresistible wave on searching for new superconductors in other compressed hydrogen-rich compounds. An immediate effort is towards exploration of the relevant candidate of tellurium hydrides, where tellurium is isoelectronic to sulfur but it has a heavier atomic mass and much weaker electronegativity. The hitherto unknown phase diagram of tellurium hydrides at high pressures was investigated by a first-principles swarm structure search. Four energetically stable and metallic stoichiometries of H4Te, H5Te2, HTe and HTe3 were uncovered above 140 GPa, showing a distinct potential energy map of tellurium hydrides from those in sulfur and selenium hydrides. The two hydrogen-rich H4Te and H5Te2 species adopt ionic structures containing exotic quasi-molecular H2 and linear H3 units, respectively. Strong electron-phonon couplings associated with the intermediate-frequency H-derived wagging and bending modes make them good superconductors with high Tc in the range of 46-104 K.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,Do Spherical Polyelectrolyte Brushes Interdigitate?,"The structure of spherical micelles of the diblock copolymer poly(styrene-block-acrylic acid) in water was investigated with small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and contrast matching.

Adatoms in graphene as a source of current polarization: Role of the local magnetic moment,"We theoretically investigate spin-resolved currents flowing in large-area graphene, with and without defects, doped with single atoms of noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) and 3d-transition metals (Mn,Fe,Co and Ni). We show that the presence of a local magnetic moment is a necessary but not sufficient condition to have a non zero current polarization. An essential requirement is the presence of spin-split localized levels near the Fermi energy that strongly hybridize with the graphene pi-bands. We also show that a gate potential can be used to tune the energy of these localized levels, leading to an external way to control the degree of spin-polarized current without the application of a magnetic field.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Anharmonic effects in the A15 compounds induced by sublattice distortions,"We demonstrate that elastic anomalies and lattice instabilities in the the A15 compounds are describable in terms of first-principles LDA electronic structure calculations.

Fighting the sign problem in a chiral random matrix model with contour deformations,"We studied integration contour deformations in the chiral random matrix theory of Stephanov with the goal of alleviating the finite-density sign problem. We considered simple ans\""atze for the deformed integration contours, and optimized their parameters. We find that optimization of a single parameter manages to considerably improve on the severity of the sign problem. We show numerical evidence that the improvement achieved is exponential in the degrees of freedom of the system, i.e., the size of the random matrix. We also compare the optimization method with contour deformations coming from the holomorphic flow equations.",hep,hep-lat,Higgs Searches Beyond the Standard Model,"While the existence of a Higgs boson with a mass near 125 GeV has been clearly established, the detailed structure of the entire Higgs sector is yet unclear. Besides the Standard Model interpretation, various possibilities for extended Higgs sectors are being considered.

Alternatively, more generic Two-Higgs Doublet models (2HDM) are used for the interpretation of results. The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model (NMSSM) has a more complex Higgs sector with seven physical states. Also exotic Higgs bosons decaying to invisible final states are considered.

Whitham deformations partially saturating the modulational instability in the nonlinear Schrodinger equation,In the framework of Gurevich and Pitaevskii approach [1] we construct modulated by Whitham [2] solution of nonlinear Shrodinger (NS) equation partially saturating the modulational instability.

The main tool of our investigation is the notion of equivalence of conservation laws with respect to the equivalence groups. That is why, for the class under consideration we first construct the usual equivalence group $G^{\sim}$ and the extended one $\hat G^{\sim}$ including transformations which are nonlocal with respect to arbitrary elements. The extended equivalence group $\hat G^{\sim}$ has interesting structure since it contains a non-trivial subgroup of gauge equivalence transformations. Then, using the most direct method, we carry out two classifications of local conservation laws up to equivalence relations generated by $G^{\sim}$ and $\hat G^{\sim}$, respectively. Equivalence with respect to $\hat G^{\sim}$ plays the major role for simple and clear formulation of the final results.",nlin,nlin.SI,0
Finite-temperature conductance of strongly interacting quantum wire with a nuclear spin order,"We study the temperature dependence of the electrical conductance of a clean strongly interacting quantum wire in the presence of a helical nuclear spin order. The nuclear spin helix opens a temperature-dependent partial gap in the electron spectrum. Using a bosonization framework we describe the gapped electron modes by sine-Gordon-like kinks. We predict an internal resistivity caused by an Ohmic-like friction these kinks experience via interacting with gapless excitations. As a result, the conductance rises from $G=e^2/h$ at temperatures below the critical temperature when nuclear spins are fully polarized to $G=2e^2/h$ at higher temperatures when the order is destroyed, featuring a relatively wide plateau in the intermediate regime. The theoretical results are compared with the experimental data for GaAs quantum wires obtained recently by Scheller et al. [Phys. Rev.

Usually, such a kind of anomalous topological semimetallic phase in real materials is unstable where any amount of disorder can drive it into a diffusive metal and destroy the half-integer quantized Hall conductivity as an indicator of parity anomaly. Here, based on low-energy effective model, we propose an anisotropic Dirac semimetal which explicitly breaks time-reversal symmetry and carries a half-integer quantized Hall conductivity. This topological semimetallic phase can be realized on a deformed honeycomb lattice subjected to a magnetic flux. Moreover, we perceptively investigate the disorder correction to the Hall conductivity. The results show that the effects of disorder can be strongly suppressed and thereby the nearly half-integer quantization of Hall conductivity can exist in a wide region of disorder, indicating that our proposed anisotropic Dirac semimetal is an exciting platform to investigate the parity anomaly phenomena.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,0
Precise prediction for the Higgs-Boson Masses in the $\mu\nu$SSM,"The $\mu\nu$SSM is a simple supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (SM) capable of predicting neutrino physics in agreement with experiment. In this paper we perform the complete one-loop renormalization of the neutral scalar sector of the $\mu\nu$SSM with one generation of right-handed neutrinos in a mixed on-shell/$\overline{\mathrm{DR}}$ scheme. The renormalization procedure is discussed in detail, emphasizing conceptual differences to the minimal (MSSM) and next-to-minimal (NMSSM) supersymmetric standard model regarding the field renormalization and the treatment of non-flavor-diagonal soft mass parameters, which have their origin in the breaking of $R$-parity in the $\mu\nu$SSM. We calculate the full one-loop corrections to the neutral scalar masses of the $\mu\nu$SSM. The one-loop contributions are supplemented by available MSSM higher-order corrections. We obtain numerical results for a SM-like Higgs boson mass consistent with experimental bounds. We compare our results to predictions in the NMSSM to obtain a measure for the significance of genuine $\mu\nu$SSM-like contributions. We only find minor corrections due to the smallness of the neutrino Yukawa couplings, indicating that the Higgs boson mass calculations in the $\mu\nu$SSM are at the same level of accuracy as in the NMSSM. Finally we show that the $\mu\nu$SSM can accomodate a Higgs boson that could explain an excess of $\gamma\gamma$ events at $\sim 96\, \mathrm{GeV}$ as reported by CMS, as well as the $2\,\sigma$ excess of $b \bar{b}$ events observed at LEP at a similar mass scale.",hep,hep-ph,Thermalization of mini-jets in a quark-gluon plasma,"We present the complete physical picture for the evolution of a high-energy jet propagating through a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by analytical and numerical investigation of thermalization of the soft components of the jet. Our results support the following physical picture: the leading particle emits a significant number of mini-jets which promptly evolve via multiple branching and thus degrade into a myriad of soft gluons, with energies of the order of the medium temperature $T$. Via elastic collisions with the medium constituents, these soft gluons relax to local thermal equilibrium with the plasma over a time scale which is considerably shorter than the typical lifetime of the mini-jet. The thermalized gluons form a tail which lags behind the hard components of the jet. Together with the background QGP, they behave hydrodynamically.",hep,hep-ex,0
Faddeev calculation of 3 alpha and alpha alpha Lambda systems using alpha alpha resonating-group method kernel,"We carry out Faddeev calculations of three-alpha (3 alpha) and two-alpha plus Lambda (alpha alpha Lambda) systems, using two-cluster resonating-group method kernels. The input includes an effective two-nucleon force for the alpha alpha resonating-group method and a new effective Lambda N force for the Lambda alpha interaction. The latter force is a simple two-range Gaussian potential for each spin-singlet and triplet state, generated from the phase-shift behavior of the quark-model hyperon-nucleon interaction, fss2, by using an inversion method based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Owing to the exact treatment of the Pauli-forbidden states between the clusters, the present three-cluster Faddeev formalism can describe the mutually related, alpha alpha, 3 alpha and alpha alpha Lambda systems, in terms of a unique set of the baryon-baryon interactions. For the three-range Minnesota force which describes the alpha alpha phase shifts quite accurately, the ground-state and excitation energies of 9Be Lambda are reproduced within 100 - 200 keV accuracy.",nucl,nucl-th,"Systematic Extraction of Spectroscopic Factors from 12C(d,p)13C and 13C(p,d)12C Reactions","Existing measurements of the angular distributions of the ground-state to ground-state transitions of the 12C(d,p)13C and 13C(p,d)12C neutron-transfer reactions have been analyzed systematically using the Johnson-Soper adiabatic and distorted-wave theories. When using a consistent set of physical inputs the deduced spectroscopic factors are consistent to within 20% for incident deuteron energies from 6 to 60 MeV. By contrast, original analyses of many of these data quoted spectroscopic factors that differed by up to a factor of five.

Elliptical instability in hot Jupiter systems,"Several studies have already considered the influence of tides on the evolution of systems composed of a star and a close-in companion to tentatively explain different observations such as the spin-up of some stars with hot Jupiters, the radius anomaly of short orbital period planets and the synchronization or quasi-synchronization of the stellar spin in some extreme cases. However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal dissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the so-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems, explaining some systematic features present in the observations. This hydrodynamic instability, arising in rotating flows with elliptical streamlines, is suspected to be present in both planet and star of such systems, which are elliptically deformed by tides. The presence and the influence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot Jupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical simulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated to the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of ad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of compressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the incompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability to grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized latitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the fluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a centrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an incompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability. Finally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the main tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and misaligned stars is consistent with current data.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Discovery of periodic dips in the brightest hard X-ray source of M31 with EXTraS,"We performed a search for eclipsing and dipping sources in the archive of the EXTraS project - a systematic characterization of the temporal behaviour of XMM-Newton point sources.

A systematic analysis of XMM-Newton observations revealed 13 dips in 40 observations (total exposure time $\sim$0.8 Ms). Among them, four observations show two dips, separated by $\sim$4.01 hr. Dip depths and durations are variable. The dips occur only during low-luminosity states (L$_{0.2-12}<1\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$), while the source reaches L$_{0.2-12}\sim2.8\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We propose this system to be a new dipping Low-Mass X-ray Binary in M31 seen at high inclination (60$^{\circ}$-80$^{\circ}$), the observed dipping periodicity is the orbital period of the system. A blue HST source within the Chandra error circle is the most likely optical counterpart of the accretion disk.

Study of irregular dynamics in an economic model: attractor localization and Lyapunov exponents,"Cyclicity and instability inherent in the economy can manifest themselves in irregular fluctuations, including chaotic ones, which significantly reduces the accuracy of forecasting the dynamics of the economic system in the long run. We focus on an approach, associated with the identification of a deterministic endogenous mechanism of irregular fluctuations in the economy. Using of a mid-size firm model as an example, we demonstrate the use of effective analytical and numerical procedures for calculating the quantitative characteristics of its irregular limiting dynamics based on Lyapunov exponents, such as dimension and entropy. We use an analytical approach for localization of a global attractor and study limiting dynamics of the model. We estimate the Lyapunov exponents and get the exact formula for the Lyapunov dimension of the global attractor of this model analytically. With the help of delayed feedback control (DFC), the possibility of transition from irregular limiting dynamics to regular periodic dynamics is shown to solve the problem of reliable forecasting. At the same time, we demonstrate the complexity and ambiguity of applying numerical procedures to calculate the Lyapunov dimension along different trajectories of the global attractor, including unstable periodic orbits (UPOs).",nlin,nlin.CD,"Cumulant Dynamics of a Population under Multiplicative Selection, Mutation and Drift","We revisit the classical population genetics model of a population evolving under multiplicative selection, mutation and drift. The number of beneficial alleles in a multi-locus system can be considered a trait under exponential selection. Equations of motion are derived for the cumulants of the trait distribution in the diffusion limit and under the assumption of linkage equilibrium. Because of the additive nature of cumulants, this reduces to the problem of determining equations of motion for the expected allele distribution cumulants at each locus. The cumulant equations form an infinite dimensional linear system and in an authored appendix Adam Prugel-Bennett provides a closed form expression for these equations. We derive approximate solutions which are shown to describe the dynamics well for a broad range of parameters. In particular, we introduce two approximate analytical solutions: (1) Perturbation theory is used to solve the dynamics for weak selection and arbitrary mutation rate. The resulting expansion for the system's eigenvalues reduces to the known diffusion theory results for the limiting cases with either mutation or selection absent. (2) For low mutation rates we observe a separation of time-scales between the slowest mode and the rest which allows us to develop an approximate analytical solution for the dominant slow mode. The solution is consistent with the perturbation theory result and provides a good approximation for much stronger selection intensities.",nlin,nlin.AO,0
Hidden velocity ordering in dense suspensions of self-propelled disks,"Recent studies of the phase diagram for spherical, purely repulsive, active particles established the existence of a transition from a liquid-like to a solid-like phase analogous to the one observed in colloidal systems at thermal equilibrium, in particular in two dimensions an intermediate hexatic phase is observed. Here, we present evidence that the active dense phases (solid, hexatic and liquid) exhibit interesting dynamical anomalies. First, we unveil the growth - with density and activity - of ordered domains where the particles' velocities align in parallel or vortex-like patches. Second, when activity is strong, the spatial distribution of kinetic energy becomes heterogeneous with high energy regions correlated to defects of the crystalline structure. This spatial heterogeneity is accompanied by temporal intermittency, with sudden peaks in the time-series of kinetic energy. The observed dynamical anomalies are not present in a dense equilibrium system and cannot be detected by considering only the structural properties of the system.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Instability of insulating states in optical lattices due to collective phonon excitations,"The role of collective phonon excitations on the properties of cold atoms in optical lattices is investigated. These phonon excitations are collective excitations, whose appearance is caused by intersite atomic interactions correlating the atoms, and they do not arise without such interactions. These collective excitations should not be confused with lattice vibrations produced by an external force. No such a force is assumed. But the considered phonons are purely self-organized collective excitations, characterizing atomic oscillations around lattice sites, due to intersite atomic interactions. It is shown that these excitations can essentially influence the possibility of atoms to be localized. The states that would be insulating in the absence of phonon excitations can become delocalized when these excitations are taken into account. This concerns long-range as well as local atomic interactions. To characterize the region of stability, the Lindemann criterion is used.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,0
Early science with Korean VLBI network: the QCAL-1 43GHz calibrator survey,"This paper presents the catalog of correlated flux densities in three ranges of baseline projection lengths of 637 sources from a 43 GHz (Q-band) survey observed with the Korean VLBI Network. Of them, 623 sources have not been observed before at Q-band with VLBI. The goal of this work in the early science phase of the new VLBI array is twofold: to evaluate the performance of the new instrument that operates in a frequency range of 22-129 GHz and to build a list of objects that can be used as targets and as calibrators. We have observed the list of 799 target sources with declinations down to -40 degrees. Among them, 724 were observed before with VLBI at 22 GHz and had correlated flux densities greater than 200 mJy. The overall detection rate is 78%. The detection limit, defined as the minimum flux density for a source to be detected with 90% probability in a single observation, was in a range of 115-180 mJy depending on declination. However, some sources as weak as 70 mJy have been detected. Of 623 detected sources, 33 objects are detected for the first time in VLBI mode. We determined their coordinates with the median formal uncertainty 20 mas. The results of this work set the basis for future efforts to build the complete flux-limited sample of extragalactic sources at frequencies 22 GHz and higher at 3/4 of the celestial sphere.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,The destiny of Dark Matter,"The majority of baryons, which account for $15\%$ of the matter in the Universe, will end their lives as carbon and oxygen inside cold black dwarfs. Dark matter (DM) makes up the remaining $85\%$ of the matter in the universe, however, the fate of DM is unknown. Here we show that the destiny of purely gravitationally interacting DM particles follows one of two possible routes. The first possible route, the ""radiation-destiny"" scenario, is that massive DM particles lose sufficient energy through gravitational radiation causing them to spiral into a supermassive black hole that ultimately disappears through Hawking radiation. The second possible route, the ""drifting-alone"" destiny, applies to lighter DM particles, where only the central DM halo region spirals into the central BH which is then Hawking radiated away.

Variable O VI and N V Emission from the X-ray Binary LMC X-3: Heating of the Black Hole Companion,"Based on high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with FUSE and COS, we present new detections of O VI and N V emission from the black-hole X-ray binary (XRB) system LMC X-3. We also update the ephemeris of the XRB using recent radial velocity measurements obtained with the echelle spectrograph on the Magellan-Clay telescope. We observe significant velocity variability of the UV emission, and we find that the O VI and N V emission velocities follow the optical velocity curve of the XRB. Moreover, the O VI and N V intensities regularly decrease between binary phase = 0.5 and 1.0, which suggests that the source of the UV emission is increasingly occulted as the B star in the XRB moves from superior to inferior conjunction. These trends suggest that illumination of the B-star atmosphere by the intense X-ray emission from the accreting black hole creates a hot spot on one side of the B star, and this hot spot is the origin of the O VI and N V emission. However, the velocity semiamplitude of the ultraviolet emission, K_{UV}~180 km/s, is lower than the optical semiamplitude; this difference could be due to rotation of the B star. If our hypothesis about the origin of the highly ionized emission is correct, then careful analysis of the emission occultation could, in principle, constrain the inclination of the XRB and the mass of the black hole.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Pulsar Candidate Classification Using A Computer Vision Method Combining with Convolution and Attention,"Artificial intelligence methods are indispensable to identifying pulsars from large amounts of candidates.

The physical basis of self-organization of the mammalian oocyte spindle,"To prepare gametes with the appropriate number of chromosomes, mammalian oocytes undergo two sequential cell divisions. During each division, a large, long-lived, microtubule-based organelle called the meiotic spindle assembles around condensed chromosomes. Although meiotic spindles have been intensively studied for several decades, as force-generating mechanical objects, they remain very poorly understood. In materials physics, coarse-grained theories have been essential in understanding the large-scale behavior of systems composed of many interacting particles. It is unclear, however, if this approach can succeed in capturing the properties of active, biochemically complex, living materials like the spindle. Here, we show that a class of models based on nematic liquid crystal theory can describe important aspects of the organelle-scale structure and dynamics of spindles in living mouse oocytes. Using our models to interpret quantitative polarization microscopy data, we measure for the first time material properties relating to stress propagation in living oocytes, including the nematic diffusivities corresponding to splay and bend deformations. Unlike the reconstituted amphibian spindles that were previously studied in vitro, nematic elastic stress is exponentially screened in the microtubule network of living mammalian oocytes, with a screening length of order one micron. This observation can be explained by the relatively high volume fraction of embedded chromosomes in mammalian meiotic spindles, which cause long voids in the microtubule network and so disrupt orientational stress propagation.",physics,physics.bio-ph,Global Earthquake Prediction Systems,"Terra Seismic can predict most major earthquakes (M6.2 or greater) at least 2 - 5 months before they will strike.

To identify abnormalities and make predictions, Terra Seismic applies various methodologies, including satellite remote sensing methods and data from ground-based instruments. We currently process terabytes of information daily, and use more than 80 different multiparameter prediction systems. Alerts are issued if the abnormalities are confirmed by at least five different systems. We observed that geophysical patterns of earthquake development and stress accumulation are generally the same for all key seismic regions.

Biweekly maps of SMADI were obtained from year 2010 to 2015 over all agricultural areas on Earth. The SMADI time-series were compared with state-of-the-art drought indices over the Iberian Peninsula.

Some preliminary tests were also made over the continental United States using the Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI), with very encouraging results regarding the spatial occurrence of droughts during summer seasons.

Dynamics of clade diversification on the morphological hypercube,"Understanding the relationship between taxonomic and morphological changes is important in identifying the reasons for accelerated morphological diversification early in the history of animal phyla. Here, a simple general model describing the joint dynamics of taxonomic diversity and morphological disparity is presented and applied to the data on the diversification of blastozoans. I show that the observed patterns of deceleration in clade diversification can be explicable in terms of the geometric structure of the morphospace and the effects of extinction and speciation on morphological disparity without invoking major declines in the size of morphological transitions or taxonomic turnover rates. The model allows testing of hypotheses about patterns of diversification and estimation of rates of morphological evolution. In the case of blastozoans, I find no evidence that major changes in evolutionary rates and mechanisms are responsible for the deceleration of morphological diversification seen during the period of this clade's expansion. At the same time, there is evidence for a moderate decline in overall rates of morphological diversification concordant with a major change (from positive to negative values) in the clade's growth rate.",nlin,nlin.AO,Spatiotemporal dissipative solitons and vortices in a multi-transverse-mode fiber laser,"We introduce a model for spatiotemporal modelocking in multimode fiber lasers, which is based on the (3+1)-dimensional cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (cGLE) with conservative and dissipative nonlinearities and a 2-dimensional transverse trapping potential. Systematic numerical analysis reveals a variety of stable nonlinear modes, including stable fundamental solitons and breathers, as well as solitary vortices with winding number $n=1$, while vortices with $n=2$ are unstable, splitting into persistently rotating bound states of two unitary vortices. A characteristic feature of the system is bistability between the fundamental and vortex spatiotemporal solitons.",nlin,nlin.PS,0
On the supersymmetric nonlinear evolution equations,Supersymmetrization of a nonlinear evolution equation in which the bosonic equation is independent of the fermionic variable and the system is linear in fermionic field goes by the name B-supersymmetrization. This special type of supersymmetrization plays a role in superstring theory. We provide B-supersymmetric extension of a number of quasilinear and fully nonlinear evolution equations and find that the supersymmetric system follows from the usual action principle while the bosonic and fermionic equations are individually non Lagrangian in the field variable. We point out that B-supersymmetrization can also be realized using a generalized Noetherian symmetry such that the resulting set of Lagrangian symmetries coincides with symmetries of the bosonic field equations. This observation provides a basis to associate the bosonic and fermionic fields with the terms of bright and dark solitons. The interpretation sought by us has its origin in the classic work of Bateman who introduced a reverse-time system with negative friction to bring the linear dissipative systems within the framework of variational principle.,nlin,nlin.SI,Chimera states and the interplay between initial conditions and non-local coupling,"Chimera states are complex spatio-temporal patterns that consist of coexisting domains of coherent and incoherent dynamics. We study chimera states in a network of non-locally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. We investigate the impact of initial conditions in combination with non-local coupling. Based on an analytical argument, we show how the coupling phase and the coupling strength are linked to the occurrence of chimera states, flipped profiles of the mean phase velocity, and the transition from a phase- to an amplitude-mediated chimera state.",nlin,nlin.AO,0
Correlation Functions and Cumulants in Elliptic Flow Analysis,"We consider various methods of flow analysis in heavy ion collisions and compare experimental data on corresponding observables to the predictions of our saturation model proposed earlier. We demonstrate that, due to the nature of the standard flow analysis, azimuthal distribution of particles with respect to reaction plane determined from the second order harmonics should always be proportional to $\cos 2(\phi-\Psi_R)$ independent of the physical origin of particle correlations (flow or non-flow). The amplitude of this distribution is always physical and proportional to $v_2$. Two-particle correlations analysis is therefore a more reliable way of extracting the shape of physical azimuthal anisotropy. We demonstrate that two-particle correlation functions generated in our minijet model of particle production are in good agreement with the data reported by PHENIX. We discuss the role of non-flow correlations in the cumulant flow analysis and demonstrate using a simple example that if the flow is weak, higher order cumulants analysis does not significantly reduce the contribution of non-flow correlations to elliptic flow observable $v_2$ in RHIC data.",nucl,nucl-th,Process-independent effective coupling and the pion structure function,"We sketch the calculation of the pion structure functions within the DSE framework, following two alternative albeit consistent approaches, and discuss then their QCD evolution, the running driven by an effective charge, from a hadronic scale up to any larger one accessible to experiment.",nucl,nucl-ex,0
First demonstration of OH suppression in a high efficiency near-infrared spectrograph,"Ground-based near-infrared astronomy is severely hampered by the forest of atmospheric emission lines resulting from the rovibrational decay of OH molecules in the upper atmosphere. The extreme brightness of these lines, as well as their spatial and temporal variability, makes accurate sky subtraction difficult. Selectively filtering these lines with OH suppression instruments has been a long standing goal for near-infrared spectroscopy. We have shown previously the efficacy of fibre Bragg gratings combined with photonic lanterns for achieving OH suppression. Here we report on PRAXIS, a unique near-infrared spectrograph that is optimised for OH suppression with fibre Bragg gratings. We show for the first time that OH suppression (of any kind) is possible with high overall throughput (18 per cent end-to-end), and provide examples of the relative benefits of OH suppression.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,The Luminosity Function of Red Supergiants in M31,"The mass-loss rates of red supergiant stars (RSGs) are poorly constrained by direct measurements, and yet the subsequent evolution of these stars depends critically on how much mass is lost during the RSG phase. In 2012 the Geneva evolutionary group updated their mass-loss prescription for RSGs with the result that a 20 solar mass star now loses 10x more mass during the RSG phase than in the older models. Thus, higher mass RSGs evolve back through a second yellow supergiant phase rather than exploding as Type II-P supernovae, in accord with recent observations (the so-called ""RSG Problem""). Still, even much larger mass-loss rates during the RSG phase cannot be ruled out by direct measurements of their current dust-production rates, as such mass-loss is episodic. Here we test the models by deriving a luminosity function for RSGs in the nearby spiral galaxy M31 which is sensitive to the total mass loss during the RSG phase. We carefully separate RSGs from asymptotic giant branch stars in the color-magnitude diagram following the recent method exploited by Yang and collaborators in their Small Magellanic Cloud studies. Comparing our resulting luminosity function to that predicted by the evolutionary models shows that the new prescription for RSG mass-loss does an excellent job of matching the observations, and we can readily rule out significantly larger values.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0

A new type of cooperative behavior is found: sublattice synchronization. Although the units of one sublattice are not directly coupled to each other, they completely synchronize without time delay. The chaotic trajectories of different sublattices are only weakly correlated but not related by generalized synchronization. Nevertheless, the trajectory of one sublattice is predictable from the complete trajectory of the other one. The spectra of Lyapunov exponents are calculated analytically in the limit of infinite delay times, and phase diagrams are derived for different topologies.",nlin,nlin.CD,0

Parametrization of the Charge-Carrier Mobility in Organic Disordered Semiconductors. APAE against EGDM,"An appropriately parameterized compact analytical equation (APAE) is suggested to account for charge carrier mobility in organic disordered semiconductors (ODSs). This equation correctly reproduces the effects of temperature $T$, carrier concentration $n$, and electric field $F$ on the carrier mobility $\mu(T,F,n)$, as evidenced by comparison with analytical theories and Monte Carlo simulations. The set of material parameters responsible for charge transport is proven to be at varience to those used in the so-called extended Gaussian disorder model (EGDM) approach, which is widely exploited in commercially distributed device--simulation algorithms. While EGDM is only valid for cubic lattices with a specific choice of parameters, APAE describes charge transport in systems with spatial disorder in a wide range of parameters. APAE is user-friendly and, thus, suitable for incorporation into device-simulation algorithms.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Experimental proof of a structural origin for the shadow Fermi surface in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$,"By combining surprising new results from a full polarization analysis of nodal angle-resolved photoemission data from pristine and modulation-free Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ with structural information from LEED and {\it ab initio} one-step photoemission simulations, we prove that the shadow Fermi surface in these systems has structural origin, being due to orthorhombic distortions from tetragonal symmetry present in both surface and bulk.

Recently, the experimental setup of the NA61/SHINE experiment was supplemented with a Vertex Detector which was motivated by the importance and the possibility of the first direct measurements of open charm meson production in heavy ion collisions at SPS energies. First test data taken in December 2016 on Pb+Pb collisions at 150$A$ GeV/$c$ allowed to validate the general concept of D$^0$ meson detection via its D$^0 \to \pi^+ + K^-$ decay channel and delivered a first indication of open charm production.

Bose-Einstein condensates in multiple well potentials from a variational path integral,"We apply a path integral variational approach to obtain analytical expressions for condensate wave functions of an ultracold, interacting trapped Bose gases. As in many recent experiments, the particles are confined in a 1D or 3D harmonic oscillator trap which is superimposed by a periodic potential in one direction. Based on the first order cumulant expansion with respect to a harmonic trial action, and emplyoing a mean-field approximation, optimal variational parameters are obtained by minimizing an analytical expression for the ground state energy. Our largely analytical results for energy and condensate wave function are in good agreement with fully numerical calculations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Dynamics and physical interpretation of quasi-stationary states in systems with long-range interactions,"Although the Vlasov equation is used as a good approximation for a sufficiently large $N$, Braun and Hepp have showed that the time evolution of the one particle distribution function of a $N$ particle classical Hamiltonian system with long range interactions satisfies the Vlasov equation in the limit of infinite $N$. Here we rederive this result using a different approach allowing a discussion of the role of inter-particle correlations on the system dynamics. Otherwise for finite N collisional corrections must be introduced. This has allowed the a quite comprehensive study of the Quasi Stationary States (QSS) but many aspects of the physical interpretations of these states remain unclear. In this paper a proper definition of timescale for long time evolution is discussed and several numerical results are presented, for different values of $N$. Previous reports indicates that the lifetimes of the QSS scale as $N^{1.7}$ or even the system properties scales with $\exp(N)$. However, preliminary results presented here shows indicates that time scale goes as $N^2$ for a different type of initial condition. We also discuss how the form of the inter-particle potential determines the convergence of the $N$-particle dynamics to the Vlasov equation. The results are obtained in the context of following models: the Hamiltonian Mean Field, the Self Gravitating Ring Model, and a 2-D Systems of Gravitating Particles. We have also provided information of the validity of the Vlasov equation for finite $N$, i. e.\ how the dynamics converges to the mean-field (Vlasov) description as $N$ increases and how inter-particle correlations arise.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,0
Long-time unbreaking correlations in the large number of degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system,A behaviour of molecular cluster with Lennard-Jones potential of interactions as Hamiltonian system is studied by computer simulation (molecular dynamics method).

In numerical simulations beyond the instabilities we observe replication of pulses (backfiring) resulting in complex periodic or spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics as well as modulated traveling pulses. We approximate the linear stability of traveling pulses through computations in a finite albeit large domain with periodic boundary conditions. The critical eigenmodes at the onset of the instabilities are related to the resulting spatiotemporal dynamics and act upon the back of the pulses. The first scenario has been analyzed earlier for high excitability resp. low excitation threshold: it involves the collision of a stable pulse branch with an unstable pulse branch in a so called T-point.,nlin,nlin.PS,0
Beyond the Quasi-Particle picture in Nuclear Matter calculations using Green's function techniques,"Widths of low-lying states in nuclei are of the order of 30 MeV. These large widths are a consequence of the strong interactions leading to a strongly correlated many body system at the typical densities of nuclear matter. Nevertheless ""traditional"" Brueckner calculations treat these states as quasiparticles i.e. with spectral functions of zero widths. The width is related to the imaginary part of the selfenergy and is included selfconsistently in an extension of the Brueckner theory using T-matrix and Green's function techniques. A more general formulation applicable also to non-equilibrium systems is contained in the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equations while still maintaining the basic many-body techniques of Bruecknet theory. In the present work the two-time KB-equations are time-stepped along the imaginary time-axis to calculate the binding energy of nuclear matter as a function of density, including the spectral widths self-consistently. These zero temperature calculations are compared with quasi-particle calculations. The inclusion of the self-consistent widths are found to add several MeV to the binding. The spectral widths are due to the long-ranged correlations. Short-ranged correlations decrease rather than increase the binding. The metod is easily extended to non-zero temperatures where the importance of the widths are expected to increase.",nucl,nucl-th,Simulations of the nEDM@SNS light collection system efficiency,"A system for collecting the scintillation light produced by the capture process of ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) on polarized $^{3}$He is discussed and results from simulations of its performance are presented.

Decomposition of flow and nonflow in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"We propose a method to separate \Delta\eta-dependent and \Delta\eta-independent azimuthal correlations using two- and four-particle cumulants between pseudo-rapidity (\eta) bins in symmetric heavy-ion collisions. The \Delta\eta-independent correlation may be dominated by harmonic flows, a global correlation to the common collision geometry. The \Delta\eta-dependent correlation can be identified as nonflow, particle correlations unrelated to the common geometry. Our method exploits the \eta symmetry of the average harmonic flows and is ""data-driven."" We use the AMPT and HIJING event generators to illustrate our method. We discuss the decomposed \Delta\eta-independent and \Delta\eta-dependent correlations regarding flow and nonflow in the models.",nucl,nucl-th,Projectile fragmentation reactions and production of nuclei near the neutron drip-line,"The reaction mechanism of projectile fragmentation at intermediate energies has been investigated observing the target dependence of the production cross sections of very neutron-rich nuclei.

By measurement of fragment momentum distribution, a parabolic mass dependence of momentum peak shift was observed in the results of both targets, and a phenomenon of light-fragment acceleration was found only in the Be-target data. The analysis of production cross sections revealed an obvious enhancement of the target dependence except target size effect when the neutron excess is increased. This result implies the breakdown of factorization (BOF) of production cross sections for very neutron-rich nuclei near the drip line.",nucl,nucl-ex,0
The Thresher: Lucky Imaging without the Waste,"In traditional lucky imaging (TLI), many consecutive images of the same scene are taken with a high frame-rate camera, and all but the sharpest images are discarded before constructing the final shift-and-add image. Here we present an alternative image analysis pipeline -- The Thresher -- for these kinds of data, based on online multi-frame blind deconvolution. It makes use of all available data to obtain a best estimate of the astronomical scene in the context of reasonable computational limits; it does not require prior estimates of the point-spread functions in the images, or knowledge of point sources in the scene that could provide such estimates. Most importantly, the scene it aims to return is the optimum of a justified scalar objective based on the likelihood function. Because it uses the full set of images in the stack, The Thresher outperforms TLI in signal-to-noise; as it accounts for the individual-frame PSFs, it does this without loss of angular resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on both simulated data and real Electron-Multiplying CCD images obtained at the Danish 1.54m telescope (hosted by ESO, La Silla). We also explore the current limitations of the algorithm, and find that for the choice of image model presented here, non-linearities in flux are introduced into the returned scene.

We measure cluster orientations in optical based on the projected distribution of member galaxies and in X-ray by fitting the morphology of intra-cluster medium (ICM). Cluster orientations determined in the two wavelengths are generally consistent. The orientation alignment between BCGs and host clusters is confirmed and more significant than previous works. We find that BCGs are more aligned with cluster orientations measured in X-ray than those from optical data. Clusters with a brighter BCG generally show a stronger alignment. We argue that the detected redshift evolution of the alignment is probably caused by observational bias rather than intrinsic evolution. The alignment is not related to the ellipticity of BCGs, and the richness, ellipticity and dynamical state of host clusters. The strong alignment between BCGs and morphology of ICMs may be the consequence of the co-evolution between the central massive galaxy and host clusters.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
Evaluating links through spectral decomposition,"Spectral decomposition has been rarely used to investigate complex networks.

It is also showed that the spectral-based attacks have special effect in affecting the transitivity of the networks.",physics,physics.soc-ph,SIR-HUXt -- a particle filter data assimilation scheme for assimilating CME time-elongation profiles,"We present the development of SIR-HUXt, the integration of a sequential importance resampling (SIR) data assimilation scheme with the HUXt solar wind model. SIR-HUXt is designed to assimilate the time-elongation profiles of CME fronts in the low heliosphere, such as those typically extracted from heliospheric imager data returned by the STEREO, Parker Solar Probe, and Solar Orbiter missions. We use Observing System Simulation Experiments to explore the performance of SIR-HUXt for a simple synthetic CME scenario of a fully Earth directed CME flowing through a uniform ambient solar wind, where the CME is initialised with the average observed CME speed and width. These experiments are performed for a range of observer locations, from 20 deg to 90 deg behind Earth, spanning the L5 point where ESA's future Vigil space weather monitor will return heliospheric imager data for operational space weather forecasting. We show that SIR-HUXt performs well at constraining the CME speed, and has some success at constraining the CME longitude. The CME width is largely unconstrained by the SIR-HUXt assimilations, and more experiments are required to determine if this is due to this specific CME scenario, or is a general feature of assimilating time-elongation profiles. Rank-histograms suggest that the SIR-HUXt ensembles are well calibrated, with no clear indications of bias or under/over dispersion. Improved constraints on the initial CME speed lead directly to improvements in the CME transit time to Earth and arrival speed. For an observer in the L5 region, SIR-HUXt returned a 69% reduction in the CME transit time uncertainty, and a 63% reduction in the arrival speed uncertainty. This suggests SIR-HUXt has potential to improve the real-world representivity of HUXt simulations, and therefore has potential to reduce the uncertainty of CME arrival time hindcasts and forecasts.",physics,physics.space-ph,0
Double Helicity Asymmetry in $\pi^{0}$ Production at Midrapidity in Polarized $p+p$ Collisions at $\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV,"PHENIX measurements are presented for the cross-section and double-helicity asymmetry ($A_{LL}$) of inclusive $\pi^{0}$ production ($A_{LL}^{\pi^{0}}$) at midrapidity from $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV from data taken in 2012 and 2013 at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculation agrees excellently with the presented cross-section result. The $A_{LL}^{\pi^{0}}$ follows an increasingly positive asymmetry as functions of $p_{T}$ and $\sqrt{s}$ at the fixed $x_{T}$. The latest global analysis results, which support the positive spin contribution of gluon ($\Delta{}G$), agrees excellently with the presented asymmetry result. The asymmetry result extends the experimental sensitivity to the previously unexplored $x$ region down to $x\sim0.01$ and provides additional constraints on $\Delta{}G$.",nucl,nucl-ex,Three-Body Unitary Coupled-Channel Analysis on $\eta(1405/1475)$,"The recent BESIII data on $J/\psi\to\gamma(K_SK_S\pi^0)$, which is significantly more precise than earlier $\eta(1405/1475)$-related data, enables quantitative discussions on $\eta(1405/1475)$ at the previously unreachable level. We conduct a three-body unitary coupled-channel analysis of experimental Monte-Carlo outputs for radiative $J/\psi$ decays via $\eta(1405/1475)$: $K_SK_S\pi^0$ Dalitz plot distributions from the BESIII, and branching ratios of $\gamma(\eta\pi^+\pi^-)$ and $\gamma(\gamma\pi^+\pi^-)$ final states relative to that of $\gamma(K\bar{K}\pi)$. Our model systematically considers (multi-)loop diagrams and an associated triangle singularity, which is critical in making excellent predictions on $\eta(1405/1475)\to \pi\pi\pi$ lineshapes and branching ratios. The $\eta(1405/1475)$ pole locations are revealed for the first time. Two poles for $\eta(1405)$ are found on different Riemann sheets of the $K^*\bar{K}$ channel, while one pole for $\eta(1475)$. The $\eta(1405/1475)$ states are described with two bare states dressed by continuum states. The lower bare state would be an excited $\eta^\prime$, while the higher one could be an excited $\eta^{(\prime)}$, hybrid, glueball, or their mixture.

Signatures of valence fluctuations in CeCu2Si2 under high pressure,"Simultaneous resistivity and a.c.-specific heat measurements have been performed under pressure on single crystalline CeCu2Si2 to over 6 GPa in a hydrostatic helium pressure medium. A series of anomalies were observed around the pressure coinciding with a maximum in the superconducting critical temperature, $T_c^{max}$. These anomalies can be linked with an abrupt change of the Ce valence, and suggest a second quantum critical point at a pressure $P_v \simeq 4.5$ GPa, where critical valence fluctuations provide the superconducting pairing mechanism, as opposed to spin fluctuations at ambient pressure. Such a valence instability, and associated superconductivity, is predicted by an extended Anderson lattice model with Coulomb repulsion between the conduction and f-electrons. We explain the T-linear resistivity found at $P_v$ in this picture, while other anomalies found around $P_v$ can be qualitatively understood using the same model.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Mixed Bubbles in a one-dimensional Bose-Bose mixture,"We investigate a Bose-Bose mixture across the miscible-immiscible phase transition governed by quantum fluctuations in one dimension.

These bubbles form a pocket of miscibility, separated by one of the components. The collective excitations reflect the symmetry breaking resulting from the bubble formation.

Properties of the hadronic phase of the collision can be extracted from measurements of the suppression of resonance yields. A comparison of the transverse-momentum spectra of the phi(1020) meson and the proton (which have similar masses) can be used to study particle production mechanisms. Resonance measurements in pp collisions provide input for tuning QCD-inspired particle production models and serve as reference measurements for other collision systems. Measurements of resonances in p-Pb collisions allow nuclear effects in the absence of a hot and dense final state to be studied.

Spectrum in the presence of brane-localized mass on torus extra dimensions,"The lightest mass eigenvalue of a six-dimensional theory compactified on a torus is numerically evaluated in the presence of the brane-localized mass term. The dependence on the cutoff scale $\Lambda$ is non-negligible even when $\Lambda$ is two orders of magnitude above the compactification scale, which indicates that the mass eigenvalue is sensitive to the size of the brane, in contrast to five-dimensional theories. We obtain an approximate expression of the lightest mass in the thin brane limit, which well fits the numerical calculations, and clarifies its dependence on the torus moduli parameter $\tau$. We find that the lightest mass is typically much lighter than the compactification scale by an order of magnitude even in the limit of a large brane mass.",hep,hep-th,Constraining new physics in $b\to c\ell\nu$ transitions,"$B$ decays proceeding via $b\to c\ell\nu$ transitions with $\ell=e$ or $\mu$ are tree-level processes in the Standard Model. They are used to measure the CKM element $V_{cb}$, as such forming an important ingredient in the determination of e.g. the unitarity triangle; hence the question to which extent they can be affected by new physics contributions is important, specifically given the long-standing tension between $V_{cb}$ determinations from inclusive and exclusive decays and the significant hints for lepton flavour universality violation in $b\to c\tau\nu$ and $b\to s\ell\ell$ decays. We perform a comprehensive model-independent analysis of new physics in $b\to c\ell\nu$, considering all combinations of scalar, vector and tensor interactions occuring in single-mediator scenarios. We include for the first time differential distributions of $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ angular observables for this purpose. We show that these are valuable in constraining non-standard interactions. Specifically, the zero-recoil endpoint of the $B\to D\ell\nu$ spectrum is extremely sensitive to scalar currents, while the maximum-recoil endpoint of the $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ spectrum with transversely polarized $D^*$ is extremely sensitive to tensor currents. We also quantify the room for $e$-$\mu$ universality violation in $b\to c\ell\nu$ transitions, predicted by some models suggested to solve the $b\to c\tau\nu$ anomalies, from a global fit to $B\to D\ell\nu$ and $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ for the first time. Specific new physics models, corresponding to all possible tree-level mediators, are also discussed. As a side effect, we present $V_{cb}$ determinations from exclusive $B$ decays, both with frequentist and Bayesian statistics, leading to compatible results. The entire numerical analysis is based on open source code, allowing it to be easily adapted once new data or new form factors become available.",hep,hep-ex,0

Quark Pair Production in the Chiral Phase Transition,"The production of quarks and antiquarks during a sudden restoration of chiral symmetry, as it might occur in very energetic heavy ion collisions, is considered. If gluons are already present they can assist additively to the overall production: real gluons are partially decaying during such a chiral transition.

Using numerical simulation we measure the point-to-point $\kappa$ correlators in the ""Asqtad"" improved staggered fermion formulation. We analyze those correlators using the rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory (rS$\chi$PT), particular attention is paid to the bubble contribution. After chiral extrapolation, we obtain the physical $\kappa$ mass with $828\pm97$ MeV, which is within the recent experimental value $800\sim900$MeV. These numerical simulations are carried out with MILC 2+1 flavor gauge configurations at lattice spacing $a \approx 0.12$ fm.",hep,hep-lat,"More on Penrose Limit of AdS_4 x Q^{1,1,1}","We consider a Penrose limit of AdS_4 x Q^{1,1,1} that provides the pp-wave geometry equal to the one in the Penrose limit of AdS_4 x S^7. We expect that there exists a subsector of three dimensional N=2 dual gauge theory which has enhanced N=8 maximal supersymmetry.

Excitatory and inhibitory interactions affect the balance of chorus activity and energy efficiency in the aggregation of male frogs: Theoretical study using a hybrid dynamical model,"We theoretically study the role of excitatory and inhibitory interactions in the aggregations of male frogs. In most frogs, males produce sounds to attract conspecific females, which activates the calling behavior of other males and results in collective choruses. While the calling behavior is quite effective for mate attraction, it requires high energy consumption. In contrast, satellite behavior is an alternative mating strategy in which males deliberately stay silent in the vicinity of a calling male and attempt to intercept the female attracted to the caller, allowing the satellite males to drastically reduce their energy consumption while having a chance of mating. Here we propose a hybrid dynamical model in which male frogs autonomously switch among three behavioral states (i.e., calling state, resting state, and satellite state) due to the excitatory and inhibitory interactions. Numerical simulation of the proposed model demonstrated that (1) both collective choruses and satellite behavior can be reproduced and (2) the satellite males can prolong the energy depletion time of the whole aggregation while they split the maximum chorus activity into two levels over the whole chorusing period. This study theoretically highlights the trade-off between energy efficiency and chorus activity in the aggregations of male frogs driven by the multiple types of interactions.",nlin,nlin.AO,Energy Gradient Theory of Hydrodynamic Instability,"A new universal theory for flow instability and turbulent transition is proposed in this study. Flow instability and turbulence transition have been challenging subjects for fluid dynamics for a century. The critical condition of turbulent transition from theory and experiments differs largely from each other for Poiseuille flows. In this paper, a new mechanism of flow instability and turbulence transition is presented for parallel shear flows and the energy gradient theory of hydrodynamic instability is proposed. It is stated that the total energy gradient in the transverse direction and that in the streamwise direction of the main flow dominate the disturbance amplification or decay. A new dimensionless parameter K for characterizing flow instability is proposed for wall bounded shear flows, which is expressed as the ratio of the energy gradients in the two directions. It is thought that flow instability should first occur at the position of Kmax which may be the most dangerous position. This speculation is confirmed by Nishioka et al's experimental data. Comparison with experimental data for plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow indicates that the proposed idea is really valid. It is found that the turbulence transition takes place at a critical value of Kmax of about 385 for both plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow, below which no turbulence will occur regardless the disturbance. More studies show that the theory is also valid for plane Couette flows and Taylor-Couette flows between concentric rotating cylinders.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Specific viscosity of neutron-rich nuclear matter from a relaxation time approach,"The specific viscosity of neutron-rich nuclear matter is studied from the relaxation time approach using an isospin- and momentum-dependent interaction and the nucleon-nucleon cross sections taken as those from the experimental data modified by the in-medium effective masses as used in the IBUU transport model calculations. The relaxation time of neutrons is larger while that of protons is smaller in neutron-rich nuclear matter compared with that in symmetric nuclear matter, and this leads to a larger specific viscosity in neutron-rich nuclear matter. In addition, the specific viscosity decreases with increasing temperature because of more frequent collisions and weaker Pauli blocking effect at higher temperatures. At lower temperatures the specific viscosity increases with increasing density due to the Pauli blocking effect, while at higher temperatures it slightly decreases with increasing density as a result of smaller in-medium effective masses at higher densities.",nucl,nucl-th,Directed flow of antiprotons in Au+Au collisions at AGS,Directed flow of antiprotons is studied in Au+Au collisions at a beam momentum of 11.5A GeV/c.

Acoustic-like dynamics of amorphous drugs in the THz regime,"The high frequency dynamics of Indomethacin and Celecoxib glasses has been investigated by inelastic x-ray scattering, accessing a momentum-energy region still unexplored in amorphous pharmaceuticals.

It is shown that spin diffusion in ferromagnets assumes a tensor form. The diagonal terms are renormalized with respect to that in normal metals and enhances the dissipation in the magnetic system while the off-diagonal terms renormalize the precessional frequency of the conduction electrons and enhances the non-adiabatic spin torque. To demonstrate the new physics in our theory, we show that self-consistent solutions of the spin diffusion equations and the Landau-Lifshitz equations in the presence of a current lead to a an increase in the terminal velocity of a domain wall which becomes strongly dependent on its width. We also provide a simplified equation that predicts damping due to the conduction electrons.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,0

This is in contrast to the previous theoretical prediction [2] and experiment observation from Leo et.al. [3] where the Einstein relation increases with 1/T.

Taming Instabilities in Power Grid Networks by Decentralized Control,"Renewables will soon dominate energy production in our electric power system. And yet, how to integrate renewable energy into the grid and the market is still a subject of major debate. Decentral Smart Grid Control (DSGC) was recently proposed as a robust and decentralized approach to balance supply and demand and to guarantee a grid operation that is both economically and dynamically feasible. Here, we analyze the impact of network topology by assessing the stability of essential network motifs using both linear stability analysis and basin volume for delay systems. Our results indicate that if frequency measurements are averaged over sufficiently large time intervals, DSGC enhances the stability of extended power grid systems. We further investigate whether DSGC supports centralized and/or decentralized power production and find it to be applicable to both. However, our results on cycle-like systems suggest that DSGC favors systems with decentralized production. Here, lower line capacities and lower averaging times are required compared to those with centralized production.",nlin,nlin.AO,"Affine Lie group approach to a derivative nonlinear Schr\""odinger equatoin and its similarity reduction","The generalized Drinfel'd-Sokolov hierarchies studied by de Groot-Hollowood-Miramontes are extended from the viewpoint of Sato-Wilson dressing method.

Lattice formulation of chiral gauge theories,"We present a general formulation of chiral gauge theories, which admits Dirac operators with more general spectra, reveals considerably more possibilities for the structure of the chiral projections, and nevertheless allows appropriate realizations. In our analyses we use two forms of the correlation functions which both also apply in the presence of zero modes and for any value of the index. To account properly for the conditions on the bases the concept of equivalence classes of pairs of them is introduced. The behaviors under gauge transformations and under CP transformations are unambiguously derived.",hep,hep-lat,Annihilation Rates of $^3D_2(2^{--})$ and $^3D_3(3^{--})$ Heavy Quarkonia,"We calculate the annihilation decay rates of the $^3D_2(2^{--})$ and $^3D_3(3^{--})$ charmonia and bottomonia by using the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter method. The wave functions of states with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{--}$ and $3^{--}$ are constructed. By solving the corresponding instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equations, we obtain the mass spectra and wave functions of the quarkonia. The annihilation amplitude is written within Mandelstam formalism and the relativistic corrections are taken into account properly. This is important, especially for high excited states, since their relativistic corrections are large. The results for the $3g$ channel are as follows: $\Gamma_{^3D_2(c\bar c)\rightarrow ggg} = 9.24$ keV, $\Gamma_{^3D_3(c\bar c)\rightarrow ggg}=25.0$ keV, $\Gamma_{^3D_2(b\bar b)\rightarrow ggg}= 1.87$ keV, and $\Gamma_{^3D_3(b\bar b)\rightarrow ggg}= 0.815$ keV.",hep,hep-ph,0
Calculation of the Excitations of Dense Quark Matter at Zero Temperature,"Recently there has been a great deal of interest in studying the properties of dense quark matter, with particular reference to diquark condensates and color superconductivity. In the present work we report calculations made for the excitations of quark matter for relatively low densities of the deconfined phase and in the absence of meson or diquark condensation. Here, we are interested in elucidating the role of ""Pauli blocking"", as such blocking affects the calculation vector, scalar and pseudoscalar $q\bar q$ excitations. As a byproduct of our analysis, we extend our calculations to higher densities and explore some consequences of the use of density-dependent coupling parameters for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. (Such density-dependent parameters have been used in some of our previous work.) For our analysis made at large values of the matter density, we assume that at about 13 times nuclear matter density quark matter has only minimal nonperturbative interactions. At that high density we compare the result for hadronic current correlation functions calculated with density-dependent and density-independent NJL coupling constants. We find evidence for the use of density-dependent parameters, since the results with the density-independent constants do not go over to the perturbative description which we assume to be correct for $\rho\simeq 6\rho_c$, where $\rho_c$ is the matter density for the finite-density confinement-deconfinement transition. The use of density-dependent coupling constants in the study of diquark condensates and color superconductivity has not been explored as yet, and is a topic requiring further investigation, particularly given the strong interest in the properties of dense quark matter and color superconductivity.",hep,hep-lat,Genus One Partition Function of the Calabi-Yau d-Fold embedded in ${CP^{d+1}}$,"For a one-parameter family of Calabi-Yau d-fold M embedded in ${{CP}^{d+1}}$, we consider a new quasi-topological field theory ${A^{\ast}}$(M)-model compared with the $A$(M)-model. The two point correlators on the sigma model moduli space (the hermitian metrics) are analyzed by the $A{A^{\ast}}$-fusion on the world sheet sphere. A set of equations of these correlators turns out to be a non-affine A-type Toda equation system for the d-fold M. This non-affine property originates in the vanishing first Chern class of M. Using the results of the $A{A^{\ast}}$-equation, we obtain a genus one partition function of the sigma model associated to the M in the recipe of the holomorphic anomaly. By taking an asymmetrical limit of the complexified {\kae} parameters ${\bar{t}\rightarrow \infty}$ and $t$ is fixed, the ${A^{\ast}}$(M)-model part is decoupled and we can obtain a partition function (or one point function of the operator ${{\cal O}^{(1)}}$ associated to a {\kae} form of M) of the $A$(M)-matter coupled with the topological gravity at the stringy one loop level.

(Anti-)deuteron production and anisotropic flow measured with ALICE at the LHC,"The high abundance of (anti-)deuterons in the statistics gathered in Run 1 of the LHC and the excellent performance of the ALICE setup allow for the simultaneous measurement of the elliptic flow and the deuteron production rates with a large transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) reach. The (anti-) deuterons are identified using the specific energy loss in the time projection chamber and the velocity information in the time-of-flight detector. The elliptic flow of (anti-)deuterons can provide insight into the production mechanisms of particles in heavy-ion collisions. Quark coalescence is one of the approaches to describe the elliptic flow of hadrons, while the production of light nuclei can be also depicted as a coalescence of nucleons. In these proceedings, the measured $v_{2}$ of deuterons produced in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=2.76TeV will be compared to expectations from coalescence and hydrodynamic models.",nucl,nucl-ex,Octupole deformations in actinides at high spins within the cranking Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach,"The cranked Skyrme III effective Hamiltonian is applied for the analysis of the rotational dependence of the quadrupole and octupole moments in Ra, Th, and U isotopes.

We describe the properties of active turbulence as momentum propagation is screened by frictional damping. As friction is increased, the spacing between the walls in the nematic director field decreases as a consequence of the more rapid velocity decays. This leads to, first, a regime with more walls and an increased number of topological defects, and then to a jammed state in which the walls deliminate bands of opposing flow, analogous to the shear bands observed in passive complex fluids.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,0
Comparison of cosmological parameter inference methods applied to supernovae lightcurves fitted with SALT2,"We present a comparison of two methods for cosmological parameter inference from supernovae Ia lightcurves fitted with the SALT2 technique. The standard chi-square methodology and the recently proposed Bayesian hierarchical method (BHM) are each applied to identical sets of simulations based on the 3-year data release from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3), and also data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Low Redshift sample and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), assuming a concordance LCDM cosmology. For both methods, we find that the recovered values of the cosmological parameters, and the global nuisance parameters controlling the stretch and colour corrections to the supernovae lightcurves, suffer from small biasses. The magnitude of the biasses is similar in both cases, with the BHM yielding slightly more accurate results, in particular for cosmological parameters when applied to just the SNLS3 single survey data sets. Most notably, in this case, the biasses in the recovered matter density $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$ are in opposite directions for the two methods. For any given realisation of the SNLS3-type data, this can result in a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy in the estimated value of $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$ between the two methods, which we find to be the case for real SNLS3 data. As more higher and lower redshift SNIa samples are included, however, the cosmological parameter estimates of the two methods converge.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Multi-Messenger Gravitational Wave Searches with Pulsar Timing Arrays: Application to 3C66B Using the NANOGrav 11-year Data Set,"When galaxies merge, the supermassive black holes in their centers may form binaries and, during the process of merger, emit low-frequency gravitational radiation in the process. In this paper we consider the galaxy 3C66B, which was used as the target of the first multi-messenger search for gravitational waves. Due to the observed periodicities present in the photometric and astrometric data of the source of the source, it has been theorized to contain a supermassive black hole binary. Its apparent 1.05-year orbital period would place the gravitational wave emission directly in the pulsar timing band. Since the first pulsar timing array study of 3C66B, revised models of the source have been published, and timing array sensitivities and techniques have improved dramatically. With these advances, we further constrain the chirp mass of the potential supermassive black hole binary in 3C66B to less than $(1.65\pm0.02) \times 10^9~{M_\odot}$ using data from the NANOGrav 11-year data set. This upper limit provides a factor of 1.6 improvement over previous limits, and a factor of 4.3 over the first search done. Nevertheless, the most recent orbital model for the source is still consistent with our limit from pulsar timing array data. In addition, we are able to quantify the improvement made by the inclusion of source properties gleaned from electromagnetic data to `blind' pulsar timing array searches. With these methods, it is apparent that it is not necessary to obtain exact a priori knowledge of the period of a binary to gain meaningful astrophysical inferences.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,0
Predictive data-driven model based on generative adversarial network for premixed turbulence-combustion regimes,"Premixed flames exhibit different asymptotic regimes of interaction between heat release and turbulence depending on their respective length scales. At high Karlovitz number, the dilatation caused by heat release does not have any relevant effect on turbulent kinetic energy with respect to non-reacting flow, while at low Karlovitz number, the mean shear is a sink of turbulent kinetic energy, and counter-gradient transport is observed. This latter phenomenon is not well captured by closure models commonly used in Large Eddy Simulations that are based on gradient diffusion. The massive amount of data available from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) opens the possibility to develop data-driven models able to represent physical mechanisms and non-linear features present in both these regimes. In this work, the databases are formed by DNSs of two planar hydrogen/air flames at different Karlovitz numbers corresponding to the two asymptotic regimes. In this context, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) gives the possibility to successfully recognize and reconstruct both gradient and counter-gradient phenomena if trained with databases where both regimes are included. Two GAN models were first trained each for a specific Karlovitz number and tested using the same dataset in order to verify the capability of the models to learn the features of a single asymptotic regime and assess its accuracy. In both cases, the GAN models were able to reconstruct the Reynolds stress subfilter scales accurately. Later, the GAN was trained with a mixture of both datasets to create a model containing physical knowledge of both combustion regimes. This model was able to reconstruct the subfilter scales for both cases capturing the interaction between heat release and turbulence closely to the DNS as shown from the turbulent kinetic budget and barycentric maps.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,Relativistic magnetic reconnection driven by a laser interacting with a micro-scale plasma slab,"Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process associated with conversion of the embedded magnetic field energy into kinetic and thermal plasma energy, via bulk acceleration and Ohmic dissipation. In many high-energy astrophysical events, magnetic reconnection is invoked to explain the non-thermal signatures. However, the processes by which field energy is transferred to the plasma to power the observed emission are still not properly understood. Here, via 3D particle-in-cell simulations of a readily available (TW-mJ-class) laser interacting with a micro-scale plasma slab, we show that when the electron beams excited on both sides of the slab approach the end of the plasma structure, ultrafast relativistic magnetic reconnection occurs in a magnetically-dominated (low-$\beta$) plasma. The resulting efficient particle acceleration leads to the emission of relativistic electron jets with cut-off energy $\sim$ 12 MeV. The proposed scenario can significantly improve understanding of fundamental questions such as reconnection rate, field dissipation and particle acceleration in relativistic magnetic reconnection.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,0
Complex central structures suggest complex evolutionary paths for barred S0 galaxies,"We investigate three barred lenticular galaxies (NGC 2681, NGC 3945 and NGC 4371) which were previously reported to have complex central structures but without a detailed structural analysis of these galaxies' high-resolution data. We have therefore performed four- to six-component (pseudo-)bulge/disk/bar/ring/point source) decompositions of the composite (Hubble Space Telescope plus ground-based) surface brightness profiles. We find that NGC 2681 hosts three bars, while NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 are double- and single-barred galaxies, respectively, in agreement with past isophotal analysis. We find that the bulges in these galaxies are compact, and have S\'ersic indices of $n\sim 2.2 - 3.6$ and stellar masses of $M_{*}$ $\sim 0.28\times10^{10} - 1.1\times10^{10} M_{\sun}$. NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 have intermediate-scale `pseudo-bulges' that are well described by a S\'ersic model with low $n \la 0.5$ instead of an exponential ($n=1$) profile as done in the past. We measure emission line fluxes enclosed within 9 different elliptical apertures, finding that NGC 2681 has a LINER-type emission inside $R \sim 3\arcsec$, but the emission line due to star formation is significant when aperture size is increased. In contrast, NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 have composite (AGN plus star forming)- and LINER-type emissions inside and outside $R \sim 2\arcsec$, respectively. Our findings suggest that the three galaxies have experienced a complex evolutionary path. The bulges appear to be consequences of an earlier violent merging event while subsequent disk formation via gas accretion and bar-driven perturbations may account for the build-up of pseudo-bulges, bars, rings and point sources.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,The mean free path of hydrogen ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization,"We use the Aurora radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to study the mean free path (MFP) for hydrogen ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization. We directly measure the MFP by averaging the distance 1 Ry photons travel before reaching an optical depth of unity along random lines-of-sight. During reionization the free paths tend to end in neutral gas with densities near the cosmic mean, while after reionizaton the end points tend to be overdense but highly ionized. Despite the increasing importance of discrete, over-dense systems, the cumulative contribution of systems with $N_{\rm{HI}} \lesssim 10^{16.5}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$ suffices to drive the MFP at $z \approx 6$, while at earlier times higher column densities are more important. After reionization the typical size of HI systems is close to the local Jeans length, but during reionization it is much larger. The mean free path for photons originating close to galaxies, $\rm{MFP_{gal}}$, is much smaller than the cosmic MFP. After reionization this enhancement can remain significant up to starting distances of $\sim 1$ comoving Mpc. During reionization, however, $\rm{MFP_{gal}}$ for distances $\sim 10^2 - 10^3$ comoving kpc typically exceeds the cosmic MFP. These findings have important consequences for models that interpret the intergalactic MFP as the distance escaped ionizing photons can travel from galaxies before being absorbed and may cause them to under-estimate the required escape fraction from galaxies, and/or the required emissivity of ionizing photons after reionization.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,0
"Attractive Inverse Square Potential, U(1) Gauge, and Winding Transitions","The inverse square potential arises in a variety of different quantum phenomena, yet notoriously it must be handled with care: it suffers from pathologies rooted in the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. We show that its recently studied conformality-breaking corresponds to an infinitely smooth winding-unwinding topological transition for the {\it classical} statistical mechanics of a one-dimensional system: this describes the the tangling/untangling of floppy polymers under a biasing torque. When the ratio between torque and temperature exceeds a critical value the polymer undergoes tangled oscillations, with an extensive winding number. At lower torque or higher temperature the winding number per unit length is zero. Approaching criticality, the correlation length of the order parameter---the extensive winding number---follows a Kosterlitz-Thouless type law. The model is described by the Wilson line of a (0+1) $U(1)$ gauge theory, and applies to the tangling/untangling of floppy polymers and to the winding/diffusing kinetics in diffusion-convection-reactions.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Superconductivity without inversion and time-reversal symmetries,"The traditional symmetries that protect superconductivity are time-reversal and inversion.

We classify superconducting states stabilized by these two symmetries, when time-reversal and inversion symmetries are not present, and provide realistic minimal models as examples. Interestingly, several experimentally realized systems, such as transition metal dichalcogenides and the two-dimensional Rashba system belong to this category, when subject to an applied magnetic field.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,0
Mapping the ionised gas around the luminous QSO HE 1029-1401: Evidence for minor merger events?,"We present VIMOS integral field spectroscopy of the brightest radio-quiet QSO on the southern sky HE 1029-1401 at a redshift of z=0.086. Standard decomposition techniques for broad-band imaging are extended to integral field data in order to deblend the QSO and host emission. We perform a tentative analysis of the stellar continuum finding a young stellar population (<100Myr) or a featureless continuum embedded in an old stellar population (10Gyr) typical for a massive elliptical galaxy. The stellar velocity dispersion of sigma_*=320\pm90 km/s and the estimated black hole mass log(M_BH/M_sun)=8.7\pm0.3 are consistent with the local M_BH-sigma_* relation within the errors. For the first time we map the two-dimensional ionised gas distribution and the gas velocity field around HE 1029-1401. While the stellar host morphology is purely elliptical we find a highly structured distribution of ionised gas out to 16 kpc from the QSO. The gas is highly ionised solely by the QSO radiation and has a significantly lower metallicity than would be expected for the stellar mass of the host, indicating an external origin of the gas most likely due to minor mergers. We find a rotating gas disc around the QSO and a dispersion-dominated non-rotating gas component within the central 3 kpc. At larger distances the velocity field is heavily disturbed, which could be interpreted as another signature of past minor merger events. Alternatively, the arc-like structure seen in the ionised gas might also be indicative of a large-scale expanding bubble, centred on and possibly driven by the active nucleus.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,A VLT/FLAMES survey for massive binaries in Westerlund 1: II. Dynamical constraints on magnetar progenitor masses from the eclipsing binary W13,"Westerlund 1 is a young, massive Galactic starburst cluster that contains a rich coeval population of Wolf-Rayet stars, hot- and cool-phase transitional supergiants, and a magnetar. We use spectroscopic and photometric observations of the eclipsing double-lined binary W13 to derive dynamical masses for the two components, in order to determine limits for the progenitor masses of the magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 and the population of evolved stars in Wd1. W13 has an orbital period of 9.2709+/-0.0015 days and near-contact configuration. The shallow photometric eclipse rules out an inclination greater than 65 degrees, leading to lower limits for the masses of the emission-line optical primary and supergiant optical secondary of 21.4+/-2.6Msun and 32.8+/-4.0Msun respectively, rising to 23.2 +3.3/-3.0Msun and 35.4 +5.0/-4.6 Msun for our best-fit inclination 62 +3/-4 degrees. Comparison with theoretical models of Wolf-Rayet binary evolution suggest the emission-line object had an initial mass in excess of 35Msun, with the most likely model featuring highly non-conservative late-Case-A/Case-B mass transfer and an initial mass in excess of 40Msun. This confirms the high magnetar progenitor mass inferred from its membership in Wd1, and represents the first dynamical constraint on the progenitor mass of any magnetar. The red supergiants in Wd1 must have similar progenitor masses to W13 and are therefore amongst the most massive stars to undergo a red supergiant phase, representing a challenge for population models that suggest stars in this mass range end their redwards evolution as yellow hypergiants.

A study of cascading failures in real and synthetic power grid topologies using DC power flows,"Using the linearized DC power flow model, we study cascading failures and their spatial and temporal properties in the US Western Interconnect (USWI) power grid. We also introduce the preferential Degree And Distance Attachment (DADA) model, with similar degree distributions, resistances, and currents to the USWI. We investigate the behavior of both grids resulting from the failure of a single line. We find that the DADA model and the USWI model react very similarly to that failure, and that their blackout characteristics resemble each other. In many cases, the failure of a single line can cause cascading failures, which impact the entire grid. We characterize the resilience of the grid by three parameters, the most important of which is tolerance ${\alpha}$, which is the ratio of the maximal load a line can carry to its initial load. We characterize a blackout by its yield, which we define as the ratio of the final to the initial consumed currents. We find that if ${\alpha}\leq2$, the probability of a large blackout occurring is very small. By contrast, in a broad range of $1 < {\alpha} < 2$, the initial failure of a single line can result, with a high probability, in cascading failures leading to a massive blackout with final yield less than 80%. The yield has a bimodal distribution typical of a first-order transition, i.e., the failure of a randomly selected line leads either to an insignificant current reduction or to a major blackout. We find that there is a latent period in the development of major blackouts during which few lines are overloaded, and the yield remains high. The duration of this latent period is proportional to the tolerance. The existence of the latent period suggests that intervention during early time steps of a cascade can significantly reduce the risk of a major blackout.",physics,physics.soc-ph,Experience with the AHCAL Calibration System in the Test Beam,We present herein our experience with the calibration system in the CALICE AHCAL prototype in the test beam and discuss characterizations of the SiPM response curves.,physics,physics.ins-det,0
Globular cluster systems in nearby dwarf galaxies - II. Nuclear star clusters and their relation to massive Galactic globular clusters,"(Abridged) Using luminosities and structural parameters of globular clusters (GCs) in the nuclear regions (nGCs) of low-mass dwarf galaxies from HST/ACS imaging we derive the present-day escape velocities (v_esc) of stellar ejecta to reach the cluster tidal radius and compare them with those of Galactic GCs with extended (hot) horizontal branches (EHBs-GCs). For EHB-GCs, we find a correlation between the present-day v_esc and their metallicity as well as (V-I)_0 colour. The similar v_esc, (V-I)_0 distribution of nGCs and EHB-GCs implies that nGCs could also have complex stellar populations. The v_esc-[Fe/H] relation could reflect the known relation of increasing stellar wind velocity with metallicity, which in turn could explain why more metal-poor clusters typically show more peculiarities in their stellar population than more metal-rich clusters of the same mass do. Thus the cluster v_esc can be used as parameter to describe the degree of self-enrichment. The nGCs populate the same Mv vs. rh region as EHB-GCs, although they do not reach the sizes of the largest EHB-GCs like wCen and NGC 2419. We argue that during accretion the rh of an nGC could increase due to significant mass loss in the cluster vicinity and the resulting drop in the external potential in the core once the dwarf galaxy dissolves. Our results support the scenario in which Galactic EHB-GCs have originated in the centres of pre-Galactic building blocks or dwarf galaxies that were later accreted by the Milky Way.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,COMAP Early Science: I. Overview,"The CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) aims to use line intensity mapping of carbon monoxide (CO) to trace the distribution and global properties of galaxies over cosmic time, back to the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To validate the technologies and techniques needed for this goal, a Pathfinder instrument has been constructed and fielded. Sensitive to CO(1-0) emission from $z=2.4$-$3.4$ and a fainter contribution from CO(2-1) at $z=6$-8, the Pathfinder is surveying $12$ deg$^2$ in a 5-year observing campaign to detect the CO signal from $z\sim3$. Using data from the first 13 months of observing, we estimate $P_\mathrm{CO}(k) = -2.7 \pm 1.7 \times 10^4\mu\mathrm{K}^2 \mathrm{Mpc}^3$ on scales $k=0.051-0.62 \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ - the first direct 3D constraint on the clustering component of the CO(1-0) power spectrum. Based on these observations alone, we obtain a constraint on the amplitude of the clustering component (the squared mean CO line temperature-bias product) of $\langle Tb\rangle^2<49$ $\mu$K$^2$ - nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement on the previous best measurement. These constraints allow us to rule out two models from the literature. We forecast a detection of the power spectrum after 5 years with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) 9-17. Cross-correlation with an overlapping galaxy survey will yield a detection of the CO-galaxy power spectrum with S/N of 19. We are also conducting a 30 GHz survey of the Galactic plane and present a preliminary map. Looking to the future of COMAP, we examine the prospects for future phases of the experiment to detect and characterize the CO signal from the EoR.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,0
Painleve equations in terms of entire functions,"In these lectures we discuss how the Painleve equations can be written in terms of entire functions, and then in the Hirota bilinear (or multilinear) form. Hirota's method, which has been so useful in soliton theory, is reviewed and connections from soliton equations to Painleve equations through similarity reductions are discussed from this point of view. In the main part we discuss how singularity structure of the solutions and formal integration of the Painleve equations can be used to find a representation in terms of entire functions. Sometimes the final result is a pair of Hirota bilinear equations, but for $P_{VI}$ we need also a quadrilinear expression. The use of discrete versions of Painleve equations is also discussed briefly. It turns out that with discrete equations one gets better information on the singularities, which can then be represented in terms of functions with a simple zero.",nlin,nlin.SI,"Shear dispersion along circular pipes is affected by bends, but the torsion of the pipe is negligible","The flow of a viscous fluid along a curving pipe of fixed radius is driven by a pressure gradient. For a generally curving pipe it is the fluid flux which is constant along the pipe and so I correct fluid flow solutions of Dean (1928) and Topakoglu (1967) which assume constant pressure gradient. When the pipe is straight, the fluid adopts the parabolic velocity profile of Poiseuille flow; the spread of any contaminant along the pipe is then described by the shear dispersion model of Taylor (1954) and its refinements by Mercer, Watt et al (1994,1996). However, two conflicting effects occur in a generally curving pipe: viscosity skews the velocity profile which enhances the shear dispersion; whereas in faster flow centrifugal effects establish secondary flows that reduce the shear dispersion. The two opposing effects cancel at a Reynolds number of about 15. Interestingly, the torsion of the pipe seems to have very little effect upon the flow or the dispersion, the curvature is by far the dominant influence. Lastly, curvature and torsion in the fluid flow significantly enhance the upstream tails of concentration profiles in qualitative agreement with observations of dispersion in river flow.",nlin,nlin.PS,0
Self-interacting dark matter with a stable vector mediator,"Light vector mediators can naturally induce velocity-dependent dark matter self-interactions while at the same time allowing for the correct dark matter relic abundance via thermal freeze-out. If these mediators subsequently decay into Standard Model states such as electrons or photons however, this is robustly excluded by constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We study to what extent this conclusion can be circumvented if the vector mediator is stable and hence contributes to the dark matter density while annihilating into lighter degrees of freedom. We find viable parts of parameter space which lead to the desired self-interaction cross section of dark matter to address the small-scale problems of the collisionless cold dark matter paradigm while being compatible with bounds from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis observations.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Evidence for large-scale excesses associated with low HI column densities in the sky $$\\$$I. Dust excess,"Where dust and gas are uniformly mixed, atomic hydrogen can be traced through the detection of far-infrared (FIR) or UV emission of dust. We considered, for the origin of discrepancies observed between various direct and indirect tracers of gas outside the Galactic plane, possible corrections to the zero levels of the Planck-HFI detectors. We set the zero levels of the Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) skymaps as well as the 100 $\mu$m map from COBE/DIRBE and IRAS from the correlation between FIR emission and atomic hydrogen column density excluding regions of lowest gas column density. A modified blackbody model fit to those new zero-subtracted maps led to significantly different maps of the opacity spectral index $\beta$ and temperature $T$ and an overall increase in the optical depth at 353 GHz $\tau_{353}$ of 7.1$\times$10$^{-7}$ compared to the data release 2 Planck map. When comparing $\tau_{353}$ and the HI column density, we observed a uniform spatial distribution of the opacity outside regions with dark neutral gas and CO except in various large-scale regions of low NHI that represent 25% of the sky. In those regions, we observed an average dust column density 45% higher than predictions based on NHI with a maximum of 250% toward the Lockman Hole region. From the average opacity $\sigma_{e 353}$=(8.9$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{-27}$ cm$^2$ we deduced a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.53$\times$10$^{-2}$. We did not see evidence of dust associated to a Reynolds layer of ionized hydrogen. We measured a far-ultraviolet isotropic intensity of 137$\pm$15 photons s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$$A$$^{-1}$ in agreement with extragalactic flux predictions and a near-ultraviolet isotropic intensity of 378$\pm$45 photons s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$$A$$^{-1}$ corresponding to twice the predicted flux.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
Conversion electrons used to monitor the energy scale of electron spectrometer near tritium endpoint - a simulation study,"Measurements of the endpoint region of the tritium beta-decay spectrum provides good possibility to determine neutrino mass. This, however, needs a perfect monitoring of the spectrometer energy scale. A parallel measurement of electron line of known energy - in particular the 83mKr conversion K-line - may serve well to this purpose. The 83Rb decaying to 83mKr seems to be a very suitable radioactive source due to its halflife of 86.2 day. In this work, we determine the amount of 83Rb which is necessary for a successful monitoring.",nucl,nucl-ex,Predictions of covariant chiral perturbation theory for nucleon polarisabilities and polarised Compton scattering,"We update the predictions of the SU(2) baryon chiral perturbation theory for the dipole polarisabilities of the proton, $\{\alpha_{E1},\,\beta_{M1}\}_p=\{11.2(0.7),\,3.9(0.7)\}\times10^{-4}$fm$^3$, and obtain the corresponding predictions for the quadrupole, dispersive, and spin polarisabilities: $\{\alpha_{E2},\,\beta_{M2}\}_p=\{17.3(3.9),\,-15.5(3.5)\}\times10^{-4}$fm$^5$, $\{\alpha_{E1\nu},\,\beta_{M1\nu}\}_p=\{-1.3(1.0),\,7.1(2.5)\}\times10^{-4}$fm$^5$, and $\{\gamma_{E1E1},\,\gamma_{M1M1},\,\gamma_{E1M2},\,\gamma_{M1E2}\}_p=\{-3.3(0.8),\,2.9(1.5),\,0.2(0.2),\,1.1(0.3)\}\times10^{-4}$fm$^4$. The results for the scalar polarisabilities are in significant disagreement with semi-empirical analyses based on dispersion relations, however the results for the spin polarisabilities agree remarkably well. Results for proton Compton-scattering multipoles and polarised observables up to the Delta(1232) resonance region are presented too. The asymmetries $\Sigma_3$ and $\Sigma_{2x}$ reproduce the experimental data from LEGS and MAMI. Results for $\Sigma_{2z}$ agree with a recent sum rule evaluation in the forward kinematics. The asymmetry $\Sigma_{1z}$ near the pion production threshold shows a large sensitivity to chiral dynamics, but no data is available for this observable. We also provide the predictions for the polarisabilities of the neutron: $\{\alpha_{E1},\,\beta_{M1}\}_n=\{13.7(3.1),\,4.6(2.7)\}\times10^{-4}$fm$^3$, $\{\alpha_{E2},\,\beta_{M2}\}_n=\{16.2(3.7),\,-15.8(3.6)\}\times10^{-4}$fm$^5$, $\{\alpha_{E1\nu},\,\beta_{M1\nu}\}_n=\{0.1(1.0),\,7.2(2.5)\}\times10^{-4}$fm$^5$, and $\{\gamma_{E1E1},\,\gamma_{M1M1},\,\gamma_{E1M2},\,\gamma_{M1E2}\}_n=\{-4.7(1.1),\,2.9(1.5),\,0.2(0.2),\,1.6(0.4)\}\times10^{-4}$fm$^4$.

"Spectroscopic factors, overlaps, and isospin symmetry from an $R$-matrix point of view","Background: Spectroscopic factors, overlaps, and isospin symmetry are often used in conjunction with single-particle wave functions for the phenomenological analysis of nuclear structure and reactions. Many differing prescriptions for connecting these quantities to physically relevant asymptotic normalization constants or widths are available in the literature, but their relationship and degree of validity are not always clear. Purpose: This paper derives relationships among the above quantities of interest using well-defined methodology and starting assumptions. Method: $R$-matrix theory is used as the primary tool to interoperate between the quantities of interest to this work. Particular attention is paid to effects arising from beyond the nuclear surface, where isospin symmetry is strongly violated. Results: Relationships among the quantities of interest are derived. Example applications of these methods to mirror levels in nucleon+${}^{12}{\rm C}$, nucleon+${}^{16}{\rm O}$, and nucleon+${}^{26}{\rm Al}$ are presented. A new approach to multi-level mirror symmetry is derived and applied to the first three $2^+$ states of ${}^{18}{\rm O}$ and ${}^{18}{\rm Ne}$. Conclusions: The relationship between the quantities of interest is clarified and certain procedures are recommended. It is found that the asymptotic normalization constant of the second $2^+$ state in ${}^{18}{\rm Ne}$ deduced from the mirror state in ${}^{18}{\rm O}$ is significantly larger than found in previous work. This finding has the effect of increasing the ${}^{17}{\rm F}(p,\gamma){}^{18}{\rm Ne}$ reaction rate in novae.",nucl,nucl-th,Nuclear parton distribution functions and their effects on sin^2 theta_W anomaly,Nuclear parton distribution functions (NPDFs) are investigated by analyzing the data on structure functions F_2^A and Drell-Yan cross sections sigma_{DY}^{pA}. An important point of this analysis is to show uncertainties of the NPDFs by the Hessian method. The analysis indicates that the uncertainties are large for antiquark distributions at x>0.2 and gluon distributions in the whole x region. We also discuss a nuclear effect on the NuTeV sin^2 theta_W anomaly as an application.,nucl,nucl-ex,0
"Star clusters in M33: updated UBVRI photometry, ages, metallicities, and masses","The photometric characterization of M33 star clusters is far from complete. In this paper, we present homogeneous $UBVRI$ photometry of 708 star clusters and cluster candidates in M33 based on archival images from the Local Group Galaxies Survey, which covers 0.8 deg$^2$ along the galaxy's major axis. Our photometry includes 387, 563, 616, 580, and 478 objects in the $UBVRI$ bands, respectively, of which 276, 405, 430, 457, and 363 do not have previously published $UBVRI$ photometry. Our photometry is consistent with previous measurements (where available) in all filters. We adopted Sloan Digital Sky Survey $ugriz$ photometry for complementary purposes, as well as Two Micron All-Sky Survey near-infrared $JHK$ photometry where available. We fitted the spectral-energy distributions of 671 star clusters and candidates to derive their ages, metallicities, and masses based on the updated {\sc parsec} simple stellar populations synthesis models. The results of our $\chi^2$ minimization routines show that only 205 of the 671 clusters ($31\%$) are older than 2 Gyr, which represents a much smaller fraction of the cluster population than that in M31 ($56\%$), suggesting that M33 is dominated by young star clusters ($<1$ Gyr). We investigate the mass distributions of the star clusters---both open and globular clusters---in M33, M31, the Milky Way, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Their mean values are $\log(M_{\rm cl}/M_{\odot})=4.25$, 5.43, 2.72, and 4.18, respectively. The fraction of open to globular clusters is highest in the Milky Way and lowest in M31. Our comparisons of the cluster ages, masses, and metallicities show that our results are basically in agreement with previous studies (where objects in common are available); differences can be traced back to differences in the models adopted, the fitting methods used, and stochastic sampling effects.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,X-ray Substructure Studies of Four Galaxy Clusters using XMM-Newton Data,"Mahdavi et al. find that the degree of agreement between weak lensing and X-ray mass measurements is a function of cluster radius. Numerical simulations also point out that X-ray mass proxies do not work equally well at all radii. The origin of the effect is thought to be associated with cluster mergers. Recent work presenting the cluster maps showed an ability of X-ray maps to reveal and study cluster mergers in detail. Here we present a first attempt to use the study of substructure in assessing the systematics of the hydrostatic mass measurements using two-dimensional (2-D) X-ray diagnostics. The temperature map is uniquely able to identify the substructure in an almost relaxed cluster which would be unnoticed in the ICM electron number density and pressure maps. We describe the radial fluctuations in the 2-D maps by a cumulative/differential scatter profile relative to the mean profile within/at a given radius. The amplitude indicates ~10 fluctuations in the temperature, electron number density and entropy maps, and ~15 fluctuations in the pressure map. The amplitude of and the discontinuity in the scatter complement 2-D substructure diagnostics, e.g. indicating the most disturbed radial range. There is a tantalizing link between the substructure identified using the scatter of the entropy and pressure fluctuations and the hydrostatic mass bias relative to the expected mass based on the M-Yx and M-Mgas relations particularly at r500. XMM-Newton observations with ~120,000 source photons from the cluster are sufficient to apply our substructure diagnostics via the spectrally measured 2-D temperature, electron number density, entropy and pressure maps.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,0
Erbium-doped aluminophosphosilicate all-fiber laser operating at 1584 nm,"We report on an ytterbium-free erbium-doped aluminophosphosilicate all-fiber laser, producing an output power of 25 W at a wavelength of 1584 nm with a slope efficiency of 30% with respect to the 976 nm absorbed pump power. The simple cavity design proposed takes advantage of fiber Bragg gratings written directly in the gain fiber. The single-mode erbium-doped aluminophosphosilicate fiber was fabricated in-house and was doped with 0.06 mol.% of Er2O3, 1.77 mol.% of Al2O3 and 1.04 mol.% of P2O5. The incorporation of aluminium and phosphorus into the fiber core allowed for an increased concentration of erbium without inducing significant clustering, while keeping the numerical aperture low to ensure a single-mode laser operation.",physics,physics.optics,Generation of reference dc currents at 1 nA level with the capacitance-charging method,"The capacitance-charging method is a well-established and handy technique for the generation of dc current in the 100 pA range or lower.

We propose here a range extender amplifier, which can be employed as a plug-in component in existing calibration setups, and allows the generation of currents in the 1 nA range. The extender has been employed in the INRIM setup and validated with two comparisons at 100 pA and 1 nA current level.

Integrated K-band spectra of old and intermediate-age globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud,"Current stellar population models have arguably the largest uncertainties in the near-IR wavelength range, partly due to a lack of large and well calibrated empirical spectral libraries. In this paper we present a project, which aim it is to provide the first library of luminosity weighted integrated near-IR spectra of globular clusters to be used to test the current stellar population models and serve as calibrators for the future ones. Our pilot study presents spatially integrated K-band spectra of three old (>10 Gyr) and metal poor ([Fe/H]~-1.4), and three intermediate age (1-2 Gyr) and more metal rich ([Fe/H]~-0.4) globular clusters in the LMC. We measured the line strengths of the Na I, Ca I and 12CO(2-0) absorption features. The Na I index decreases with the increasing age and decreasing metallicity of the clusters. The Dco index, used to measure the 12CO(2-0) line strength, is significantly reduced by the presence of carbon-rich TP-AGB stars in the globular clusters with age ~1 Gyr. This is in contradiction with the predictions of the stellar population models of Maraston (2005). We find that this disagreement is due to the different CO absorption strength of carbon-rich Milky Way TP-AGB stars used in the models and the LMC carbon stars in our sample. For globular clusters with age >2 Gyr we find Dco index measurements consistent with the model predictions.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Testing the No-Hair Theorem with Observations in the Electromagnetic Spectrum. IV. Relativistically Broadened Iron Lines,"According to the no-hair theorem, astrophysical black holes are fully characterized by their masses and spins and are described by the Kerr metric. This theorem can be tested observationally by measuring (at least) three different multipole moments of the spacetimes of black holes. In this paper, we calculate the profiles of fluorescent iron lines emitted from the accretion flows around black hole candidates within a framework that allows us to perform the calculation as a function of its mass and spin as well as of a free parameter that measures potential deviations from the Kerr metric. We show that such deviations lead to line profiles that are significantly altered and may exhibit a modified flux ratio of the two peaks in their characteristic double-peaked shape. We also show that the disk inclination can be measured independently of the spin and the deviation parameter at low to intermediate inclination angles as in the case of Kerr black holes. We estimate the precision that near-future X-ray missions such as Astro-H and ATHENA+ are required to achieve in order to resolve deviations from the Kerr metric in iron line profiles and show that constraints on such deviations will be strongest for rapidly spinning black holes. More generally, we show that measuring the line profile with a precision of ~5% at disk inclinations of 30 or 60 degrees constraints the deviation parameter to order unity for values of the spin a>0.5M.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,0
Directional coupling of optical signals by odd dark beams with mixed phase dislocations,"Numerical simulations on the evolution of step-screw and edge-screw optical phase dislocations in bulk saturable self-defocusing nonlinear media are presented, with emphasis on their ability to induce steering waveguides for signal beams (pulses).

These manifolds can be easily computed by leveraging the autonomous nature of the vector fields on either side of the time-dependent transition. As illustrative examples we consider a two-dimensional fluid flow in a rotating double-gyre configuration and a simple one-and-a-half degree of freedom model of a resonant particle accelerator.

HERMES: a Monte Carlo Code for the Propagation of Ultra-High Energy Nuclei,"Although the recent experimental efforts to improve the observation of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) above $10^{18}$ eV, the origin and the composition of such particles is still unknown. In this work, we present the novel Monte Carlo code (HERMES) simulating the propagation of UHE nuclei, in the energy range between $10^{16}$ and $10^{22}$ eV, accounting for propagation in the intervening extragalactic and Galactic magnetic fields and nuclear interactions with relic photons of the extragalactic background radiation. In order to show the potential applications of HERMES for astroparticle studies, we estimate the expected flux of UHE nuclei in different astrophysical scenarios, the GZK horizons and we show the expected arrival direction distributions in the presence of turbulent extragalactic magnetic fields.

In this dense star cluster, direct collisions can occur between stars before they evolve off the main-sequence. Using a statistical approach, we characterize the outcomes of these stellar collisions within the inner parsec of the Galactic Center (GC). Close to the SMBH, where the velocity dispersion is larger than the escape speed from a Sun-like star, collisions lead to mass loss. We find that the stellar population within $0.01$ pc is halved within about a Gyr because of destructive collisions. Additionally, we predict a diffuse population of peculiar low-mass stars in the GC. These stars have been divested of their outer layers in the inner $0.01$ pc before migrating to larger distances from the SMBH. Between $0.01$ and $0.1$ pc from the SMBH, collisions can result in mergers. Our results suggest that repeated collisions between lower mass stars can produce massive ($\gtrsim 10$ M$_\odot$) stars, and there may be $\sim 100$ of them residing in this region. We provide predictions on the number of G objects, dust and gas enshrouded stellar objects, that may result from main-sequence stellar collisions. Lastly, we comment on uncertainties in our model and possible connections between stellar collisions and the missing red giants in the GC.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
A New Probabilistic Wave Breaking Model for Dominant Wind-sea Waves Based on the Gaussian Field Theory,"This paper presents a novel method for obtaining the probability wave of breaking ($P_b$) of deep water, dominant wind-sea waves (that is, waves made of the energy within $\pm$30\% of the peak wave frequency) derived from Gaussian wave field theory. For a given input wave spectrum we demonstrate how it is possible to derive a joint probability density function between wave phase speed ($c$) and horizontal orbital velocity at wave crest ($u$) from which a model for $P_b$ can be obtained. A non-linear kinematic wave breaking criterion consistent with the Gaussian framework is further proposed. Our model would allow, therefore, for application of the classical wave breaking criterion (that is, wave breaking occurs if $u/c > 1$) in spectral wave models which, to the authors' knowledge, has not been done to date. Our results show that the proposed theoretical model has errors in the same order of magnitude as six other historical models when assessed using three field datasets. With optimization of the proposed model's single free parameter, it can become the best performing model for specific datasets. Although our results are promising, additional, more complete wave breaking datasets collected in the field are needed to comprehensively assess the present model, especially in regards to the dependence on phenomena such as direct wind forcing, long wave modulation and wave directionality.",physics,physics.ao-ph,Measuring the Effectiveness of Learning Resources Via Student Interaction with Online Learning Modules,"We present a new method for measuring the effectiveness of online learning resources, through the analysis of time-stamped log data of students' interaction with a sequence of online learning modules created based on the concept of mastery learning.

Radiation hardness study of BC408 plastic scintillator under 80 MeV proton beam irradiations,"To investigate the 1.6 GeV high-energy proton beam detector utilized in the CSNS Phase-II upgrade project, a plastic scintillator detector presents a viable option due to its superior radiation hardness. This study investigates the effects of irradiation damage on a BC408 plastic scintillator induced by 80 MeV protons, including absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and light yield tests of BC408 pre- and post-proton irradiation, with a focus on determining the radiation resistance threshold of BC408. The results indicate that the performance of BC408 remains unimpaired at absorbed doses up to 5.14*10^3 Gy/cm3, demonstrating its ability to absorb 1.63*10^13 p/cm3 1.6 GeV protons while maintaining stability.

The analysis of the numerical results shows that exact pairing decreases the two-neutron separation energy in light nuclei, but increases it in heavy nuclei as compared to that obtained within the BCS theory. In neutron-rich medium and heavy nuclei, exact pairing significantly enhances the strength located at the low-energy tail of the GDR, which is usually associated with the pygmy dipole resonance. The line shape of the GDR changes significantly with increasing the neutron number within an isotopic chain if the model parameter is kept fixed at the value determined for the stable isotope.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Synchronization of frustrated phase oscillators in the small-world networks,"We numerically study the synchronization of an identical population of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi phase oscillators in Watts-Strogatz networks.

Anisotropic q-Gaussian velocity distributions in LambdaCDM halos,"The velocity distribution function (VDF) of dark matter (DM) halos in $\Lambda$CDM dissipationless cosmological simulations, which must be non-separable in its radial and tangential components, is still poorly known. We present the first single-parameter, non-separable, anisotropic model for the VDF in $\Lambda$CDM halos, built from an isotropic $q$-Gaussian (Tsallis) VDF of the isotropic set of dimensionless spherical velocity components (after subtraction of streaming motions), normalized by the respective velocity dispersions. We test our VDF on 90 cluster-mass halos of a dissipationless cosmological simulation. Beyond the virial radius, $r_{\rm vir}$, our model VDF adequately reproduces that measured in the simulated halos, but no $q$-Gaussian model can adequately represent the VDF within $r_{\rm vir}$, as the speed distribution function is then flatter-topped than any $q$-Gaussian can allow. Nevertheless, our VDF fits significantly better the simulations than the commonly used Maxwellian (Gaussian) distribution, at virtually all radii within $5\,r_{\rm vir}$. Within 0.4 (1) $r_{\rm vir}$, the non-Gaussianity index $q$ is (roughly) linearly related to the slope of the density profile and also to the velocity anisotropy profile. We provide a parametrization of the modulation of $q$ with radius for both the median fits and the fit of the stacked halo. At radii of a few percent of $r_{\rm vir}$, corresponding to the Solar position in the Milky Way, our best-fit VDF, although fitting better the simulations than the Gaussian one, overproduces significantly the fraction of high velocity objects, indicating that one should not blindly use these $q$-Gaussian fits to make predictions on the direct detection rate of DM particles.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Observing the Evolution of the Universe,"How did the universe evolve?

One may in addition track the evolution of the dark energy and discover the net neutrino mass.

Correlated non-perturbative electron dynamics with quantum trajectories,An approach to electron correlation effects in atoms that uses quantum trajectories is presented. A comparison with the exact quantum mechanical results for 1D Helium atom shows that the major features of the correlated ground state distribution and of the strong field ionization dynamics are reproduced with quantum trajectories. The intra-atomic resonant transitions are described accurately by a trajectory ensemble. The present approach reduces significantly the computational time and it can be used for both bound and ionizing electrons.,physics,physics.atom-ph,Propagation of compressional elastic waves through a 1-D medium with contact nonlinearities,"Propagation of monochromatic elastic waves across cracks is investigated in 1D, both theoretically and numerically.

Multidimensional integrable boundary problems,"A method of looking for boundary conditions consistent with the integrability property of multidimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) type equations is discussed. The method is based on involutions of the Lax pair taken at the border plane. New classes of boundary conditions for the KP and Hirota equations are proposed consistent with the Lax pair. The boundary problem on the stripe 0<y<1 for the KP equation is discussed, its exact solutions are found. Ward's problem on discrete versions of the generalized Toda chains is briefly discussed.",nlin,nlin.SI,Wake-induced response of vibro-impacting systems,"This study investigates the bifurcation behaviour of wake-induced vibro-impacting systems considering fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The primary structure and the near wake dynamics are modelled as a harmonic oscillator a Van der Pol oscillator, respectively, and are weakly coupled to each other. A non-deformable barrier obstructing the motion of the oscillator gives rise to the impacting dynamics. Instantaneous velocity reversal occurs when the structure impacts with this barrier. Qualitative changes in the dynamical behaviour of this system are investigated in the context of discontinuity-induced bifurcations (DIBs) resulting from the interaction of fluid flow and non-smoothness from the primary structure. Phenomenological behaviour like co-existence of attractors and period-adding cascades of limit cycles leading to chaos are examined. Existence of these phenomena are demonstrated via stability analysis using Floquet theory and associated Lyapunov spectra. A new approach to capture the impact dynamics of the hybrid system through a transverse discontinuity map is proposed. Orbits obtained using this new algorithm is demonstrated to accurately predict both stable and chaotic regimes as observed from the corresponding bifurcation diagrams. The effect of the presence of non-smoothness on the lock-in phenomenon in systems that involve fluid-structure interaction is studied for the first time",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Inferring the Solar Meridional Circulation Flow Profile by Applying Bayesian Methods to Time-distance Helioseismology,"Mapping the large-scale subsurface plasma flow profile within the Sun has been attempted using various methods for several decades. One such flow in particular is the meridional circulation, for which numerous studies have been published. However, such studies often show disagreement in structure. In an effort to constrain the flow profile from the data, a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo framework has been developed to take advantage of the advances in computing power that allow for the efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces. This study utilizes helioseismic travel-time difference data covering a span of twenty-one years and a parametrized model of the meridional circulation to find the most likely flow profiles. Tests were carried out on artificial data to determine the ability of this method to recover expected solar-like flow profiles as well as a few extreme cases. We find the method capable of recovering the input flows of both single- and double-cell flow structures. Some inversion results indicate potential differences in meridional circulation between the two solar cycles in terms of both magnitude and morphology, in particular in the mid convection zone. Of these, the most likely solutions show that solar cycle 23 has a large, single-celled profile, while cycle 24 shows weaker flows in general and hints towards a double-celled structure.",physics,physics.space-ph,Model of horizontal stress in the Aigion10 well (Corinth) calculated from acoustic body waves,"In this paper we try to deduce the in situ stresses from the monopole acoustic waves of the well AIG10 between 689 and 1004 meters in depth (Corinth Golf). This borehole crosses competent sedimentary formations (mainly limestone), and the active Aigion fault between 769 and 780 meters in depth. This study is the application of two methods previously described by the author who shows the relationships between in situ horizontal stresses, and (i) the presence or absence of double body waves, (ii) the amplitude ratios between S and P waves (Rousseau, 2005a,b). The full waveforms of this well exhibit two distinct domains separated by the Aigion fault. Within the upper area the three typical waves (P, S and Stoneley) may appear, but the S waves are not numerous, and there is no double body wave, whereas within the lower area there are sometimes double P waves, but no S waves. From those observations, we conclude that the stress domain is isotropic above the Aigion fault, and anisotropic below, which is consistent with conclusions drawn by authors from other kinds of data. The calculation applied to the characteristics of the double P waves suggests that this horizontal stress anisotropy is very high, up to 190 % with the maximum horizontal stress superior to 100 MPa and the minimum horizontal stress close to zero at 939 meters in depth. The amplitude ratios between the S and P wave indicate a very strong compression - which is isotropic - above the Aigion fault.",physics,physics.geo-ph,0
A scale space based algorithm for automated segmentation of single shot tagged MRI of shearing deformation,"Object This study proposes a scale space based algorithm for automated segmentation of single-shot tagged images of modest SNR. Furthermore the algorithm was designed for analysis of discontinuous or shearing types of motion, i.e. segmentation of broken tag patterns. Materials and methods The proposed algorithm utilizes non-linear scale space for automatic segmentation of single-shot tagged images. The algorithm's ability to automatically segment tagged shearing motion was evaluated in a numerical simulation and in vivo. A typical shearing deformation was simulated in a Shepp-Logan phantom allowing for quantitative evaluation of the algorithm's success rate as a function of both SNR and the amount of deformation. For a qualitative in vivo evaluation tagged images showing deformations in the calf muscles and eye movement in a healthy volunteer were acquired. Results Both the numerical simulation and the in vivo tagged data demonstrated the algorithm's ability for automated segmentation of single-shot tagged MR provided that SNR of the images is above 10 and the amount of deformation does not exceed the tag spacing. The latter constraint can be met by adjusting the tag delay or the tag spacing. Conclusion The scale space based algorithm for automatic segmentation of single-shot tagged MR enables the application of tagged MR to complex (shearing) deformation and the processing of datasets with relatively low SNR.",physics,physics.med-ph,An Empirical Study of the Relation Between Community Structure and Transitivity,"One of the most prominent properties in real-world networks is the presence of a community structure, i.e. dense and loosely interconnected groups of nodes called communities. In an attempt to better understand this concept, we study the relationship between the strength of the community structure and the network transitivity (or clustering coefficient). Although intuitively appealing, this analysis was not performed before. We adopt an approach based on random models to empirically study how one property varies depending on the other. It turns out the transitivity increases with the community structure strength, and is also affected by the distribution of the community sizes. Furthermore, increasing the transitivity also results in a stronger community structure. More surprisingly, if a very weak community structure causes almost zero transitivity, the opposite is not true and a network with a close to zero transitivity can still have a clearly defined community structure. Further analytical work is necessary to characterize the exact nature of the identified relationship.",physics,physics.soc-ph,0
Temporal Evolution of Spatially-Resolved Individual Star Spots on a Planet-Hosting Solar-type Star: Kepler 17,"Star spot evolution is visible evidence of the emergence/decay of the magnetic field on stellar surface, and it is therefore important for the understanding of the underlying stellar dynamo and consequential stellar flares. In this paper, we report the temporal evolution of individual star spot area on the hot-Jupiter-hosting active solar-type star Kepler 17 whose transits occur every 1.5 days. The spot longitude and area evolution are estimated (1) from the stellar rotational modulations of Kepler data and (2) from the brightness enhancements during the exoplanet transits caused by existence of large star spots. As a result of the comparison, number of spots, spot locations, and the temporal evolution derived from the rotational modulations is largely different from those of in-transit spots. We confirm that although only two light curve minima appear per rotation, there are clearly many spots present on the star. We find that the observed differential intensity changes are sometimes consistent with the spot pattern detected by transits, but they sometimes do not match with each other. Although the temporal evolution derived from the rotational modulation differs from those of in-transit spots to a certain degree, the emergence/decay rates of in-transit spots are within an order of magnitude of those derived for sunspots as well as our previous research based only on rotational modulations. This supports a hypothesis that the emergence/decay of sunspots and extremely-large star spots on solar-type stars occur through the same underlying processes.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Temperature Fluctuations as a Source of Brown Dwarf Variability,"A number of brown dwarfs are now known to be variable with observed amplitudes as large as 10-30% at some wavelengths. While spatial inhomogeneities in cloud coverage and thickness are likely responsible for much of the observed variability, it is possible that some of the variations arise from atmospheric temperature fluctuations instead of, or in addition to, clouds. To better understand the role that thermal variability might play we present a case study of brown dwarf variability using a newly-developed one-dimensional, time-stepping model of atmospheric thermal structure. We focus on the effects of thermal perturbations, intentionally simplifying the problem through omission of clouds and atmospheric circulation. Model results demonstrate that thermal perturbations occurring deep in the atmosphere (at pressures greater than 10 bar) of a model T-dwarf can be communicated to the upper atmosphere through radiative heating via the windows in near-infrared water opacity. The response time depends on where in the atmosphere a thermal perturbation is introduced. We show that, for certain periodic perturbations, the emission spectrum can have complex, time- and wavelength-dependent behaviors, including phase shifts in times of maximum flux observed at different wavelengths. Since different wavelengths probe different levels in the atmosphere, these variations track a wavelength-dependent set of radiative exchanges happening between different atmospheric levels as a perturbation evolves in time. We conclude that thermal--as well as cloud--fluctuations must be considered as possible contributors to the observed brown dwarf variability.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,0
Eigenrays in 3D heterogeneous anisotropic media: Part IV -- Geometric spreading from traveltime Hessian,"Considering 3D heterogeneous anisotropic media, in Part III of this study we obtain the finite-element solution for the stationary ray path between two fixed endpoints using the finite element approach. It involves computation of the global (all-node) traveltime gradient vector and Hessian matrix, with respect to the nodal location and direction components. The global traveltime Hessian of the resolved stationary ray also plays an important role for obtaining the dynamic characteristics along the ray. It is a band matrix that includes the spatial, directional and mixed second derivatives of the traveltime at all nodes and nodal pairs. In Parts V, VI and VII of this study we explicitly use the global traveltime Hessian for solving the dynamic ray tracing equation, to obtain the geometric spreading at each point along the ray. Moreover, the dynamic ray tracing makes it possible to identify/classify caustics along the ray. In this part (Part IV) we propose an original two-stage approach for computing the relative geometric spreading of the entire ray path without explicitly performing the dynamic ray tracing. The first stage consists of an efficient algorithm for reducing the already computed global traveltime Hessian into a endpoint spatial traveltime Hessian. The second stage involves application of a known workflow for computing the geometrical spreading using the endpoint traveltime Hessian. Note that the method proposed in this part (Part IV) does not deliver information about caustics, nor the geometric spreading at intermediate points of the stationary ray path. Throughout the examples presented in Part VII we demonstrate the accuracy of the method proposed in this part over a set of isotropic and anisotropic examples by comparing the geometric spreading computed from this method based on the traveltime Hessian reduction with the one computed from the dynamic ray tracing.",physics,physics.geo-ph,Fabrication of porous microrings via laser printing and ion-beam post-etching,"Pulsed-laser dry printing of noble-metal microrings with a tunable internal porous structure, which can be revealed via an ion-beam etching post-procedure, was demonstrated.

The fabricated porous microrings were shown to provide many-fold near-field enhancement of incident electromagnetic fields, which was confirmed by mapping of the characteristic Raman band of a nanometer-thick covering layer of Rhodamine 6G dye molecules and supporting finite-difference time-domain calculations.

We make use of accurate structural parameters derived from i-band bulge/disc/bar decompositions to show that, as a population, barred discs tend to have fainter central surface brightness (Delta mu_0 ~ 0.25 mag), and disc scale lengths that are ~15 per cent larger than those of unbarred galaxies of the same stellar mass. The corresponding distributions of mu_0 and h are statistically inconsistent at the 5.2 sigma and 3.8 sigma levels, respectively. Bars rarely occur in high-surface brightness discs, with less than 5 per cent of the barred population having mu_0 < 19.5 mag arcsec^-2 -- compared to 20 per cent for unbarred galaxies. They tend to reside in moderately blue discs, with a bar fraction that peaks at (g-i)_disc ~ 0.95 mag and mildly declines for both bluer and redder colours. These results demonstrate noticeable structural differences between the discs of barred and unbarred galaxies, which we argue are the result of bar-driven evolution -- in qualitative agreement with longstanding theoretical expectations.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
Viscosity and thermodynamic properties of QGP in relativistic heavy ion collisions,"We study the viscosity and thermodynamic properties of QGP at RHIC by employing the recently extracted equilibrium distribution functions from two hot QCD equations of state of $O(g^5)$ and $O(g^6\ln(1/g))$ respectively. After obtaining the temperature dependence of energy density, and entropy density, we focus our attention on the determination of shear viscosity for a rapidly expanding interacting plasma, as a function of temperature.

Machine learning for online sea ice bias correction within global ice-ocean simulations,"In this study we perform online sea ice bias correction within a GFDL global ice-ocean model. For this, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) which was developed in a previous study (Gregory et al., 2023) for the purpose of predicting sea ice concentration (SIC) data assimilation (DA) increments. An initial implementation of the CNN shows systematic improvements in SIC biases relative to the free-running model, however large summertime errors remain. We show that these residual errors can be significantly improved with a data augmentation approach, in which sequential CNN and DA corrections are applied to a new simulation over the training period. This then provides a new training data set with which to refine the weights of the initial network. We propose that this machine-learned correction scheme could be utilized for generating improved initial conditions, and also for real-time sea ice bias correction within seasonal-to-subseasonal sea ice forecasts.",physics,physics.ao-ph,Method comparison for simulating non-Gaussian Beams and Diffraction for Precision Interferometry,"In the context of simulating precision laser interferometers, we compare via several examples two wavefront decomposition methods: the Mode Expansion Method (MEM) and the Gaussian beam decomposition (GBD) for their precision and applicability. To judge the performance of these methods, we define different types of errors and study their properties. We specify how the two methods can be fairly compared and based on that, the quality of the MEM and GBD are compared in several examples. We test here cases for which analytic results are available, i.e., non-clipped circular and general astigmatic Gaussian beams, as well as clipped circular Gaussian beams, in the near-, far-, and extreme far-field of millions of kilometers occurring in space-gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, we compare the methods for aberrated wavefronts and the interaction with optical components by testing reflections from differently curved mirrors. We find that both methods can be generally used for decomposing non-Gaussian beams. However, which method is more accurate depends on the optical system and simulation settings. In the given examples, the MEM more accurately describes non-clipped Gaussian beams, while for clipped Gaussian beams and the interaction with surfaces, the GBD is more precise.",physics,physics.optics,0
PANDA Phase One,"The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany, provides unique possibilities for a new generation of hadron-, nuclear- and atomic physics experiments. The future antiProton ANnihilations at DArmstadt (PANDA or $\overline{\rm P}$ANDA) experiment at FAIR will offer a broad physics programme, covering different aspects of the strong interaction. Understanding the latter in the non-perturbative regime remains one of the greatest challenges in contemporary physics. The antiproton-nucleon interaction studied with PANDA provides crucial tests in this area. Furthermore, the high-intensity, low-energy domain of PANDA allows for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, e.g. through high precision symmetry tests. This paper takes into account a staged approach for the detector setup and for the delivered luminosity from the accelerator. The available detector setup at the time of the delivery of the first antiproton beams in the HESR storage ring is referred to as the \textit{Phase One} setup.

Consistent with this approach we suggest key experiments which should tell us unambiguously whether there is such a change in the structure of a bound nucleon. We also briefly report on extremely promising recent calculations of the structure of nuclei across the periodic table based upon this idea.,nucl,nucl-th,0
Stationary and oscillatory bound states of dissipative solitons created by the third-order dispersion,"We consider the model of fiber-laser cavities near the zero-dispersion point, based on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with the cubic-quintic nonlinearity, including the third-order dispersion (TOD) term. It is well known that this model supports stable dissipative solitons. We demonstrate that the same model gives rise to several families of robust bound states of the solitons, which exists only in the presence of the TOD. There are both stationary and dynamical bound states, with oscillating separation between the bound solitons. Stationary states are multistable, corresponding to different values of the separation. With the increase of the TOD coefficient, the bound state with the smallest separation gives rise the oscillatory state through the Hopf bifurcation. Further growth of TOD leads to a bifurcation transforming the oscillatory limit cycle into a strange attractor, which represents a chaotically oscillating dynamical bound state. Families of multistable three- and four-soliton complexes are found too, the ones with the smallest separation between the solitons again ending by a transition to oscillatory states through the Hopf bifurcation.",nlin,nlin.PS,On a method for constructing the Lax pairs for integrable models via quadratic ansatz,A method for constructing the Lax pairs for nonlinear integrable models is suggested. First we look for a nonlinear invariant manifold to the linearization of the given equation. Examples show that such invariant manifold does exist and can effectively be found. Actually it is defined by a quadratic form. As a result we get a nonlinear Lax pair consisting of the linearized equation and the invariant manifold. Our second step consists of finding an appropriate change of the variables to linearize the found nonlinear Lax pair. The desired change of the variables is again defined by a quadratic form. The method is illustrated by the well-known KdV equation and the modified Volterra chain. New Lax pairs are found. The formal asymptotic expansions for their eigenfunctions are constructed around the singular values of the spectral parameter. By applying the method of the formal diagonalization to these Lax pairs the infinite series of the local conservation laws are obtained for the corresponding nonlinear models.,nlin,nlin.SI,0
Curing Braess' Paradox by Secondary Control in Power Grids,"Robust operation of power transmission grids is essential for most of today's technical infrastructure and our daily life. Adding renewable generation to power grids requires grid extensions and sophisticated control actions on different time scales to cope with short-term fluctuations and long-term power imbalance. Braess' paradox constitutes a counterintuitive collective phenomenon that occurs if adding new transmission line capacity to a network increases loads on other lines, effectively reducing the system's performance and potentially even entirely removing its operating state. Combining simple analytical considerations with numerical investigations on a small sample network, we here study dynamical consequences of secondary control in AC power grid models. We demonstrate that sufficiently strong control not only implies dynamical stability of the system but may also cure Braess' paradox. Our results highlight the importance of demand control in conjunction with grid topology for stable operation and reveal a new functional benefit of secondary control.",nlin,nlin.AO,On the Spatial Asymptotics of Solutions of the Toda Lattice,"We investigate the spatial asymptotics of decaying solutions of the Toda hierarchy and show that the asymptotic behaviour is preserved by the time evolution.

We processed the observational data on NOAA 11711 active region and found oscillations propagating from the photospheric level through the transition region upward into the corona. The power maps of low-frequency (1--2 mHz) oscillations reproduce well the fan-like coronal structures visible in the Fe ix 171A line. High frequency oscillations (5--7 mHz) propagate along the vertical magnetic field lines and concentrate inside small-scale elements in the umbra and at the umbra-penumbra boundary. We investigated the dependence of the dominant oscillation frequency upon the distance from the sunspot barycentre to estimate inclination of magnetic tubes in higher levels of sunspots where it cannot be measured directly, and found that this angle is close to 40 degrees above the umbra boundaries in the transition region.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,0

Regardless of the dissipation strength, we find clear evidence for universal scaling, with dynamical critical exponent $z$ characterising the growth of the correlation length. In the dissipative limit we find growth consistent with the logarithmically corrected law $[t/\log(t/t_0)]^{1/z}$, and exponent $z=2$, in agreement with previous studies. Decreasing the dissipation towards the conservative limit, we find strong numerical evidence for the expected growth law $t^{1/z}$. However, we observe a smooth crossover in $z$ that converges to an anomalous value distinctly lower than $2$ at a small finite dissipation strength. We show that this lower exponent may be attributable to a power-law vortex mobility arising from vortex--sound interactions.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,0

Coherent Multiple Backscattering of Waves in Random Medium beyond the Diffusion Approximation,"In this paper the validity of the diffusion approximation for multiple scattering of classical waves in random medium in different regimes is investigated, with emphasize to weak localization effects. Many principle topics are discussed once again. We obtain new expressions for the incoherent and coherent multiple scattering intensities for the more general case of large scattering angles and various observation points inside the medium with moving scatterers and absorption. (The results, we reached, assuming white-noise disorder for the impurities correlator, contain one-dimensional integration in its final analytical form). Also new self-consistent formulas for incoherent and coherent intensities for fixed multiplicity orders of scattering are given and their lineshapes are graphically represented. Through these formulas we clearly demonstrate that the impurities motion reduces the contribution to the intensity of the scatterings with large multiplicity orders. The total scattering intensities in $4\pi$ solid angle are calculated for the general case and compared with their diffusion approximation. For coherent intensities it is shown that a drastic deviation from the exact results occurs. It turns out that the region of angles, for which the observed lineshape of the weak localization effect tends to the incoherent background, give the main contribution to the total coherent scattered intensity. The last quantity happens to depend linearly instead of predicted quadratic dependence on the perturbation parameter, 1/kl.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,The thickness of a liquid layer on the free surface of ice as obtained from computer simulation,"Molecular dynamic simulations were performed for ice Ih with a free surface by using four water models, SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ice and TIP4P/2005. The behavior of the basal plane, the primary prismatic plane and of the secondary prismatic plane when exposed to vacuum was analyzed. We observe the formation of a thin liquid layer at the ice surface at temperatures below the melting point for all models and the three planes considered. For a given plane it was found that the thickness of a liquid layer was similar for different water models, when the comparison is made at the same undercooling with respect to the melting point of the model. The liquid layer thickness is found to increase with temperature. For a fixed temperature it was found that the thickness of the liquid layer decreases in the following order: the basal plane, the primary prismatic plane, and the secondary prismatic plane. For the TIP4P/Ice model, a model reproducing the experimental value of the melting temperature of ice, the first clear indication of the formation of a liquid layer appears at about -100 Celsius for the basal plane, at about -80 Celsius for the primary prismatic plane and at about -70 Celsius for the secondary prismatic plane.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,0
Point-Form Hamiltonian Dynamics and Applications,This short review summarizes recent developments and results in connection with point-form dynamics of relativistic quantum systems. We discuss a Poincare invariant multichannel formalism which describes particle production and annihilation via vertex interactions that are derived from field theoretical interaction densities. We sketch how this rather general formalism can be used to derive electromagnetic form factors of confined quark-antiquark systems. As a further application it is explained how the chiral constituent quark model leads to hadronic states that can be considered as bare hadrons dressed by meson loops. Within this approach hadron resonances acquire a finite (non-perturbative) decay width. We will also discuss the point-form dynamics of quantum fields. After recalling basic facts of the free-field case we will address some quantum field theoretical problems for which canonical quantization on a space-time hyperboloid could be advantageous.,nucl,nucl-th,Third moments of conserved charges as probes of QCD phase structure,"The third moments of conserved charges, the baryon and electric charge numbers, and energy, as well as their mixed moments, carry more information on the state around the QCD phase boundary than previously proposed fluctuation observables and higher order moments.

While, for the present, calculations within the framework of lattice QCD are limited to relatively large quark mass, there has been considerable progress in our understanding of how to extrapolate to the chiral limit. Here we report the results of the application of these techniques to the most recent form factor data from the QCDSF Collaboration.

General synthetic iterative scheme for unsteady rarefied gas flows,"In rarefied gas flows, the spatial grid size could vary by several orders of magnitude in a single flow configuration (e.g., inside the Knudsen layer it is at the order of mean free path of gas molecules, while in the bulk region it is at a much larger hydrodynamic scale). Therefore, efficient implicit numerical method is urgently needed for time-dependent problems. However, the integro-differential nature of gas kinetic equations poses a grand challenge, as the gain part of the collision operator is non-invertible. Hence an iterative solver is required in each time step, which usually takes a lot of iterations in the (near) continuum flow regime where the Knudsen number is small; worse still, the solution does not asymptotically preserve the fluid dynamic limit when the spatial cell size is not refined enough. Inspired by our general synthetic iteration scheme for steady-state solution of the Boltzmann equation, we propose two numerical schemes to push the multiscale simulation of unsteady rarefied gas flows to a new boundary, that is, the numerical solution not only converges within dozens of iterations in each time step, but also asymptotic preserves the Navier-Stokes-Fourier limit at coarse spatial grid, even when the time step is large (e.g., in the extreme slow decay of two-dimensional Taylor vortex, the time step is at the order of vortex decay time).

The defects in the nematic ordering are coupled to the shape of the cell tiling, affecting cell areas and coordinations. This intricate interplay between cell shape, size, and coordination provides a possible mechanism by which tissues could spontaneously develop long-range polarity through local mechanical forces without resorting to long-range chemical patterning.",physics,physics.bio-ph,0
Low-frequency Current Fluctuations in Individual Semiconducting Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes,"We present a systematic study on low-frequency current fluctuations of nano-devices consisting of one single semiconducting nanotube, which exhibit significant 1/f-type noise. By examining devices with different switching mechanisms, carrier types (electrons vs. holes), and channel lengths, we show that the 1/f fluctuation level in semiconducting nanotubes is correlated to the total number of transport carriers present in the system. However, the 1/f noise level per carrier is not larger than that of most bulk conventional semiconductors, e.g. Si. The pronounced noise level observed in nanotube devices simply reflects on the small number of carriers involved in transport. These results not only provide the basis to quantify the noise behavior in a one-dimensional transport system, but also suggest a valuable way to characterize low-dimensional nanostructures based on the 1/f fluctuation phenomenon.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,Localization in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and flux-line pinning in superconductors,A recent development in studies of random non-Hermitian quantum systems is reviewed.

Relations between the delocalization transition and the complex energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian systems are described.

"Glauber-model analysis of total reaction cross sections for Ne, Mg, Si, and S isotopes with Skyrme-Hartree-Fock densities","A systematic analysis is made on the total reaction cross sections for Ne, Mg, Si, and S isotopes. The high-energy nucleus-nucleus collision is described based on the Glauber model. Using the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method in the three-dimensional grid-space representation, we determine the nuclear density distribution for a wide range of nuclei self-consistently without assuming any spatial symmetry. The calculated total reaction cross sections consistently agree with the recent cross section data on Ne$+^{12}$C collision at 240$A$\,MeV, which makes it possible to discuss the radius and deformation of the isotopes. The total reaction cross sections for Mg$+^{12}$C, Si$+^{12}$C and S$+^{12}$C cases are predicted for future measurements. We also find that the high-energy cross section data for O, Ne, and Mg isotopes on a $^{12}$C target at around 1000\,$A$MeV can not be reproduced consistently with the corresponding data at 240\,$A$MeV.",nucl,nucl-ex,Shrunk halo and quenched shell gap at $N=16$ in $^{22}$C: Inversion of $sd$ states and deformation effects,"We investigate the ground state properties of $^{22}$C by using a deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model in continuum and explore the interplays among the formation of a halo, deformation effects, the inversion of $sd$ states, the shell evolution, and changes of nuclear magicities. It is revealed that there is an inversion between the two spherical orbitals $2s_{1/2}$ and $1d_{5/2}$ in $^{22}$C compared with the conventional single particle shell structure in stable nuclei. This inversion, together with deformation effects, results in a shrunk halo and a quenched shell gap at $N=16$. It is predicted that the core of $^{22}$C is oblate but the halo is prolate. Therefore several exotic nuclear phenomena, including the halo, the shape decoupling effects, the inversion of $sd$ states, and the evolution of shell structure which results in (dis)appearance of magic numbers, coexist in one single nucleus $^{22}\mathrm{C}$.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Planck 2018 and Brane Inflation Revisited,"We revisit phenomenological as well as string-theoretical aspects of D-brane inflation cosmological models. Phenomenologically these models stand out on par with $\alpha$-attractors, as models with Planck-compatible values of $n_s$, moving down to the sweet spot in the data with decreasing value of $r$.

The CME leading edge and an arc-shaped {\emph{concave-up} structure near the core} was tracked in WISPR~field of view using the polar coordinate system, for the first time. Using the impact distance on Thomson surface, we measured average speeds of CME leading edge and concave-up structure as $\approx$2500~$\pm$~270\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and $\approx$400~$\pm$~70\,km\,s$^{-1}$ with a deceleration of $\approx$20~m~s$^{-2}$ for the later. {The use of the plane-of-sky approach yielded an unrealistic speed of more than three times of this estimate.} We also used single viewpoint STEREO/COR-2A images to fit the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to the CME while incorporating the source region location from EUI of Solar Orbiter and estimated a 3D speed of $\approx$2700\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We conclude that this CME exhibits the highest speed during the ascending phase of solar cycle 25. This places it in the category of extreme speed CMEs, which account for only 0.15\% of all CMEs listed in the CDAW CME catalog.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,0
Search for the Chiral Magnetic Wave with Anisotropic Flow of Identified Particles at RHIC-STAR,"The chiral magnetic wave (CMW) has been theorized to propagate in the Quark-Gluon Plasma formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It could cause a finite electric quadrupole moment of the collision system, and may be observed as a dependence of elliptic flow, $v_{2}$, on the asymmetry between positively and negatively charged hadrons, $A_{\rm ch}$. However, non-CMW mechanisms, such as local charge conservation (LCC) and hydrodynamics with isospin effect, could also contribute to the experimental observations. Here we present the STAR measurements of elliptic flow $v_{2}$ and triangular flow $v_{3}$ of charged pions, along with $v_{2}$ of charged kaons and protons, as functions of $A_{\rm ch}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The slope parameters of $\Delta v_{2}$($A_{\rm ch}$) and $\Delta v_{3}$($A_{\rm ch}$) are reported and compared to investigate the LCC background. The similarity between pion and kaon slopes suggests that the hydrodynamics is not the dominant mechanism. The difference between the normalized $\Delta v_{2}$ and $\Delta v_{3}$ slopes, together with the small slopes in p+Au and d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV, suggest that the CMW picture remains a viable interpretation at RHIC.",nucl,nucl-ex,Classical gluodynamics in curved space--time and the soft Pomeron,"QCD at the classical level possesses scale invariance which is broken by quantum effects. This ``dimensional transmutation'' phenomenon can be mathematically described by formulating classical gluodynamics in a curved, conformally flat, space-time with non-vanishing cosmological constant. We study QCD high-energy scattering in this theory. We find that the properties of the scattering amplitude at small momentum transfer are determined by the energy density of vacuum fluctuations. The approach gives rise to the power growth of the total hadron-hadron cross section with energy, i.e. the Pomeron. The intercept of the Pomeron and the multiplicity of produced particles are evaluated. We also speculate about a possible link between conformal anomaly and TeV scale quantum gravity.",nucl,nucl-th,0

Light tunneling inhibition in longitudinally modulated Bragg-guiding arrays,We consider waveguide array in which defect channels with reduced refractive index are spaced periodically and the light guiding is achieved due to Bragg reflection.

Additionally, we choose a variant of the Ulam method to numerically approximate the Perron-Frobenius operator for the map, allowing us to calculate the anomalous diffusion exponent via an eigenvalue problem, compared to the solution of the Fractional Diffusion Equation. The results here corroborate other findings in the literature of anomalous transport in Hamiltonian maps and can be suitable to describe transport properties of other dynamical systems.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Vortex Fluctuations in High-Tc Films: Flux Noise Spectrum and Complex Impedance,"The flux noise spectrum and complex impedance for a 500 {\AA} thick YBCO film are measured and compared with predictions for two dimensional vortex fluctuations. It is verified that the complex impedance and the flux noise spectra are proportional to each other, that the logarithm of the flux noise spectra for different temperatures has a common tangent with slope $\approx -1$, and that the amplitude of the noise decreases as $d^{-3}$, where $d$ is the height above the film at which the magnetic flux is measured.

This allows one to convert optical spectroscopic data (photoluminescence spectrum and absorbance edge) into accurate estimates for the particle size distributions of colloidal systems even if the traditional effective mass model is expected to fail, which occurs typically for very small particles belonging to the so-called strong confinement limit. By applying the reported theoretical methodologies to CdTe nanocrystals synthesized through wet chemical routes, size distributions are inferred and compared directly to those obtained from atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. This analysis can be used as a complementary tool for the characterization of nanocrystal samples of many other systems such as the II-VI and III-V semiconductor materials.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,0
On the theory of light scattering in molecular liquids,"The theory of light scattering for a system of linear molecules with anisotropic polarizabilities is considered. As a starting point for our theory, we express the result of a scattering experiment in VV and VH symmetry as dynamic correlation functions of tensorial densities $\rho_{lm}(q)$ with $l=0$ and $l=2$. $l$, $m$ denote indices of spherical harmonics. To account for all observed hydrodynamic singularities, a generalization of the theory of Schilling and Scheidsteger \cite{schilling97} for these correlation functions is presented, which is capable to describe the light scattering experiments from the liquid regime to the glassy state. As a microscopic theory it fulfills all sum rules contrary to previous {\em phenomenological} theories. We emphasize the importance of the helicity index $m$ for the microscopic theory by showing, that only the existence of $m=1$ components lead to the well known Rytov dip in liquids and to the appearance of transversal sound waves in VH symmetry in the deeply supercooled liquid and the glass. Exact expressions for the phenomenological frequency dependent rotation translation coupling coefficients of previous theories are derived.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Visualizing the periodic modulation of Cooper pairing in a severely underdoped cuprate,"A major obstacle in understanding the mechanism of Cooper pairing in the cuprates is the existence of various intertwined orders associated with spin, charge, and Cooper pairs. Of particular importance is the ubiquitous charge order features that have been observed in a variety of cuprates, especially in the underdoped regime of the phase diagram. To explain the origin of the charge order and its implication to the superconducting phase, many theoretical models have been proposed, such as charge stripes, electronic nematicity, and Fermi surface instability. A highly appealing physical picture is the so-called pair density wave (PDW), a periodic modulation of Cooper paring in space, which may also induce a charge order. To elucidate the existence and nature of the PDW order, here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to investigate a severely underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}, in which superconductivity just emerges on top of a pronounced checkerboard charge order. By analyzing the spatial distribution of the spectral features characteristic of superconductivity, we observe a periodic modulation of both the superconducting coherence peak and gap depth, demonstrating the existence of a density wave order of Cooper pairing. The PDW order has the same spatial periodicity as the charge order, and the amplitudes of the two orders exhibit clear positive correlation. These results shed important new lights on the origin of and interplay between the charge order and Cooper pairing modulation in the cuprates.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,0

Using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV, the world's best sensitivity to CP violation in this decay is obtained.

For the real part, these contributions turn out to be related to the box diagram with up quarks but, unlike in perturbation theory, they do not vanish in the limit m_u->0. They increase the leading contribution to the K_L-K_S mass difference by ~10%. This means that short distances amount to (90+-15)% of this mass difference. For the imaginary part, we find a correction to the lambda_c^2 m_c^2 term of -5% from the integration of charm, which is a small contribution to epsilon_K.

In particular, the bump-like structure at the photon energy E_gamma \approx 2.3$ GeV is well explained by the K Lambda(1520) rescattering amplitude in the intermediate state, which is the dominant contribution among other hadronic contributions.

The small-size MA cores with outer diameter >100 mm have been supplied by Chinese firms, and the properties of cores are tested and show good consistency with Hitachi material. Based on the MA cores testing results, the schematic design of a cavity is conducted, which could obtain 1 kV gap voltage with less than 1.5 kW power dissipation in the frequency range of 0.5~7 MHz.

The equations of motion are based on a nonlinear connection modified by the action of an orthogonal tensor which synchronizes the 4-velocities of the considered two bodies.

Signal Improvement and Contrast Enhancement in Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"This thesis reports advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with the ultimate goal of improving signal and contrast in biomedical applications. More specifically, novel MRI pulse sequences have been designed to characterize microstructure, enhance signal and contrast in tissue, and image functional processes. In this thesis, rat brain and red bone marrow images are acquired using iMQCs (intermolecular multiple quantum coherences) between intermediate separated spins. As an important application, iMQCs images in different directions can be used for anisotropy mapping and tissue microstructure analysis. At the same time, the simulations prove that the dipolar field from the overall shape only has small contributions to the experimental iMQC signal. Besides magnitude of iMQCs, phase of iMQCs should be studied as well. The phase anisotropy maps built by our method can clearly show susceptibility information in rat brain. It may provide meaningful diagnostic information. To deeply study susceptibility, the modified-crazed sequence is developed. Combining phase data of modified-crazed images and phase data of iMQCs images is very promising to construct microstructure maps. Obviously, the phase image in all above techniques needs to be highly-contrasted and clear.

Under the assumption of long (compared to the radius) blood vessels the Navier-Stokes equations are reduced, to a simpler model consistently with lubrication theory. Under these assumptions, analytical results are compared for Newtonian, power-law, Carreau and Ellis fluids, and these clearly demonstrate the importance of shear thinning effects when modelling blood flow. Incorporating nanoparticles and a magnetic field to the model we develop a numerical scheme and study the particle motion for different field strengths. We demonstrate the importance of the non-Newtonian behaviour: for the flow regimes investigated in this work, consistent with those in blood micro vessels, we find that the field strength needed to absorb a certain amount of particles in a non-Newtonian fluid has to be larger than the one needed in a Newtonian fluid. Specifically, for one case examined, a two times larger magnetic force had to be applied in the Ellis fluid than in the Newtonian fluid for the same number of particles to be absorbed through the vessel wall. Consequently, models based on a Newtonian fluid can drastically overestimate the effect of a magnetic field. Finally, we evaluate the particle concentration at the vessel wall and compute the evolution of the particle flux through the wall for different permeability values, as that is important when assessing the efficacy of drug delivery applications. The insights from our work bring us a step closer to successfully transferring magnetic nanoparticle drug delivery to the clinic.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,0
Surface ferromagnetism in a chiral topological semimetal CoSi,"Despite the chiral topological semimetal CoSi is known as bulk diamagnetic, it shows unusual surface ferromagnetism of debatable origin. The ferromagnetic ordering has been attributed to the distorted bonds, the superlattice of ordered vacancies, or even to topological surface textures due to the spin polarization in the neighboring Fermi arcs. We experimentally compare magnetization reversal curves for initially oxidized CoSi single crystals and cleaved samples with a fresh, oxide-free surface. While the oxidized CoSi samples do not show sizable ferromagnetism, the fresh CoSi surface gives a strong ferromagnetic response, which is accompanied by the pronounced modulation of the angle dependence of magnetization, as it can be expected for easy and hard axes in a ferromagnet. In addition to the first order reversal curves analysis, this observation allows us to distinguish between different mechanisms of the ferromagnetic ordering in CoSi single crystals. We conclude that the surface states-induced RKKY interaction between distorted bonds near the sample surface is responsible for the strong ferromagnetic multi-domain behavior for freshly cleaved samples.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Non-Gaussian fluctuations of a probe coupled to a Gaussian field,"The motion of a colloidal probe in a complex fluid, such as a micellar solution, is usually described by the generalized Langevin equation, which is linear. However, recent numerical simulations and experiments have shown that this linear model fails when the probe is confined, and that the intrinsic dynamics of the probe is actually non-linear. Noting that the kurtosis of the displacement of the probe may reveal the non-linearity of its dynamics also in the absence confinement, we compute it for a probe coupled to a Gaussian field and possibly trapped by a harmonic potential. We show that the excess kurtosis increases from zero at short times, reaches a maximum, and then decays algebraically at long times, with an exponent which depends on the spatial dimensionality and on the features and correlations of the dynamics of the field. Our analytical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the stochastic dynamics of the probe and the field where the latter is represented by a finite number of modes.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,0
First $\pi K$ atom lifetime and $\pi K$ scattering length measurements,The results of a search for hydrogen-like atoms consisting of $\pi^{\mp}K^{\pm}$ mesons are presented. Evidence for $\pi K$ atom production by 24 GeV/c protons from CERN PS interacting with a nickel target has been seen in terms of characteristic $\pi K$ pairs from their breakup in the same target ($178 \pm 49$) and from Coulomb final state interaction ($653 \pm 42$). Using these results the analysis yields a first value for the $\pi K$ atom lifetime of $\tau=(2.5_{-1.8}^{+3.0})$ fs and a first model-independent measurement of the S-wave isospin-odd $\pi K$ scattering length $\left|a_0^-\right|=\frac{1}{3}\left|a_{1/2}-a_{3/2}\right|= \left(0.11_{-0.04}^{+0.09} \right)M_{\pi}^{-1}$ ($a_I$ for isospin $I$).,hep,hep-ex,"Decuplets, glueballs and nonet anomalies",A new approach to problem of glueball search is presented. It refers to early J. Rosner's attempts to detect the tensor glueball. In the present description the glueball state is treated on equal footing with singlet $q\bar{q}$ one. Mixing glueball with $q\bar{q}$ nonet creates decuplet. Glueball can be detected as its component. Our approach is based on hypothesis of vanishing exotic commutators described as VEC model. The model describes all multiplets of light mesons. This makes possible to compare the mass patterns of different multiplets. According to VEC description some abnormal nonets can be interpreted as incomplete decuplets. This makes possible to relate the anomaly of the nonet to a glueball component of decuplet. The model reflects rich diversity of strong interaction properties. The treatment presented is quite elementary: only masses of physical states are required to be known.,hep,hep-ph,0
Successive cohorts of Twitter users show increasing activity and shrinking content horizons,"The global public sphere has changed dramatically over the past decades: a significant part of public discourse now takes place on algorithmically driven platforms owned by a handful of private companies. Despite its growing importance, there is scant large-scale academic research on the long-term evolution of user behaviour on these platforms, because the data are often proprietary to the platforms. Here, we evaluate the individual behaviour of 600,000 Twitter users between 2012 and 2019 and find empirical evidence for an acceleration of the way Twitter is used on an individual level. This manifests itself in the fact that cohorts of Twitter users behave differently depending on when they joined the platform. Behaviour within a cohort is relatively consistent over time and characterised by strong internal interactions, but over time behaviour from cohort to cohort shifts towards increased activity. Specifically, we measure this in terms of more tweets per user over time, denser interactions with others via retweets, and shorter content horizons, expressed as an individual's decaying autocorrelation of topics over time. Our observations are explained by a growing proportion of active users who not only tweet more actively but also elicit more retweets. These behaviours suggest a collective contribution to an increased flow of information through each cohort's news feed -- an increase that potentially depletes available collective attention over time. Our findings complement recent, empirical work on social acceleration, which has been largely agnostic about individual user activity.",physics,physics.soc-ph,Vibronic exciton theory of singlet fission.

Two-dimensional spectroscopic detection of the correlated triplet pair state,"Singlet fission, the molecular process through which photons are effectively converted into pairs of lower energy triplet excitons, holds promise as a means of boosting photovoltaic device efficiencies. In the preceding article of this series, we formulated a vibronic theory of singlet fission, inspired by previous experimental and theoretical studies suggesting that vibronic coupling plays an important role in fission dynamics. Here, we extend our model in order to simulate two-dimensional electronic spectra, through which the theory is further validated based on a comparison to recent measurements on pentacene crystals. Moreover, by means of such spectral simulations, we provide new insights into the nature of the correlated triplet pair state, the first product intermediate in the fission process. In particular, we address a disagreement in the literature regarding the identification, energies, and transition dipole moments of its optical transitions towards higher-lying triplet states.",physics,physics.chem-ph,0
"Intermittency, chaos and singular fluctuations in the mixed Obukhov-Novikov shell model of turbulence","The multiscaling properties of the mixed Obukhov-Novikov shell model of turbulence are investigated numerically and compared with those of the complex GOY model, mostly studied in the recent years. Two types of generic singular fluctuations are identified~: first, self-similar solutions propagating from large to small scales and building up intermittency, second, complex time singularities inhibiting the cascade and promoting chaos. A simple and robust method is proposed to track these objects. It is shown that the scaling exponent of self-similar solutions selected by the dynamics is compatible with large order statistics whenever it departs enough from the Kolmogorov value. Complex time singularities on the other hand get trapped on the last shells, when the proportion of Novikov interactions exceeds a critical value which is argued to mark the boundary between chaotic and regular dynamics in the limit of infinite Reynolds number.",nlin,nlin.CD,Exact traveling wave solutions of 1D parabolic-parabolic models of chemotaxis,In this paper we consider three different 1D parabolic-parabolic systems of chemotaxis.

Pseudoquatum Features of Parametrically Driven Classical Fluids,"Recent experiments on walking droplets suggest an underlying connection between fluid dynamics and the quantum mechanics.

It is shown that the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (NLSE) describes the pseudoquantum features of a given pseudoparticle in the Sagdeev pseudopotential just as the ordinary linear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (LSE) describes the quantum nature of real particles. The NLSE is shown to reduce to nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation (NHJE) for the phase function of the complex wavefunction. The origin of the wave-particle dual-character in both LSE and NLSE is explained and basic similarities between the two models is highlighted. It is shown that many more pseudoquantum effects (yet to be explored) such as pseudoentanglement, self-interference effect and quantization of pseudoparticle energy are inherent features of classical fluids. Current investigation suggests that emergence of the quantum nature of fluids is independent from dynamics of the bouncing droplets or their interactions with the surface waves instantaneously created by them. In contrast to previous suggestions, it is remarked that intrinsically nonlinear collective excitations of a fluid can drive any particle even a pseudoparticle to behave quantum mechanically. These collective interactions in hydrodynamic model confirm the important nonlocal character (which is a key aspect of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory) of all the pseudoquantum phenomena. The recent hydrodynamic quantum analog experiments and extensive new theoretical models may hopefully enable physicists to unlock the decade long hidden mystery of the quantum weirdness.",nlin,nlin.PS,Weakly Chaotic Population Dynamics in Random Ecological Networks,"Population dynamics in random ecological networks are investigated by analyzing a simple deterministic equation. It is found that a sequence of abrupt changes of populations punctuating quiescent states characterize the long time behavior. An asymptotic analysis is developed by introducing a log-scaled time, and it is shown that such a dynamical process behaves as non-steady weak chaos in which population disturbances grow algebraically in time. Also, some relevance of our study to taxonomic data of biological extinction is mentioned.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Localization of trivial edge states in InAs/GaSb composite quantum wells,"InAs/GaSb heterostructure is one of the systems where quantum spin Hall effect is predicted to arise. However, as confirmed by recent experimental studies, the most significant highlight of the effect i.e., the conductance quantization due to non-trivial edge states is obscured by spurious conductivity arising from trivial edge states. In this work, we present experimental observation of strong localization of trivial edge modes in an InAs/GaSb heterostructure which was weakly disordered by silicon delta-like dopants within the InAs layer. The edge conduction which is characterized by a temperature-independent behavior at low temperatures and a power law at high temperatures is observed to be exponentially scaled with the length of the edge. Comprehensive analysis on measurements with a range of devices is in agreement with the localization theories in quasi one-dimensional electronic systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Anisotropy parameters of superconducting MgB$_2$,"Data on macroscopic superconducting anisotropy of MgB$_2$ are reviewed. The data are described within a weak coupling two-gaps anisotropic s-wave model of superconductivity. The calculated ratio of the upper critical fields $\gamma_H=H_{c2,ab}/H_{c2,c}$ increases with decreasing temperature in agreement with available data, whereas the calculated ratio of London penetration depths $\gamma_{\lambda}=\lambda_c/\lambda_{ab}$ decreases to reach $\approx 1.1$ at T=0.

Casimir interactions in Ising strips with boundary fields: exact results,An exact statistical mechanical derivation is given of the critical Casimir forces for Ising strips with arbitrary surface fields applied to edges. Our results show that the strength as well as the sign of the force can be controled by varying the temperature or the fields. An interpretation of the results is given in terms of a linked cluster expansion. This suggests a systematic approach for deriving the critical Casimir force which can be used in more general models.,cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Lattice Mechanics of Origami Tessellations,"Origami-based design holds promise for developing materials whose mechanical properties are tuned by crease patterns introduced to thin sheets. Although there has been heuristic developments in constructing patterns with desirable qualities, the bridge between origami and physics has yet to be fully developed. To truly consider origami structures as a class of materials, methods akin to solid mechanics need to be developed to understand their long-wavelength behavior. We introduce here a lattice theory for examining the mechanics of origami tessellations in terms of the topology of their crease pattern and the relationship between the folds at each vertex. This formulation provides a general method for associating mechanical properties with periodic folded structures, and allows for a concrete connection between more conventional materials and the mechanical metamaterials constructed using origami-based design.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,0
Measured proton electromagnetic structure deviates from theoretical predictions,"The visible world is founded on the proton, the only composite building block of matter that is stable in nature. Consequently, understanding the formation of matter relies on explaining the dynamics and the properties of the proton's bound state.A fundamental property of the proton involves the response of the system to an external electromagnetic field. It is characterized by the electromagnetic polarizabilities that describe how easily the charge and magnetization distributions inside the system are distorted by the electromagnetic field. Moreover, the generalized polarizabilities map out the resulting deformation of the densities in a proton subject to an electromagnetic field. They disclose essential information about the underlying system dynamics and provide a key for decoding the proton structure in terms of the theory of the strong interaction that binds its elementary quark and gluon constituents. Of particular interest is a puzzle in the electric generalized polarizability of the proton that remains unresolved for two decades. Here we report measurements of the proton's electromagnetic generalized polarizabilities at low four-momentum transfer squared. We show evidence of an anomaly to the behaviour of the proton's electric generalized polarizability that contradicts the predictions of nuclear theory and derive its signature in the spatial distribution of the induced polarization in the proton. The reported measurements suggest the presence of a new, not-yet-understood dynamical mechanism in the proton and present notable challenges to the nuclear theory.",nucl,nucl-ex,Systematic study of $\mathcal{\alpha}$ decay half-lives based on Gamow--like model with a screened electrostatic barrier,"In the present work we systematically study $\mathcal{\alpha}$ decay half-lives of $Z>51$ nuclei using the modified Gamow-like model which includes the effects of the centrifugal potential and electrostatic shielding. For the case of even-even nuclei, this model contains two adjustable parameters: the parameter $a$ related to the screened electrostatic barrier and the radius constant $r_0$, while for the case of odd-odd and odd-A nuclei, it is added a new parameter i.e. hindrance factor $h$ which is used to describe the effect of an odd-proton and/or an odd-neutron. Our calculations can well reproduce the experimental data. In addition, we use this modified Gamow-like model to predict the $\mathcal{\alpha}$-decay half-lives of seven even-even nuclei with $Z=120$ and some un-synthesized nuclei on their $\mathcal{\alpha}$ decay chains.",nucl,nucl-th,0

G 11, 1055 (1985)] for absolute primary gamma intensities following thermal neutron capture of 171Yb differ in average by a factor of three. We have resolved this conflict in favor of Greenwood et al. by a measurement of primary versus secondary intensities.",nucl,nucl-ex,Effect of finite particle number sampling on baryon number fluctuations,"The effects of finite particle number sampling on the net baryon number cumulants, extracted from fluid dynamical simulations, are studied. The commonly used finite particle number sampling procedure introduces an additional Poissonian (or multinomial if global baryon number conservation is enforced) contribution which increases the extracted moments of the baryon number distribution. If this procedure is applied to a fluctuating fluid dynamics framework one severely overestimates the actual cumulants. We show that the sampling of so called test-particles suppresses the additional contribution to the moments by at least one power of the number of test-particles. We demonstrate this method in a numerical fluid dynamics simulation that includes the effects of spinodal decomposition due to a first order phase transition. Furthermore, in the limit where anti-baryons can be ignored, we derive analytic formulas which capture exactly the effect of particle sampling on the baryon number cumulants. These formulas may be used to test the various numerical particle sampling algorithms.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Width difference in the $B_s$-$\bar{B}_s$ system with lattice NRQCD,"We compute the matrix element of the four-quark operator $\Op_S$ = $\bar{b}(1-\gamma_5) s \bar{b} (1-\gamma_5) s$ in the $B_s-\bar{B}_s$ mixing on the lattice using NRQCD, which gives a leading contribution in the calculation of the width difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$ in the $1/m_b$ expansion. Using the next-to-leading formula of Beneke \textit{et al.}, we obtain $(\Delta\Gamma/\Gamma)_s$ = 0.151(37)(36)(17), where the the first error reflects the uncertainty of $f_{B_s}$ = 245(30) MeV, the second error comes from our calculation of the matrix element of $\Op_S$, and the third represents unknown $1/m_b$ correction.",hep,hep-lat,Addressing the LHC flavour anomalies with horizontal gauge symmetries,"We study the impact of an additional $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry with flavour-dependent charges for quarks and leptons on the LHC flavour anomalies observed in $B \to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$, $R(K) = B \to K \mu^+\mu^-/B \to K e^+e^-$, and $h \to \mu\tau$. In its minimal version with two scalar doublets, the resulting model naturally explains the deviations from the Standard Model observed in $B \to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$ and $R(K)$. The CMS access in $h \to \mu\tau$ can be explained by introducing a third scalar doublet, which gives rise to a prediction for $\tau \to 3\mu$. We investigate constraints from flavour observables and direct LHC searches for $pp \to Z' \to \mu^+\mu^-$. Our model successfully generates the measured fermion-mixing matrices and does not require vector-like fermions, unlike previous attempts to explain these anomalies.",hep,hep-ph,0

Out-of-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics in the Bloch sphere: temperature and internal entropy production,"An explicit expression for the temperature of an open two-level quantum system is obtained as a function of local properties, under the hypothesis of weak interaction with the environment. This temperature is defined for both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium states, and coincides with the environment temperature if the system reaches thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir. Additionally, we show that within this theoretical framework the total entropy production can be partitioned into two contributions: one due to heat transfer, and another, associated to internal irreversibilities, related to the loss of internal coherence by the qubit. The positiveness of the heat capacity is established, as well as its consistency with the well known results at thermal equilibrium. We apply these concepts to two different systems, and show that they behave in analogous ways as their classical counterparts.",physics,physics.atom-ph,Towards Pair Atomic Density Fitting for Correlation Energies with Benchmark Accuracy,"Pair atomic density fitting (PADF) is a promising strategy to reduce the scaling with system size of quantum chemical methods for the calculation of the correlation energy like the direct random phase approximation (RPA) or second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). PADF can however introduce large errors in correlation energies as the two-electron interaction energy is not guaranteed to be bounded from below. This issue can be partially alleviated by using very large fit sets, but this comes at the price of reduced efficiency and having to deal with near-linear dependencies in the fit set. In this work, we introduce an alternative methodology to overcome this problem that preserves the intrinsically favourable scaling of PADF. We first regularize the Fock matrix by projecting out parts of the basis set which gives rise to orbital products that are hard to describe by PADF. We then also apply this projector to the orbital coefficient matrix to improve the precision of PADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA. We systematically assess the accuracy of this new approach in a numerical atomic orbital framework using Slater Type Orbitals (STO) and correlation consistent Gaussian type basis sets up to quintuple-$\zeta$ quality for systems with more than 200 atoms. For the small and medium systems in the S66 database we show the maximum deviation of PADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA relative correlation energies to DF-MP2 and DF-RPA reference results to be 0.07 and 0.14 kcal/mol respectively. When the new projector method is used, the errors only slightly increase for large molecules and also when moderately sized fit sets are used the resulting errors are well under control. Finally, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of our algorithm by calculating the interaction energies of non-covalently bound complexes with more than 1000 atoms and 20000 atomic orbitals at the RPA@PBE/CC-pVTZ level of theory.",physics,physics.chem-ph,0
Surface in statistical ensembles,"The present contribution deals with surface terms appearing immediately in distributions and partition functions of statistical ensembles. It is shown that all ensembles under study, including ordinary canonical and grand canonical ensembles, involve surface terms. For a canonical ensemble both surface and volume terms correspond to a closed system. For a grand canonical ensemble the volume term corresponds to an open system, while the surface one - to a closed one. Finally, for the recently introduced open statistical ensemble the specific feature of which is the consideration of some surrounding region both volume and surface terms correspond to an open system. In conclusion, surface particles at solid/fluid boundary are interpreted as particles corresponding to number density oscillations near the surface; this completely agrees with the earlier introduced concept of surface tension at such a boundary.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Stepwise Bose-Einstein condensation in a spinor gas,"We observe multi-step condensation of sodium atoms with spin $F=1$, where the different Zeeman components $m_F=0,\pm 1$ condense sequentially as the temperature decreases. The precise sequence changes drastically depending on the magnetization $m_z$ and on the quadratic Zeeman energy $q$ (QZE) in an applied magnetic field. For large QZE, the overall structure of the phase diagram is the same as for an ideal spin 1 gas, although the precise locations of the phase boundaries are significantly shifted by interactions. For small QZE, antiferromagnetic interactions qualitatively change the phase diagram with respect to the ideal case, leading for instance to condensation in $m_F=\pm 1$, a phenomenon that cannot occur for an ideal gas with $q>0$.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,0

Efficient methods to determine resonances are thus in demand, in particular for Hamiltonian systems displaying a mix of chaotic and regular behavior.

Heat kernel for higher-order differential operators and generalized exponential functions,"We consider the heat kernel for higher-derivative and nonlocal operators in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space-time and its asymptotic behavior. As a building block for operators of such type, we consider the heat kernel of the minimal operator - generic power of the Laplacian - and show that it is given by the expression essentially different from the conventional exponential Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) ansatz. Rather it is represented by the generalized exponential function (GEF) directly related to what is known in mathematics as the Fox-Wright $\varPsi$-functions and Fox $H$-functions. The structure of its essential singularity in the proper time parameter is different from that of the usual exponential ansatz, which invalidated previous attempts to directly generalize the Schwinger-DeWitt heat kernel technique to higher-derivative operators. In particular, contrary to the conventional exponential decay of the heat kernel in space, we show the oscillatory behavior of GEF for higher-derivative operators. We give several integral representations for the generalized exponential function, find its asymptotics and semiclassical expansion, which turns out to be essentially different for local operators and nonlocal operators of noninteger order. Finally, we briefly discuss further applications of the GEF technique to generic higher-derivative and pseudodifferential operators in curved space-time, which might be critically important for applications of Horava-Lifshitz and other UV renormalizable quantum gravity models.",hep,hep-th,Mass-suppressed effects in heavy quark diffusion,"Many lattice studies of heavy quark diffusion originate from a colour-electric correlator, obtained as a leading term after an expansion in the inverse of the heavy-quark mass. In view of the fact that the charm quark is not particularly heavy, we consider subleading terms in the expansion. Working out correlators up to $O(1/M^2)$, we argue that the leading corrections are suppressed by $O(T/M)$, and one of them can be extracted from a colour-magnetic correlator. The corresponding transport coefficient is non-perturbative already at leading order in the weak-coupling expansion, and therefore requires a non-perturbative determination.",hep,hep-lat,0
Fully achromatic nulling interferometer (FANI) for high SNR exoplanet characterization,"Space-borne nulling interferometers have long been considered as the best option for searching and characterizing extra-solar planets located in the habitable zone of their parent stars. Solutions for achieving deep starlight extinction are now numerous and well demonstrated. However they essentially aim at realizing an achromatic central null in order to extinguish the star. In this communication is described a major improvement of the technique, where the achromatization process is extended to the entire fringe pattern. Therefore higher Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and appreciable simplification of the detection system should result. The basic principle of this Fully achromatic nulling interferometer (FANI) consists in inserting dispersive elements along the arms of the interferometer. Herein this principle is explained and illustrated by a preliminary optical system design.

Production of various elements in ultraperipheral $^{208}$Pb-$^{208}$Pb collisions at the LHC,"As predicted by theory and confirmed by measurements, one, two or three neutrons are emitted frequently in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of heavy relativistic nuclei, in particular, $^{208}$Pb. The exchange of low-energy Weizs\""{a}cker--Williams photons dominates in such interactions. This leads to the excitation and decay of Giant Dipole Resonances (GDR) in colliding nuclei below the proton emission threshold. Less is known about the electromagnetic dissociation of $^{208}$Pb induced by energetic photons leading to violent fragmentation of $^{208}$Pb. The UPCs of lead nuclei at the LHC were modelled with Relativistic ELectromagnetic Dissociation (RELDIS) model to evaluate the contribution of photonuclear reactions in the domain of quasideuteron absorption and at higher photon energies. It was demonstrated that due to the presence of a single heavy residue in the final state mostly accompanied by free protons and neutrons, the cross sections of the production of specific elements can be well approximated by the proton emission cross sections, which can be measured in the ALICE experiment at the LHC.",nucl,nucl-ex,Chemical and mechanical spinodals a unique liquid-gas instability,We demonstrate that the instabilities of asymmetric nuclear matter at sub-saturation densities do not present two types of instabilities as usually discussed but a unique one.

Lithospheric delamination beneath the southern Puna plateau resolved by local earthquake tomography,"We present a local earthquake tomography to illuminate the crustal and uppermost mantle structure beneath the southern Puna plateau and to test the delamination hypothesis. Vp and Vp/Vs ratios were obtained using travel time variations recorded by 75 temporary seismic stations between 2007 and 2009. In the upper crust, prominent low Vp anomalies are found beneath the main volcanic centers, indicating the presence of magma and melt beneath the southern Puna plateau. In the lowlands to the southeast of the Puna plateau, below the Sierras Pampeanas, a high Vp body is observed in the crust. Beneath the Moho at around 90 km depth, a strong high Vp anomaly is detected just west of the giant backarc Cerro Galan Ignimbrite caldera with the robustness of this feature being confirmed by multiple synthetic tests. This high velocity body can be interpreted as a delaminated block of lower crust and uppermost mantle lithosphere under the southern Puna plateau. The low velocities in the crust can be interpreted as having been induced by the delamination event that triggered the rise of fluids and melts into the crust and induced the high topography in this part of the plateau. The tomography also reveals low velocity anomalies that link arc magnetism at the Ojos del Salado volcanic center with slab seismicity clusters at depths of about 100 and 150 km and support fluid fluxing in the mantle wedge due to dehydration reaction within the subducted slab.",physics,physics.geo-ph,Gallium-nitride-based interference-filter-stabilized external cavity diode laser with a surface-activated-bonded output coupler,"We report on an interference-filter-stabilized external cavity diode laser using a gallium-nitride-based violet laser diode.

On the effectiveness of effective field theory in peripheral nucleon-nucleon scattering,"Peripheral nucleon-nucleon scattering is analysed in the framework of an effective field theory. Distorted-wave methods are used to remove the effects of one-pion exchange. Two-pion exchange and recoil corrections to one-pion exchange are then subtracted pertubatively. This removes all contributions up to order Q^3 in the chiral expansion. We have applied this to the 1D2, 1F3 and 1G4 waves, using phase shifts from various partial-wave analyses by the Nijmegen group. In regions where these analyses agree we find no evidence for a breakdown of the chiral expansion. One of the terms in the effective short-range potential, the leading one in the 1D2 channel, is larger might be expected, but in general these terms have momentum scales of about 300-400 MeV. We also see hints of isospin breaking in the pi-N couplings.",nucl,nucl-th,Di-jet measurements in heavy-ion collisions at STAR,"Jets are produced from hard scatterings in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. It is expected that these high-$p_T$ partons travel through the hot and dense medium before fragmenting. Therefore they are expected to suffer energy loss in the QGP via gluon radiation and elastic collisions along their path. Measurements of fully reconstructed jets help understand the effect of the energy loss on the jet structure and energy profile. A data-driven characterization of the background in Au+Au is needed in order to compare the results to p+p. The full azimuthal coverage of STAR Time Projection Chamber and Electromagnetic Calorimeter allows measurements of fully reconstructed di-jets, defined by jets that match the online trigger and recoil jets on the away side. A tight selection of the trigger jets allows for a selection of those coming from the surface. Hence, the population of jets on the recoil side is biased towards a maximal energy loss because of the extreme in-medium pathlength. We present measurements of di-jets, exploring their structure and properties in Au+Au and p+p at $\sqrt s_{NN}=$200 GeV in the STAR experiment.",nucl,nucl-ex,0

A Large-Diameter Hollow-Shaft Cryogenic Motor Based on a Superconducting Magnetic Bearing for Millimeter-Wave Polarimetry,"In this paper we present the design and measured performance of a novel cryogenic motor based on a superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB). The motor is tailored for use in millimeter-wave half-wave plate (HWP) polarimeters, where a HWP is rapidly rotated in front of a polarization analyzer or polarization-sensitive detector. This polarimetry technique is commonly used in cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization studies. The SMB we use is composed of fourteen yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) disks and a contiguous neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) ring magnet. The motor is a hollow-shaft motor because the HWP is ultimately installed in the rotor. The motor presented here has a 100 mm diameter rotor aperture. However, the design can be scaled up to rotor aperture diameters of approximately 500 mm. Our motor system is composed of four primary subsystems: (i) the rotor assembly, which includes the NdFeB ring magnet, (ii) the stator assembly, which includes the YBCO disks, (iii) an incremental encoder, and (iv) the drive electronics. While the YBCO is cooling through its superconducting transition, the rotor is held above the stator by a novel hold and release mechanism (HRM). The encoder subsystem consists of a custom-built encoder disk read out by two fiber optic readout sensors. For the demonstration described in this paper, we ran the motor at 50 K and tested rotation frequencies up to approximately 10 Hz. The feedback system was able to stabilize the the rotation speed to approximately 0.4%, and the measured rotor orientation angle uncertainty is less than 0.15 deg.

The orbit reveals a surpsingly high Quaoar-Weywot system mass of 1.6{\pm}0.3{\times}10^21 kg. Using the surface properties of the Uranian and Neptunian satellites as a proxy for Quaoar's surface, we reanalyze the size estimate from Brown and Trujillo (2004). We find, from a mean of available published size estimates, a diameter for Quaoar of 890 {\pm} 70 km.

To avoid the large-scale instability problem in interacting dark energy models, we employ the parameterized post-Friedmann (PPF) approach to do the calculation of perturbation evolution, for the $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ and $Q=\beta H\rho_{\Lambda}$ models. The current observational data sets used in this work include Planck (cosmic microwave background), BSH (baryon acoustic oscillations, type Ia supernovae, and Hubble constant), and LSS (redshift space distortions and weak lensing). According to the constraint results, we find that $\beta>0$ at more than $1\sigma$ level for the $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ model, which indicates that cold dark matter decays into vacuum energy; while $\beta=0$ is consistent with the current data at $1\sigma$ level for the $Q=\beta H\rho_{\Lambda}$ model. Taking the $\Lambda$CDM model as a baseline model, we find that a smaller upper limit, $\sum m_{\nu}<0.11$ eV ($2\sigma$), is induced by the latest BAO BOSS DR12 data and the Hubble constant measurement $H_{0} = 73.00 \pm 1.75$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. For the $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ model, we obtain $\sum m_{\nu}<0.20$ eV ($2\sigma$) from Planck+BSH. For the $Q=\beta H\rho_{\Lambda}$ model, $\sum m_{\nu}<0.10$ eV ($2\sigma$) and $\sum m_{\nu}<0.14$ eV ($2\sigma$) are derived from Planck+BSH and Planck+BSH+LSS, respectively.

In addition, the Made in Science project - European Research Week 2016/17 - has been the one of the largest project funded by the European Commission and it's often referred to as a model for organization and communication to the general public.

Energetic Particle Pressure at Interplanetary Shocks: STEREO-A Observations,"We study periods of elevated energetic particle intensities observed by STEREO-A when the partial pressure exerted by energetic ($\geq$83 keV) protons ($P_{EP}$) is larger than the pressure exerted by the interplanetary magnetic field ($P_{B}$). In the majority of cases, these periods are associated with the passage of interplanetary shocks. Periods when $P_{EP}$ exceeds $P_{B}$ by more than one order of magnitude are observed in the upstream region of fast interplanetary shocks where depressed magnetic field regions coincide with increases of the energetic particle intensities. When solar wind parameters are available, $P_{EP}$ also exceeds the pressure exerted by the solar wind thermal population ($P_{TH}$). Prolonged periods ($>$12 h) with both $P_{EP}$$>$$P_{B}$ and $P_{EP}$$>$$P_{TH}$ may also occur when energetic particles accelerated by an approaching shock encounter a region well-upstream of the shock characterized by low magnetic field magnitude and tenuous solar wind density. Quasi-exponential increases of the sum $P_{SUM}$=$P_{B}$+$P_{TH}$+$P_{EP}$ are observed in the immediate upstream region of the shocks regardless of individual changes in $P_{EP}$, $P_{B}$ and $P_{TH}$, indicating a coupling between $P_{EP}$ and the pressure of the background medium characterized by $P_{B}$ and $P_{TH}$. The quasi-exponential increase of $P_{SUM}$ implies a convected exponential radial gradient $\partial{P_{SUM}}/\partial{r}$$>$0 that results in an outward force applied to the plasma upstream of the shock. This force can be maintained by the mobile energetic particles streaming upstream of the shocks that, in the most intense events, drive electric currents able to generate diamagnetic cavities and depressed solar wind density regions.",physics,physics.space-ph,Kinetic fluctuations in the inhomogeneous plasma,"Using the Langevin approach and the multiscale technique, a kinetic theory of the time and space nonlocal fluctuations in the collisional plasma is constructed. In local equilibrium a generalized version of the Callen-Welton theorem is derived. It is shown that not only the dissipation but also the time and space derivatives of the dispersion determine the amplitude and the width of the spectrum lines of the electrostatic field fluctuations, as well as the form factor. There appear significant differences with respect to the non-uniform plasma. In the kinetic regime the form factor is more sensible to space gradient than the spectral function of the electrostatic field fluctuations. As a result of the inhomogeneity, these proprieties became asymmetric with respect to the inversion of the frequency sign. The differences in amplitude of peaks could become a new tool to diagnose slow time and space variations in the plasma.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,0
Band crossing in Shears band of $^{108}$Cd,"The level lifetimes have been measured for a Shears band of $^{108}$Cd which exhibits bandcrossing. The observed level energies and B(M1) rates have been successfully described by a semi-classical geometric model based on shear mechanism. In this geometric model, the bandcrossing in Shears band has been described as the reopening of the angle between the blades of a shear.",nucl,nucl-ex,Sensitivity of 8B breakup cross section to projectile structure in CDCC calculations,"Given the Astrophysical interest of $^7$Be$(p,\gamma)^8$B, there have been several experiments applying the Coulomb dissociation method for extracting the capture rate. Measurements at Michigan State are dominated by $E1$ contributions but have a small $E2$ component. On the other hand, a lower energy measurement at Notre Dame has a much stronger $E2$ contribution. The expectation was that the two measurements would tie down the $E2$ and thus allow for an accurate extraction of the $E1$ relevant for the capture process. The aim of this brief report is to show that the $E2$ factor in breakup reactions does not translate into a scaling of the $E2$ contribution in the corresponding capture reaction. We show that changes to the $^8$B single particle parameters, which are directly related to the $E2$ component in the capture reaction, do not effect the corresponding breakup reactions, using the present reaction theory.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Probing photo-ionization: Experiments on positive streamers in pure gasses and mixtures,"Positive streamers are thought to propagate by photo-ionization whose parameters depend on the nitrogen:oxygen ratio. Therefore we study streamers in nitrogen with 20%, 0.2% and 0.01% oxygen and in pure nitrogen, as well as in pure oxygen and argon. Our new experimental set-up guarantees contamination of the pure gases to be well below 1 ppm. Streamers in oxygen are difficult to measure as they emit considerably less light in the sensitivity range of our fast ICCD camera than the other gasses. Streamers in pure nitrogen and in all nitrogen/oxygen mixtures look generally similar, but become somewhat thinner and branch more with decreasing oxygen content. In pure nitrogen the streamers can branch so much that they resemble feathers. This feature is even more pronounced in pure argon, with approximately 10^2 hair tips/cm^3 in the feathers at 200 mbar; this density could be interpreted as the free electron density creating avalanches towards the streamer stem. It is remarkable that the streamer velocity is essentially the same for similar voltage and pressure in all nitrogen/oxygen mixtures as well as in pure nitrogen, while the oxygen concentration and therefore the photo-ionization lengths vary by more than five orders of magnitude. Streamers in argon have essentially the same velocity as well. The physical similarity of streamers at different pressures is confirmed in all gases; the minimal diameters are smaller than in earlier measurements.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,Structural mechanics of filamentous cyanobacteria,"Filamentous cyanobacteria, forming long strands of connected cells, are one of the earliest and most successful forms of life on Earth. They exhibit self-organised behaviour, forming large-scale patterns in structures like biomats and stromatolites. The mechanical properties of these rigid structures have contributed to their biological success and are important to applications like algae-based biofuel production. For active polymers like these cyanobacteria, one of the most important mechanical properties is the bending modulus, or flexural rigidity. Here, we quantify the bending stiffness of three species of filamentous cyanobacteria using a microfluidic flow device, where single filaments are deflected by fluid flow. This is complemented by measurements of the Young's modulus of the cell wall, via nanoindentation, and the cell wall thickness. We find that the stiffness of the cyanobacteria is well-captured by a simple model of a flexible rod, with most stress carried by a rigid outer wall. Finally, we connect these results to the curved shapes that these cyanobacteria naturally take while gliding, and quantify the forces generated internally to maintain this shape. The measurements can be used to model interactions between filamentous cyanobacteria, or with their environment, and how their collective behaviour emerges from such interactions.",physics,physics.bio-ph,0
Non-Equilibrium Dynamics and Superfluid Ring Excitations in Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates,"We revisit a classic study [D. S. Hall {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 81}, 1539 (1998)] of interpenetrating Bose-Einstein condensates in the hyperfine states $\ket{F = 1, m_f = -1}\equiv\ket{1}$ and $\ket{F = 2, m_f = +1}\equiv\ket{2}$ of ${}^{87}$Rb and observe striking new non-equilibrium component separation dynamics in the form of oscillating ring-like structures. The process of component separation is not significantly damped, a finding that also contrasts sharply with earlier experimental work, allowing a clean first look at a collective excitation of a binary superfluid. We further demonstrate extraordinary quantitative agreement between theoretical and experimental results using a multi-component mean-field model with key additional features: the inclusion of atomic losses and the careful characterization of trap potentials (at the level of a fraction of a percent).",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,Dynamical self-assembly of dipolar active Brownian particles in two dimensions,"Based on Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations, we study the dynamical self-assembly of active Brownian particles with dipole-dipole interactions, stemming from a permanent point dipole at the particle center. The propulsion direction of each particle is chosen to be parallel to its dipole moment. We explore a wide range of motilities and dipolar coupling strengths and characterize the corresponding behavior based on several order parameters. At low densities and low motilities, the most important structural phenomenon is the aggregation of the dipolar particles into chains. Upon increasing the particle motility, these chain-like structures break, and the system transforms into a weakly correlated isotropic fluid. At high densities, we observe that the motility-induced phase separation is strongly suppressed by the dipolar coupling. Once the dipolar coupling dominates the thermal energy, the phase separation disappears, and the system rather displays a flocking state, where particles form giant clusters and move collective along one direction. We provide arguments for the emergence of the flocking behavior, which is absent in the passive dipolar system.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,0
Testing MONDian Dark Matter with Galactic Rotation Curves,"MONDian dark matter (MDM) is a new form of dark matter quantum that naturally accounts for Milgrom's scaling, usually associated with modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), and theoretically behaves like cold dark matter (CDM) at cluster and cosmic scales. In this paper, we provide the first observational test of MDM by fitting rotation curves to a sample of 30 local spiral galaxies (z approximately 0.003). For comparison, we also fit the galactic rotation curves using MOND, and CDM. We find that all three models fit the data well. The rotation curves predicted by MDM and MOND are virtually indistinguishable over the range of observed radii (~1 to 30 kpc). The best-fit MDM and CDM density profiles are compared. We also compare with MDM the dark matter density profiles arising from MOND if Milgrom's formula is interpreted as Newtonian gravity with an extra source term instead of as a modification of inertia. We find that discrepancies between MDM and MOND will occur near the center of a typical spiral galaxy. In these regions, instead of continuing to rise sharply, the MDM mass density turns over and drops as we approach the center of the galaxy. Our results show that MDM, which restricts the nature of the dark matter quantum by accounting for Milgrom's scaling, accurately reproduces observed rotation curves.",hep,hep-ph,"Symmergent Gravity, Seesawic New Physics, and their Experimental Signatures","The standard model of elementary particles (SM) suffers from various problems, such as power-law ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity, exclusion of general relativity (GR), and absence of a dark matter candidate. The LHC experiments, according to which the TeV domain appears to be empty of new particles, started sidelining TeV-scale SUSY and other known cures of the UV sensitivity. In search for a remedy, in this work, it is revealed that affine curvature can emerge in a way restoring gauge symmetries explicitly broken by the UV cutoff. This emergent curvature cures the UV sensitivity and incorporates GR as symmetry-restoring emergent gravity ({\it symmergent gravity}, in brief) if a new physics sector (NP) exists to generate the Planck scale and if SM+NP is fermi-bose balanced. This setup, carrying fingerprints of trans-Planckian SUSY, predicts that gravity is Einstein (no higher-curvature terms), cosmic/gamma rays can originate from heavy NP scalars, and the UV cutoff might take right value to suppress the cosmological constant (alleviating fine-tuning with SUSY). The NP does not have to couple to the SM. In fact, NP-SM coupling can take any value from zero to $\Lambda^2_{SM}/\Lambda^2_{NP}$ if the SM is not to jump from $\Lambda_{SM}\approx 500\, {\rm GeV}$ to the NP scale $\Lambda_{NP}$. The zero coupling, certifying an undetectable NP, agrees with all the collider and dark matter bounds at present. The {\it seesawic} bound $\Lambda^2_{SM}/\Lambda^2_{NP}$, directly verifiable at colliders, implies that: {\it (i)} dark matter must have a mass $\lesssim \Lambda_{SM}$, {\it (ii)} Higgs-curvature coupling must be $\approx 1.3\%$, {\it (iii)} the SM RGEs must remain nearly as in the SM, and {\it (iv)} right-handed neutrinos must have a mass $\lesssim 1000\, {\rm TeV}$. These signatures serve as a concise testbed for symmergence.",hep,hep-th,0
Transverse-momentum and event-shape dependence of D-meson flow harmonics in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV,"The elliptic and triangular flow coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ of prompt D$^{0}$, D$^{+}$, and D$^{*+}$ mesons were measured at midrapidity ($|y|<0.8$) in Pb-Pb collisions at the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The D mesons were reconstructed via their hadronic decays in the transverse momentum interval $1< p_{\rm T}<36$ GeV/$c$ in central (0-10%) and semi-central (30-50%) collisions. Compared to pions, protons, and J/$\psi$ mesons, the average D-meson $v_{n}$ harmonics are compatible within uncertainties with a mass hierarchy for $p_{\rm T} \lesssim 3$ GeV/$c$, and are similar to those of charged pions for higher $p_{\rm T}$. The coupling of the charm quark to the light quarks in the underlying medium is further investigated with the application of the event-shape engineering (ESE) technique to the D-meson $v_2$ and $p_{\rm T}$-differential yields. The D-meson $v_2$ is correlated with average bulk elliptic flow in both central and semi-central collisions. Within the current precision, the ratios of per-event D-meson yields in the ESE-selected and unbiased samples are found to be compatible with unity. All the measurements are found to be reasonably well described by theoretical calculations including the effects of charm-quark transport and the recombination of charm quarks with light quarks in a hydrodynamically expanding medium.",nucl,nucl-ex,Skyrme Hartree-Fock Calculations for the Alpha Decay Q Values of Super-Heavy Nuclei,Hartree-Fock calculations with the SKX Skyrme interaction are carried out to obtain alpha-decay Q values for deformed nuclei above $^{208}$Pb assuming axial symmetry.

Expressing the conformal integral in terms of a Clifford algebra the linear system is related to toric GKZ systems. Explicit series solutions for conformal integrals are obtained using the power of toric methods as GKZ hypergeometric functions. Partial permutation symmetry of the solutions dictated by the toric method is used to relate the solutions to Feynman trees, or, channels, in field theory parlance.",hep,hep-th,0
An interpretable machine learning framework for dark matter halo formation,"We present a generalization of our recently proposed machine learning framework, aiming to provide new physical insights into dark matter halo formation. We investigate the impact of the initial density and tidal shear fields on the formation of haloes over the mass range $11.4 \leq \log(M/M_{\odot}) \leq 13.4$. The algorithm is trained on an N-body simulation to infer the final mass of the halo to which each dark matter particle will later belong. We then quantify the difference in the predictive accuracy between machine learning models using a metric based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We first train the algorithm with information about the density contrast in the particles' local environment. The addition of tidal shear information does not yield an improved halo collapse model over one based on density information alone; the difference in their predictive performance is consistent with the statistical uncertainty of the density-only based model. This implies that our machine learning setup does not identify any significant role for the tidal shear in determining halo masses. This result is confirmed as we verify the ability of the initial conditions-to-halo mass mapping learnt from one simulation to generalize to independent simulations. Our work illustrates the broader potential of developing interpretable machine learning frameworks to gain physical understanding of non-linear large-scale structure formation.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,"Molecular Cloud Evolution IV: Magnetic Fields, Ambipolar Diffusion, and the Star Formation Efficiency","We investigate the formation and evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) by the collision of convergent warm neutral medium (WNM) streams in the interstellar medium, in the presence of magnetic fields and ambipolar diffusion (AD), focusing on the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency (SFE), as well as of the mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio (M2FR) in the forming clouds. We find that: 1) Clouds formed by supercritical inflow streams proceed directly to collapse, while clouds formed by subcritical streams first contract and then re-expand, oscillating on the scale of tens of Myr. 2) Our suite of simulations with initial magnetic field strength of 2, 3, and 4 $\mu\G$ show that only supercritical or marginal critical streams lead to reasonable star forming rates. 3) The GMC's M2FR is a generally increasing function of time, whose growth rate depends on the details of how mass is added to the GMC from the WNM. 4) The M2FR is a highly fluctuating function of position in the clouds. 5) In our simulations, the SFE approaches stationarity, because mass is added to the GMC at a similar rate at which it converts mass to stars. In such an approximately stationary regime, the SFE provides a proxy of the supercritical mass fraction in the cloud. 6) We observe the occurrence of buoyancy of the low-M2FR regions within the gravitationally-contracting GMCs, so that the latter naturally segregate into a high-density, high-M2FR ""core"" and a low-density, low-M2FR ""envelope"", without the intervention of AD.

Generalized negative flows in hierarchies of integrable evolution equations,"A one-parameter generalization of the hierarchy of negative flows is introduced for integrable hierarchies of evolution equations, which yields a wider (new) class of non-evolutionary integrable nonlinear wave equations. As main results, several integrability properties of these generalized negative flow equation are established, including their symmetry structure, conservation laws, and bi-Hamiltonian formulation. (The results also apply to the hierarchy of ordinary negative flows).

We show that the velocity of front propagation can be controlled up to a certain coupling strength beyond which spatially periodic patterns, such as Turing patterns or coexistence of spatially homogeneous solutions and Turing patterns, may be induced. This behaviour is investigated through a linear stability analysis of the spatially homogeneous steady states and numerical investigations of the full nonlinear equations in dependence upon the nonlocal coupling strength and the ratio of the excitatory and inhibitory coupling ranges.",nlin,nlin.PS,0
In-medium Properties of Hadrons -- Observables,"We first briefly review the theoretical basis for calculations of changes of hadronic properties in dense nuclear matter. These changes have usually been investigated by means of relativistic heavy-ion reactions. Here we discuss that observable consequences of such changes can also be seen in more elementary reactions on nuclei. Particular emphasis is put on a discussion of actual observables in photonuclear reactions; we discuss in detail $\eta$- and vector-meson production. We show that photoproduction of $\eta$'s can yield essential information on in-medium properties of the $S_{11}(1535)$ resonance while the $\phi$ meson properties will probably not be accessible through the $K^+K^-$ decay channel. However, for $\omega$ mesons the $\pi^0\gamma$ decay channel, due to its reduced final state interaction, looks more promising in this respect. Completely free of final state interactions is dilepton production in the few GeV range. We show that the sensitivity of this decay channel to changes of hadronic properties in medium in photonuclear reactions on nuclei is as large as in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Finally we discuss that hadron production in nuclei at 10 -- 20 GeV photon energies can give important information on the hadronization process.",nucl,nucl-ex,Bayesian calibration of viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic (VAH) simulations of heavy-ion collisions,"A Bayesian calibration, using experimental data from 2.76 $A$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, of a novel hybrid model is presented in which the usual pre-hydrodynamic and viscous relativistic fluid dynamic (vRFD) stages are replaced by a viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic (VAH) core that smoothly interpolates between the initial expansion-dominated, approximately boost-invariant longitudinally free-streaming and the subsequent collision-dominated (3+1)-dimensional standard vRFD stages. This model yields meaningful constraints for the temperature-dependent specific shear and bulk viscosities, $(\eta/s)(T)$ and $(\zeta/s)(T)$, for temperatures up to about $700$ MeV (i.e. over twice the range that could be explored with earlier models). With its best-fit model parameters the calibrated VAH model makes highly successful predictions for additional $p_T$-dependent observables for which high-quality experimental data are available that were not used for the model calibration.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Multilayer shallow-water model with stratification and shear,"The purpose of this paper is to present a shallow-water-type model with multiple inhomogeneous layers featuring variable linear velocity vertical shear and startificaion in horizontal space and time. This is achieved by writing the layer velocity and buoyancy fields as linear functions of depth, with coefficients that depend arbitrarily on horizontal position and time. The model is a generalization of Ripa's (1995) single-layer model to an arbitrary number of layers. Unlike models with homogeneous layers the present model is able to represent thermodynamics processes driven by heat and freshwater fluxes through the surface or mixing processes resulting from fluid exchanges across contiguous layers. A model configuration with only one layer has been previously shown to provide: a very good representation of the exact vertical normal modes up to the first internal mode; an exact representation of long-perturbation (free boundary) baroclinic instability; and a very reasonable representation of short-perturbation (classical Eady) baroclinic instability. Here it is shown that substantially more accurate overall results with respect to single-layer calculations can be achieved by considering a stack of only a few layers. A similar behavior is found in ageostrophic (classical Stone) baroclinic instability by describing accurately the dependence of the solutions on the Richardson number with only two layers.",physics,physics.ao-ph,Was Zidane honest or well-informed?

"Ultrafast Laser Ablation, Intrinsic Threshold, and Nanopatterning of Monolayer Molybdenum Disulfide","Laser direct writing is an attractive method for patterning 2D materials without contamination. Literature shows that the femtosecond ablation threshold of graphene across substrates varies by an order of magnitude. Some attribute it to the thermal coupling to the substrates, but it remains by and large an open question. For the first time the effect of substrates on femtosecond ablation of 2D materials is studied using MoS$_{2}$ as an example. We show unambiguously that femtosecond ablation of MoS$_{2}$ is an adiabatic process with negligible heat transfer to the substrates. The observed threshold variation is due to the etalon effect which was not identified before for the laser ablation of 2D materials. Subsequently, an intrinsic ablation threshold is proposed as a true threshold parameter for 2D materials. Additionally, we demonstrate for the first time femtosecond laser patterning of monolayer MoS$_{2}$ with sub-micron resolution and mm/s speed. Moreover, engineered substrates are shown to enhance the ablation efficiency, enabling patterning with low-power femtosecond oscillators. Finally, a zero-thickness approximation is introduced to predict the field enhancement with simple analytical expressions.

Dense seismic networks and improved phase picking methods produce massive earthquake phase data sets, particularly for earthquake swarms and aftershocks occurring closely in time and space, making phase association a challenging problem. We present a new association method, the Gaussian Mixture Model Association (GaMMA), that combines the Gaussian mixture model for phase measurements (both time and amplitude), with earthquake location, origin time, and magnitude estimation. We treat earthquake phase association as an unsupervised clustering problem in a probabilistic framework, where each earthquake corresponds to a cluster of P and S phases with hyperbolic moveout of arrival times and a decay of amplitude with distance. We use a multivariate Gaussian distribution to model the collection of phase picks for an event, the mean of which is given by the predicted arrival time and amplitude from the causative event. We carry out the pick assignment for each earthquake and determine earthquake parameters (i.e., earthquake location, origin time, and magnitude) under the maximum likelihood criterion using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The GaMMA method does not require the typical association steps of other algorithms, such as grid-search or supervised training. The results on both synthetic test and the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence show that GaMMA effectively associates phases from a temporally and spatially dense earthquake sequence while producing useful estimates of earthquake location and magnitude.",physics,physics.geo-ph,0

Additionally, we choose a variant of the Ulam method to numerically approximate the Perron-Frobenius operator for the map, allowing us to calculate the anomalous diffusion exponent via an eigenvalue problem, compared to the solution of the Fractional Diffusion Equation.

On Frequency-Dependent Rock Experiments: A Comparative Review,"Rock properties are environment- and condition-dependent which render field-laboratory comparisons ambiguous for a number of known and unknown reasons that constitute the upscaling problem. Unknowns are first transformed into knowns in a controlled environment (laboratory) and second in a volatile environment (field). Causality-bound dispersion and attenuation are respectively defined as rock properties that are frequency- and distance-dependent: dispersion implies non-zero attenuation and vice versa. Forced-Oscillation (FO), Resonant-Bar (RB), and Pulse-Transmission (PT). are the customary techniques to measure rock properties at Hz, kHz, and MHz frequencies. Notably FO has emerged as the current champion in bridging the field-laboratory void in recent years. Not only is FO probing seismic (Hz) frequencies but with $\sim10^{-6}$ strain amplitudes it is also similar to field seismic. RB and PT are concisely however FO is verbosely elaborated by chronologically compiling most (if not all) FO studies on sedimentary rocks and comparing all available FO measurements on reference materials such as lucite, aluminium, and PEEK. First of its kind, this inter-laboratory comparison may serve as a reference for others who seek to verify their own results. Differences between FO are discussed with alternative strain and stress sensors being the focal points. Other techniques such as Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS), Laser UltraSonics (LUS), and Differential Acoustic Resonance Spectroscopy (DARS) that are similar to FO, RB, and PT are also described. Only time will tell what the future holds for FO but plausible improvements for the future are ultimately given which may elevate it even further.

Effects of Nonlocal One-Pion-Exchange Potential in Deuteron,"The off-shell aspects of the one-pion-exchange potential (OPEP) are discussed. Relativistic Hamiltonians containing relativistic kinetic energy, relativistic OPEP with various off-shell behaviors and Argonne $v_{18}$ short-range parameterization are used to study the deuteron properties.

We study potentials having $\mu$=-1, 0 and +1 and we find that they are nearly unitarily equivalent.

Evidence of Three Mechanisms Explaining the Radius Anomaly of Hot Jupiters,"The radii of hot Jupiters are still not fully understood and all of the proposed explanations are based on the idea that these close-in giant planets possess hot interiors. We approach the radius anomaly problem by adopting a statistical approach. We infer the internal luminosity for the sample of hot Jupiters, study its effect on the interior structure, and put constraints on which mechanism is the dominant one. We develop a flexible and robust hierarchical Bayesian model that couples the interior structure of exoplanets to their observed properties. We apply the model to 314 hot Jupiters and infer the internal luminosity distribution for each planet and study at the population level ({\it i}) the mass-luminosity-radius distribution and as a function of equilibrium temperature the distributions of the ({\it ii}) heating efficiency, ({\it iii}) internal temperature, and the ({\it iv}) pressure of the radiative-convective-boundary (RCB). We find that hot Jupiters tend to have high internal luminosity leading to hot interiors. This has important consequences on the cooling rate and we find that the RCB is located at low pressures. Assuming that the ultimate source of the extra heating is the irradiation from the host star, we illustrate that the heating efficiency follows a Gaussian distribution, in agreement with previous results. We discuss our findings in the context of the proposed heating mechanisms and illustrate that ohmic dissipation, advection of potential temperature, and thermal tides are in agreement with certain trends inferred from our analysis and thus all three models can explain aspects of the observations. We provide new insights on the interior structure of hot Jupiters and show that with our current knowledge it is still challenging to firmly identify the universal mechanism driving the inflated radii.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,MEPSA: a flexible peak search algorithm designed for uniformly spaced time series,"We present a novel algorithm aimed at identifying peaks within a uniformly sampled time series affected by uncorrelated Gaussian noise. The algorithm, called ""MEPSA"" (multiple excess peak search algorithm), essentially scans the time series at different timescales by comparing a given peak candidate with a variable number of adjacent bins. While this has originally been conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst light (GRB) curves, its usage can be readily extended to other astrophysical transient phenomena, whose activity is recorded through different surveys. We tested and validated it through simulated featureless profiles as well as simulated GRB time profiles. We showcase the algorithm's potential by comparing with the popular algorithm by Li and Fenimore, that is frequently adopted in the literature. Thanks to its high flexibility, the mask of excess patterns used by MEPSA can be tailored and optimised to the kind of data to be analysed without modifying the code. The C code is made publicly available.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,0
Cold dilute nuclear matter with $\alpha$-particle condensation in a generalized nonlinear relativistic mean-field model,"We explore the thermodynamic properties of homogeneous cold (zero-temperature) nuclear matter including nucleons and $\alpha$-particle condensation at low densities by using a generalized nonlinear relativistic mean-field (gNL-RMF) model. In the gNL-RMF model, the $\alpha$-particle is included as explicit degree of freedom and treated as point-like particle with its interaction described by meson exchanges and the in-medium effects on the $\alpha$ binding energy is described by density- and temperature-dependent energy shift with the parameters obtained by fitting the experimental Mott density. We find that below the dropping density $n_{\rm{drop}}$ ($\sim 3\times 10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$), the zero-temperature symmetric nuclear matter is in the state of pure Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of $\alpha$ particles while the neutron-rich nuclear matter is composed of $\alpha$-BEC and neutrons. Above the $n_{\rm{drop}}$, the fraction of $\alpha$-BEC decreases with density and vanishes at the transition density $n_t$ ($\sim 8\times 10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$). Above the $n_t$, the nuclear matter becomes pure nucleonic matter. Our results indicate that the empirical parabolic law for the isospin asymmetry dependence of nuclear matter equation of state is heavily violated by the $\alpha$-particle condensation in the zero-temperature dilute nuclear matter, making the conventional definition of the symmetry energy meaningless. We investigate the symmetry energy defined under parabolic approximation for the zero-temperature dilute nuclear matter with $\alpha$-particle condensation, and find it is significantly enhanced compared to the case without clusters and becomes saturated at about $7$ MeV at very low densities ($\lesssim 10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$). The critical temperature for $\alpha$-condensation in homogeneous dilute nuclear matter is also discussed.",nucl,nucl-ex,Challenges in description of heavy-ion collisions with microscopic time-dependent approaches,"Important efforts have been dedicated in the past few years to describe near-barrier heavy-ion collisions with microscopic quantum theories like the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach and some of its extensions.

Our study reveals that, surprisingly, the number of bundles is independent of the number of flagella, and the formation of three bundles is always the most frequent case. We assume that this relates to the fact that different mutants have the same body length. There is no significant difference between the bundle width and length for distinct strains, but the projected angle between the bundles increases with the flagellar number. Furthermore, we find that the swimming speed is anti-correlated with the projected angle between the bundles, and the wobbling angle between the swimming direction and cell body increases with the number of flagella. Our findings highlight the impact of geometrical properties of bacteria such as body length and bundle configuration on their motility.",physics,physics.bio-ph,0
Approaching the precursor nuclei of the third r-process peak with RIBs,"The rapid neutron nucleosynthesis process involves an enormous amount of very exotic neutron-rich nuclei, which represent a theoretical and experimental challenge. Two of the main decay properties that affect the final abundance distribution the most are half-lives and neutron branching ratios. Using fragmentation of a primary $^{238}$U beam at GSI we were able to measure such properties for several neutron-rich nuclei from $^{208}$Hg to $^{218}$Pb. This contribution provides a short update on the status of the data analysis of this experiment, together with a compilation of the latest results published in this mass region, both experimental and theoretical. The impact of the uncertainties connected with the beta-decay rates and with beta-delayed neutron emission is illustrated on the basis of $r$-process network calculations. In order to obtain a reasonable reproduction of the third $r$-process peak, it is expected that both half-lives and neutron branching ratios are substantially smaller, than those based on FRDM+QRPA, commonly used in $r$-process model calculations. Further measurements around $N\sim126$ are required for a reliable modelling of the underlying nuclear structure, and for performing more realistic $r$-process abundance calculations.",nucl,nucl-ex,Factorial cumulants from short-range correlations and global baryon number conservation,"We calculate the baryon factorial cumulants assuming arbitrary short-range correlations and the global baryon number conservation.

We observe that for $n$-th factorial cumulant, the short-range correlations of more than $n$ particles are suppressed with the increasing number of particles.

The proposed SEP sensor is based on the Kretschmann-Raether configuration of conventional surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor, where the metal thin film was replaced by the J-aggregate cyanine dye film. The excitation of SEP results in a strong electric field at the interface of TDBC and analyte, and exponentially decaying into the analyte, which is sensitive to the refractive index variations of analyte. The sensitivity of 118.1818 $^\circ/\text{RIU}$ (140.4286 $^\circ/\text{RIU}$) was achieved for the proposed SEP sensor within the refractive index range 1.0-1.001 (1.33-1.36) of gaseous analyte (aqueous solutions), which is about 2 (3.5) times higher than that of conventional gold-based SPR sensor.

In the most simple description of a soccer match one assumes that scoring goals can be described by a constant goal rate for each team, implying simple Poissonian and Markovian behavior. Here a general framework for the identification of deviations from this behavior is presented. For this endeavor it is essential to formulate an a priori estimate of the expected number of goals per team in a specific match. The analysis scheme is applied to approximately 40 seasons of the German Bundesliga. It is possible to characterize the impact of the previous course of the match on the present match behavior. This allows one to identify interesting generic features about soccer matches and thus to learn about the hidden complexities behind scoring goals.",physics,physics.data-an,0
Tagging new physics with charm,"We propose a new variable, the charm fraction, for collider searches for new physics. We analyze this variable in the context of searches for simplified supersymmetry models with squarks, the gluino, and the bino, assuming that only the lightest mass-degenerate squarks can be produced at the high-luminosity LHC. The charm fraction complements event counting and kinematic information, increasing the sensitivity of the searches for models with heavy gluinos, for which squark production is flavor-blind. If squarks are discovered at the LHC, this variable can help discriminate between different underlying models. In particular, with improved charm tagging, the charm fraction can provide information on the gluino mass, and in some scenarios, on whether this mass is within the reach of a future 100 TeV hadron collider.",hep,hep-ex,Induced Chern-Simons modified gravity at finite temperature,"We calculate the linearized four-dimensional gravitational Chern-Simons term at the finite temperature, show its finiteness and explicitly demonstrate that its transversal part matches the known result for the chiral vortical conductivity.",hep,hep-th,0
Analysis of thermally stimulated luminescence and conductivity without quasiequilibrium approximation,"Thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) and conductivity (TSC) are considered using the classical insulator model that assumes one kind of the active trap, one kind of inactive deep trap, and one kind of the recombination center. Kinetic equations describing the model are solved numerically without and with the use of the quasiequilibrium (QE) approximation. The QE state parameter qI,, the relative recombination probability g, and a new parameter called quasi-stationary (QS) state parameter q*=qIg are used for the analysis of the TSL and TSC. The TSL and TSC curves and the temperature dependences of qI, q*, g, the recombination lifetime, and the occupancies of active traps and recombination centers are numerically calculated for five sets of kinetic parameters and different heating rates. These calculation results show that: (1) the upper limit of the heating rate for presence of the QS state appears at higher heating rate than that for the QE state when the retrapping process is present, and (2) the TSL (TSC) curves in the QS state have the properties similar to those for the TSL (TSC) curves in the QE state. Approximate formulas for calculation of the parameters qI and q* in the initial range of the TSL and TSC curves are derived and used in the heating-rate methods, proposed in this work, for determination of those parameters from the calculated TSL curves.",nlin,nlin.SI,Effect of gravitational field on collective motion of fish,"Fish exhibit various patterns of collective motion, in which individual fish sense the gravitational field and tend to move horizonally. We study the effect of gravity on the collective patterns by incorporating suppression of vertical motion in an agent-based model. The gravitational factor induces a tornado which is a vertically and highly elongated form of a torus, The vortex axis becomes almost identical to the vertical axis even when the gravitational factor is weak compared to the interaction between fish. We also obtained a vertically elongated polarized school with high frontal density. Our results clarify the effect of gravity on the shape of clusters, individual-level motion, and mobility of the entire cluster.",nlin,nlin.AO,0
Tunneling into fuzzball states,"String theory suggests that black hole microstates are quantum, horizon sized `fuzzballs', rather than smooth geometries with horizon. Radiation from fuzzballs can carry information and does not lead to information loss. But if we let a shell of matter collapse then it creates a horizon, and it seems that subsequent radiation will lead to information loss. We argue that the resolution to this problem is that the shell can tunnel to the fuzzball configurations. The amplitude for tunneling is small because we are relating two macroscopically different configurations, but the number of states that we can tunnel to, given through the Bekenstein entropy, is very large. These small and large numbers can cancel each other, making it possible for the shell to tunnel into fuzzball states before a significant amount of radiation has been emitted. This offers a way to resolve the information paradox.",hep,hep-th,The chicken or the egg; or Who ordered the chiral phase transition?,"We draw an analogy between the deconfining transition in the 2+1 dimensional Georgi-Glashow model and the chiral phase transition in 3+1 dimensional QCD. Based on the detailed analysis of the former (hep-th/0010201) we suggest that the chiral symmetry restoration in QCD at high temperature is driven by the thermal ensemble of baryons and anti-baryons. The chiral symmetry is restored when roughly half of the volume is occupied by the baryons. Surprisingly enough, even though baryons are rather heavy, a crude estimate for the critical temperature gives $T_c=180$ Mev. In this scenario the binding of the instantons is not the cause but rather a consequence of the chiral symmetry restoration.",hep,hep-lat,0
Longitudinal Asymmetry and its Measurable Effects in Pb-Pb Collisions at 2.76 TeV,"Collisions of identical nuclei at finite impact parameter have an unequal number of participating nucleons from each nucleus due to fluctuations.

Dilute systems formed in central collisions are shown to fluctuate between two energetically favourable mechanisms: reverting to a compact shape or rather disintegrating into several fragments. The latter result can be connected to the recent observation of bimodal distributions for quantities characterising fragmentation processes and may suggest new investigations.",nucl,nucl-th,0
XMM Observations of the Seyfert 2 Galaxy NGC 7590: the Nature of X-ray Absorption,"We present the analysis of three XMM observations of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7590. The source was found to have no X-ray absorption in the low spatial resolution ASCA data. The XMM observations provide a factor of 10 better spatial resolution than previous ASCA data. We find that the X-ray emission of NGC 7590 is dominated by an off-nuclear ULX and extended emission from the host galaxy. The nuclear X-ray emission is rather weak comparing with the host galaxy. Based on its very low X-ray luminosity as well as the small ratio between the 2-10 keV and the [O III] fluxes, we interpret NGC 7590 as Compton-thick rather than being an ""unobscured"" Seyfert 2 galaxy. Future higher resolution observations such as Chandra are crucial to shed light on the nature of NGC 7590 nucleus.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,ROME III. The Arecibo Search for Auroral Emissions and Star-Planet Interactions at 5 GHz,"After nearly three decades of discovery, many exoplanetary systems have been studied and characterized in detail with one important exception: exoplanet magnetism. Although many surveys sought to detect magnetospheric radio emissions from exoplanets to directly measure their magnetic field strengths, they have yet to reveal an unambiguous detection. However, the indirect detection of exoplanet magnetic fields by measuring their influence on their host stars via magnetic star-planet interactions has recently gained prominence as an alternative method of discovery. This third paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted radio survey of eight nearby exoplanet-hosting systems that may engage in star-planet interactions. This survey, conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at $\sim$5 GHz, has the greatest frequency coverage of any to date, while providing mJy-level sensitivity over $<$1 s integration times. No exoplanet-induced stellar radio bursts were detected.

Morphology and mechanical properties of nanocrystalline Cu/Ag alloy,"Hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to study the microstructures of nanocrystalline (nc) Cu/Ag alloys with various Ag concentrations. When the Ag concentration is below 50 Ag atoms/nm!, an increase in Ag concentration leads to a gradual growth of monolayer grain boundary (GB) complexions into nanolayer complexions. Above the concentration of 50 Ag atoms/nm!, wetting layers with a bulk crystalline phase are observed. The effects of Ag on mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of nc Cu/Ag alloys are investigated in MD simulations of uniaxial tension. GB sliding resistance is found to first increase and then decrease with an increase in Ag concentration. Surprisingly, we also find that the dislocation density decreases monotonically with an increase in Ag concentration, which suggests that the grain interiors are softened by the introduction of Ag dopants at GBs. In addition, there is a critical Ag concentration that maximizes flow stress of nc Cu/Ag alloys. The flow stress, GB sliding resistance, and the intragranular dislocation densities become less sensitive to Ag dopants when the grain diameter increases from 5nm to 40nm.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Resonant metallic states in driven quasiperiodic lattices,"We consider a quasiperiodic Aubry-Andre (AA) model and add a weak time-periodic and spatially quasiperiodic perturbation.

For a spatial resonance which reduces the reciprocal space dynamics to an effective one-dimensional two-leg ladder case, the ac perturbation resonantly couples certain groups of localized eigenstates of the undriven AA model and turns them into extended metallic ones. Slight detuning of the spatial and temporal frequencies off resonance returns these states into localized ones. We analyze the details of the resonant metallic eigenstates using Floquet representations. In particular, we find that their size grows linearly with the system size. Initial wave packets overlap with resonant metallic eigenstates and lead to ballistic spreading.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,0

Phase-space distributions of nuclear short-range correlations,"Nuclear short-range correlations (SRCs) induce high-momentum/high-energy fluctuations in the nuclear medium. In order to assess their impact on nuclear bulk properties, like nuclear radii and kinetic energies, it is instrumental to determine how SRCs are distributed in phase space as this sheds light on the connection between their appearance in coordinate and momentum space. Using the lowest-order correlation operator approximation (LCA) to include SRC, we compute two-dimensional nuclear Wigner quasiprobability distributions $w(r, k)$ to locate those $({r}, {k})$ phase-space regions that are most heavily impacted by SRCs. The SRC-induced high-momentum components find their origin in a radial range that is confined to the nuclear interior. Significant SRCs strength is generated in the full momentum range $0 \leq k \lesssim 5 ~\text{fm}^{-1} $ covered in this work, but below the Fermi momentum those are dwarfed by the mean-field contributions. As an application of $w(r, k)$, we focus on the radial dependence of the kinetic energy $T$ and the momentum dependence of the radius $r_{\text{rms}}$ for the symmetric nuclei $^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca and the asymmetric nucleus $^{48}$Ca. The kinetic energy almost doubles after including SRCs, with the largest increase occurring in the nuclear interior $r \lesssim 2$ fm. The momentum dependence of the $r_{\text{rms}}$ teaches that the largest contributions stem from $k \lesssim 2 $ fm$^{-1}$, where the SRCs induce a slight reduction of the order of a few percent. The SRCs systematically reduce the $^{48}$Ca neutron skin by an amount that can be 10\%.",nucl,nucl-th,"Study of Azimuthal Correlations in the Target Fragmentation Region in p, d, He, C+C, Ta and C+Ne, Cu Collisions at a Momentum of 4.2, 4.5 and 10 AGeV/c","Azimuthal correlations between the same type of particles (protons or pions) in the target fragmentation region was studied in d, He, C + C, Ta (4.2 AGeV/c), C + Ne, Cu (4.5AGeV/c) and p + C, Ta (10 GeV/c) interactions. The data were obtained from the SKM-200-GIBS streamer chamber and from Propane Bubble Chamber (PBL-500) systems utilized at JINR. Study of multiparticle azimuthal correlations offers unique information about space-time evolution of the interactions. Azimuthal correlations were investigated by using correlation function C($\Delta\phi$)=dN/d($\Delta\phi$), where $\Delta\phi$ represents the angle between the sums of transverse momenta vectors for particles emitted in the forward and backward hemispheres. For protons a ""back-to back"" (""negative"") azimuthal correlations were observed in the above mentioned interactions. The absolute values of the correlation coefficient $|\xi|$ -- the slope parameter of C($\Delta\phi$), strongly depend on the mass number of the target ($A_T$) nuclei in the nucleon-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions. Namely, $|\xi|$ -- decreases with increase of $A_T$ in p+C and p+Ta collisions, while $|\xi|$ decreases from d+C up to C+Ne and then almost does not change with increase of $A_P$, $A_T$ in (d+He)Ta, C+Cu and C+Ta collisions.

Weak-Lensing Mass Calibration of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Equatorial Sunyaev-Zeldovich Cluster Sample with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey,"Mass calibration uncertainty is the largest systematic effect for using clusters of galaxies to constrain cosmological parameters.

To date, the totality of exoplanetary observations in the mid- and far-infrared, at wavelengths $>$3 $\mu$m, have been taken with Spitzer. In some cases, in the past years, repeated observations and multiple reanalyses of the same datasets led to discrepant results, raising questions about the accuracy and reproducibility of such measurements. Morello et al. 2014, 2015 proposed a blind-source separation method based on the Independent Component Analysis of pixel time series (pixel-ICA) to analyze IRAC data, obtaining coherent results when applied to repeated transit observations previously debated in the literature. Here we introduce a variant to pixel-ICA through the use of wavelet transform, wavelet pixel-ICA, which extends its applicability to low-S/N cases. We describe the method and discuss the results obtained over twelve eclipses of the exoplanet XO3b observed during the ""Warm Spitzer"" era in the 4.5 $\mu$m band.

Electromagnetic fields in ultra-peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions (UPC) provide unique opportunities to study processes under strong electromagnetic fields. Highly-charged moving ions carry strong electromagnetic fields that act as fields of photons. The exchange of photons could induce photonuclear and two-photon interactions as well as excite the ions into giant dipole resonances (GDRs) or even higher excitation. The GDRs typically decay by emitting photons and even a single neutron, while high-excited resonances usually decay by emitting two or more photons and/or neutrons. On the other hand, the electromagnetic fields of heavy ions are very strong, so one of the two colliding ions is enforced by the other's electromagnetic field. As a result, the two colliding ions are pushed into opposite directions by the electromagnetic forces, and thus the neutrons emitted from different ions could present a back-to-back correlation. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation implementing the electromagnetic fields as well as the neutron emission from previous measurements or model calculations, we qualitatively demonstrate that the above electromagnetic effect is large enough to be observed in UPC, which would provide a clear means to study the strong electromagnetic fields and its effects.",nucl,nucl-ex,Nodal Lines in the Cranked HFB Overlap kernels,"Norm overlap kernels of the cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states are studied in the context of angular momentum projection.

Adaptive Test Allocation for Outbreak Detection and Tracking in Social Contact Networks,"We present a general framework for adaptive allocation of viral tests in social contact networks. We pose and solve several complementary problems. First, we consider the design of a social sensing system whose objective is the early detection of a novel epidemic outbreak. In particular, we propose an algorithm to select a subset of individuals to be tested in order to detect the onset of an epidemic outbreak as fast as possible. We pose this problem as a hitting time probability maximization problem and use submodularity optimization techniques to derive explicit quality guarantees for the proposed solution. Second, once an epidemic outbreak has been detected, we consider the problem of adaptively distributing viral tests over time in order to maximize the information gained about the current state of the epidemic. We formalize this problem in terms of information entropy and mutual information and propose an adaptive allocation strategy with quality guarantees. For these problems, we derive analytical solutions for any stochastic compartmental epidemic model with Markovian dynamics, as well as efficient Monte-Carlo-based algorithms for non-Markovian dynamics.

Critical points of the cosmic velocity field and the uncertainties in the value of the Hubble constant,"The existence of critical points for the peculiar velocity field is a natural feature of the correlated vector field. These points appear at the junctions of velocity domains with different orientations of their averaged velocity vectors. Since peculiar velocities are the important cause of the scatter in the Hubble expansion rate, we propose that a more precise determination of the Hubble constant can be made by restricting analysis to a subsample of observational data containing only the zones around the critical points of the peculiar velocity field, associated with voids and saddle points. On large-scales the critical points, where the first derivative of the gravitational potential vanishes, can easily be identified using the density field and classified by the behavior of the Hessian of the gravitational potential. We use high-resolution N-body simulations to show that these regions are stable in time and hence are excellent tracers of the initial conditions. Furthermore, we show that the variance of the Hubble flow can be substantially minimized by restricting observations to the subsample of such regions of vanishing velocity instead of aiming at increasing the statistics by averaging indiscriminately using the full data sets, as is the common approach.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,The Structure and Kinematics of the Circum-Galactic Medium from Far-UV Spectra of z~2-3 Galaxies,"We present new results on the kinematics and spatial distribution of metal-enriched gas within 125 kpc (physical) of Lyman Break galaxies at redshifts z~2-3. In particular, we demonstrate how rest-UV galaxy spectra can be used to obtain key spatial and spectral information more efficiently than possible with QSO sightlines. After recalibrating the measurement of galaxy systemic redshifts from their UV spectra, we investigate the kinematics of galaxy-scale outflows via the strong interstellar (IS) absorption and Lya emission lines (when present), as well as their dependence on other physical properties of the galaxies. We construct a sample of 512 close (1-15 arcsec) angular pairs of z~2-3 LBGs in which the spectra background galaxies probe the circumgalactic gas surrrounding those in the foreground. The close pairs, together with spectra of the foreground galaxies themselves, sample galactocentric impact parameters b=0-125 kpc (physical) at <z>=2.2. The ensemble provides a spatial map of cool gas as a function of galactocentric distance for a well-characterized population of galaxies. We propose a simple model that simultaneously matches the kinematics, depth, and profile shape of IS absorption and Lya emission lines, as well as the observed variation of absorption line strength (of HI, CII, CIV, SiII, SiIV) versus galactocentric impact parameter. We discuss the results of the observations in the context of ""cold accretion"", in which cool gas accretes via filamentary streams directly onto the central regions of galaxies. At present, we find little observational support for cool infalling material, whereas evidence supporting the large-scale effects of outflows is strong. Reconciling theory and observation on the subject of gas flows into and out of forming galaxies seems necessary.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
New nuclear structure features in transactinide nuclei,"The structural evolution of the heavy nuclei, with Z > 82, is investigated by looking at the differential variation of the two-neutron separation energies. It indicates, by non-monotonous behavior at certain neutron numbers, structure phenomena such as major shell (N = 126) and deformed subshell (N = 152) closures. Another interesting effect is observed at N ~ 142, which is very well correlated with a previously observed, intriguing behavior of quantities measured in alpha decay, such as relative branching ratios and hindrance factors of excited states from the ground state band of deformed nuclei in this region. Corroboration of the existing experimental data indicates another possible deformed subshell closure.",nucl,nucl-th,Is the LHCb $P_c(4312)^+$ plausible in the GlueX $\gamma p\to J/\psi p$ total cross sections ?,"New high-statistics total cross section data for $\gamma p\to J/\psi p$ from the GLUonic EXcitation (GlueX) experiment are fitted in a search for the exotic $P_c(4312)^+$ state observed by the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) collaboration. The integrated luminosity of this GlueX experiment was about $320~\mathrm{pb^{-1}}$. The fits show that destructive interference involving an $S$-wave resonance and associated non-resonance background produces a sharp dip structure about $75~\mathrm{MeV}$ below the LHCb mass, in the same location as a similar structure is seen in the data. Limitations of the employed model and the need for improved statistics are discussed.",nucl,nucl-ex,0
Fermions with no fundamental charges call for extra dimensions,"We call attention to that if assuming no conserved charges in the fundamental theory with fermions, which carry only a spin and interact with only the gravity, the dimensions $4, 12, 20,.....,$ as well as all odd dimensions, are excluded under the requirement of mass protection. If more than one family is required, than only dimensions d=2 (mod 4) remains as acceptable, since then other by 4 devisable dimensions are excluded.",hep,hep-th,Implications of Dynamical Generation of Standard-Model Fermion Masses,"We point out that if quark and lepton masses arise dynamically, then in a wide class of theories the corresponding running masses $m_{f_j}(p)$ exhibit the power-law decay $m_{f_j}(p) \propto \Lambda_j^2/p^2$ for Euclidean momenta $p >> \Lambda_j$, where $f_j$ is a fermion of generation $j$, and $\Lambda_j$ is the maximal scale relevant for the origin of $m_{f_j}$. We estimate resultant changes in precision electroweak quantities and compare with current data. It is found that this data allows the presence of such corrections. We also note that this power-law decay renders primitively divergent fermion mass corrections finite.",hep,hep-ph,0
Low-energy effective Hamiltonian involving spin-orbit coupling in Silicene and Two-Dimensional Germanium and Tin,"Starting from the symmetry aspects and tight-binding method in combination with first-principles calculation, we systematically derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian involving spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for silicene, which is very general because this Hamiltonian applies to not only the silicene itself but also the low-buckled counterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn, as well as graphene when the structure returns to the planar geometry. The effective Hamitonian is the analogue to the first graphene quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) Hamiltonian. Similar to graphene model, the effective SOC in low-buckled geometry opens a gap at Dirac points and establishes QSHE. The effective SOC actually contains first order in the atomic intrinsic SOC strength $\xi_{0}$, while such leading order contribution of SOC vanishes in planar structure. Therefore, silicene as well as low-buckled counterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn has much larger gap opened by effective SOC at Dirac points than graphene due to low-buckled geometry and larger atomic intrinsic SOC strength. Further, the more buckled is the structure, the greater is the gap. Therefore, QSHE can be observed in low-buckled Si, Ge, and Sn systems in an experimentally accessible temperature regime. In addition, the Rashba SOC in silicene is intrinsic due to its own low-buckled geometry, which vanishes at Dirac point $K$, while has nonzero value with $\vec{k}$ deviation from the $K$ point. Therefore, the QSHE in silicene is robust against to the intrinsic Rashba SOC.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,The phase diagram of the multi-dimensional Anderson localization via analytic determination of Lyapunov exponents,"The method proposed by the present authors to deal analytically with the problem of Anderson localization via disorder [J.Phys.: Condens. Matter {\bf 14} (2002) 13777] is generalized for higher spatial dimensions D. In this way the generalized Lyapunov exponents for diagonal correlators of the wave function, $<\psi^2_{n,\mathbf{m}}>$, can be calculated analytically and exactly. This permits to determine the phase diagram of the system. For all dimensions $D > 2$ one finds intervals in the energy and the disorder where extended and localized states coexist: the metal-insulator transition should thus be interpreted as a first-order transition. The qualitative differences permit to group the systems into two classes: low-dimensional systems ($2\leq D \leq 3$), where localized states are always exponentially localized and high-dimensional systems ($D\geq D_c=4$), where states with non-exponential localization are also formed. The value of the upper critical dimension is found to be $D_0=6$ for the Anderson localization problem; this value is also characteristic of a related problem - percolation.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,0
Electric Vehicles and their Effect on Network Load,"The composition of the fleet of road cars is changing from fuel powered cars to plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and electrical vehicles (EV). The (electrical) range of these vehicles is limited, leading to so called `range anxiety'. Firstly, this leads to a preference of shorter routes. Secondly, (PH)EVs have the ability to regenerate energy from braking, which make routes with many accerelations and decelerations not as unattractive for drivers of (PH)EVs as for drivers of vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICE). This paper combines this, and adds drivers might prefer a lower speed limit due to a lower energy consumption. These elements are compared to with road characteristics. It is found, motorways are usually less favourable for drivers of (PH)EVs compared to drivers of ICE vehicles, and they will prefer the shorter routes on secondary roads or through towns. This will influence the use of the underlying road network, and thereby affecting congestion, emissions and safety. This shift towards the underlying road network needs to be taken into account in designs for the network.",physics,physics.soc-ph,Beam extraction studies at 900 GeV using a channeling crystal,"Luminosity-driven channeling extraction has been observed for the first time in a 900 GeV study at the Fermilab Tevatron. This experiment, Fermilab E853, demonstrated that useful TeV level beams can be extracted from a superconducting accelerator during high luminosity collider operations without unduly affecting the background at the collider detectors. Multi-turn extraction was found to increase significantly the efficiency of the process. The beam extraction efficiency was about 25%. Studies of time dependent effects found that the turn-to-turn structure was governed mainly by accelerator beam dynamics. An investigation of a pre-scatterer using the accelerator flying wire system showed that a fiber could produce a significant extracted flux, consistent with expectations. Based on these results, it is feasible to construct a parasitic 5-10 MHz proton beam from the Tevatron collider.",physics,physics.acc-ph,0
Hyperon-nucleon interactions in the $p p \to K^+ \Lambda p$ reaction,"We present calculations of the invariant mass spectra of the $\Lambda$p system for the exclusive $p p \to K^+ \Lambda p$ reaction with the aim of studying the final state interaction between the $\Lambda$-hyperon and the proton. The reaction is described within a meson exchange framework and the final state $\Lambda p$ interaction is incorporated through an off-shell t-matrix for the $\Lambda p \to \Lambda p$ scattering, constructed using the available hyperon-nucleon (YN) potentials. The cross sections are found to be sensitive to the type of YN potential used especially at the $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ production thresholds. Hence, data on this exclusive reaction, which can be used to constrain the YN potentials are desirable.",nucl,nucl-th,A Hidden Local Field Theory Description of Dileptons in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions,This paper has been withdrawn by the authors.

Multi-wavelength view of an M2.2 Solar Flare on 26 November 2000,"In this paper, we present a study of an M2.2 class solar flare of 26 November 2000 from NOAA AR 9236. The flare was well observed by various ground based observatories (ARIES, Learmonths Solar Observatory) and space borne instruments (SOHO, HXRS, GOES) in time interval between 02:30 UT to 04:00 UT. The flare started with long arc-shape outer flare ribbon. Afterwards the main flare starts with two main ribbons. Initially the outer ribbons start to expand with an average speed ($\sim$ 20 km s$^{-1}$) and later it shows contraction. The flare was associated with partial halo coronal mass ejection (CMEs) which has average speed of 495 km s$^{-1}$. The SOHO/MDI observations show that the active region was in quadrupolar magnetic configuration. The flux cancellation was observed before the flare onset close to flare site.

In this article, we are performing different analyses for multiple frequencies, from gamma-rays to radio, as well as, the C IV ${\lambda}$1549 {\AA} emission line and the ${\lambda}$1350 {\AA} continuum. Using the non-thermal dominance parameter, we separated the C IV and the continuum light curves for when the dominant source of continuum is the accretion disk or the jet. We found a correlation at a delay consistent with zero between the line and the continuum dominated by disk emission indicating a very small broad-line region (BLR). From the resulting delay between the 15 GHz and gamma-rays, we estimated the distance of the gamma-ray emission region from the jet apex to be $\sim$37 pc. The C IV flux decreases when the continuum and gamma-rays increase at some of the high activity periods. The C IV profile presents a larger variable component in its blue wing. The relation between the luminosities of C IV and the continuum does not completely follow the relation for a quasar sample. Our results lead us to propose an outflow of BLR material in the jet-flow direction, a gamma-ray production through magnetic reconnection for the flaring event of mid-2011, and that there is not enough BLR material close to the radio core to be easily ionized by the non-thermal continuum.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,0
The Dortmund Low Background Facility - Low-Background Gamma Ray Spectrometry with an Artificial Overburden,"High-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors used for low-background gamma ray spectrometry are usually operated under either a fairly low overburden of the order of one meter of water equivalent (mw.e.) or a high overburden of the order of 100mw.e. or more, e.g. in specialized underground laboratories. The Dortmund Low Background Facility (DLB) combines the advantages of both approaches. The artificial overburden of 10mw.e. already shields the hadronic component of cosmic rays. The inner shielding, featuring a state-of-the-art neutron shielding and an active muon veto, enables low-background gamma ray spectrometry at an easy-accessible location at the campus of the Technische Universit\""at Dortmund. The integral background count rate between 40keV and 2700keV is 2.528+-0.004counts/kg/minute.

Entanglement of skeletal regions,"The entanglement entropy (EE) encodes key properties of quantum many-body systems. It is usually calculated for subregions of finite volume (or area in 2d). In this work, we study the EE of skeletal regions that have \textit{no} volume, such as a line in 2d. We show that skeletal entanglement displays new behavior compared to its bulk counterpart, and leads to distinct universal quantities. We provide non-perturbative bounds for the skeletal area-law coefficient of a large family of quantum states. We then explore skeletal scaling for the toric code, conformal bosons and Dirac fermions, Lifshitz critical points, and Fermi liquids. We discover signatures including skeletal topological EE, novel corner terms, and strict area-law scaling for metals. These findings suggest that skeletal entropy serves as a measure for the range of entanglement. We discuss the possibility of a continuum description involving the fusion of defect operators. Finally, we outline open questions relating to other systems, and measures such as the logarithmic negativity.",hep,hep-th,The Tiny (g-2) Muon Wobble from Small-$\mu$ Supersymmetry,"A new measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment has been reported by the Fermilab Muon g-2 collaboration and shows a $4.2\sigma$ departure from the most precise and reliable calculation of this quantity in the Standard Model. Assuming that this discrepancy is due to new physics, we concentrate on a simple supersymmetric model that also provides a dark matter explanation in a previously unexplored region of supersymmetric parameter space. Such interesting region can realize a Bino-like dark matter candidate compatible with all current direct detection constraints for small to moderate values of the Higgsino mass parameter $|\mu|$. This in turn would imply the existence of light additional Higgs bosons and Higgsino particles within reach of the high-luminosity LHC and future colliders. We provide benchmark scenarios that will be tested in the next generation of direct dark matter experiments and at the LHC.",hep,hep-ex,0
Small-$x$ Helicity Evolution: an Operator Treatment,"We rederive the small-$x$ evolution equations governing quark helicity distribution in a proton using solely an operator-based approach. In our previous works on the subject, the evolution equations were derived using a mix of diagrammatic and operator-based methods. In this work, we re-derive the double-logarithmic small-$x$ evolution equations for quark helicity in terms of the ""polarized Wilson lines"", the operators consisting of light-cone Wilson lines with one or two non-eikonal local operator insertions which bring in helicity dependence. For the first time we give explicit and complete expressions for the quark and gluon polarized Wilson line operators, including insertions of both the gluon and quark sub-eikonal operators. We show that the double-logarithmic small-$x$ evolution of the ""polarized dipole amplitude"" operators, made out of regular light-cone Wilson lines along with the polarized ones constructed here, reproduces the equations derived in our earlier works. The method we present here can be used as a template for determining the small-$x$ asymptotics of any transverse momentum-dependent (TMD) quark (or gluon) parton distribution functions (PDFs), and is not limited to helicity.",nucl,nucl-th,Neutron density distributions from antiprotonic 208Pb and 209Bi atoms,The X-ray cascade from antiprotonic atoms was studied for 208Pb and 209Bi.

Organization Mining Using Online Social Networks,"Mature social networking services are one of the greatest assets of today's organizations. This valuable asset, however, can also be a threat to an organization's confidentiality. Members of social networking websites expose not only their personal information, but also details about the organizations for which they work. In this paper we analyze several commercial organizations by mining data which their employees have exposed on Facebook, LinkedIn, and other publicly available sources. Using a web crawler designed for this purpose, we extract a network of informal social relationships among employees of a given target organization. Our results, obtained using centrality analysis and Machine Learning techniques applied to the structure of the informal relationships network, show that it is possible to identify leadership roles within the organization solely by this means. It is also possible to gain valuable non-trivial insights on an organization's structure by clustering its social network and gathering publicly available information on the employees within each cluster. Organizations wanting to conceal their internal structure, identity of leaders, location and specialization of branches offices, etc., must enforce strict policies to control the use of social media by their employees.",physics,physics.soc-ph,Short range gravitational fields: Rise and fall of the fifth force,"During the 80's, some experiments and the repetitions of old ones, lead to the hypothesis of a fifth force.

Probing anomalous quartic $\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma$ couplings in light-by-light collisions at the CLIC,"The anomalous quartic neutral couplings of the $\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma$ vertex in a polarized light-by-light scattering of the Compton backscattered photons at the CLIC are examined. Both differential and total cross sections are calculated for $e^+e^-$ collision energies 1500 GeV and 3000 GeV. The helicity of the initial electron beams is taken to be $\pm\,0.8$. The unpolarized and SM cross sections for the same values of helicities are also estimated. The 95\% C.L. exclusion limits on two anomalous photon couplings $\zeta_1$ and $\zeta_2$ are calculated. The best bounds on these couplings are found to be $6.85 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{\ GeV}^{-4}$ and $1.43 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{\ GeV}^{-4}$, respectively. The results are compared with the exclusion bounds obtained previously for the LHC and HL-LHC.

Our trial function is an alternative to the widely used isobar model and includes both nonresonant three-body interactions and two-body rescattering amplitudes, based on coupled channels and resonances, for S- and P-waves with isospin $0$ and $1$. The latter are unitarized in the $K$-matrix approximation and represent the only source of complex phases in the problem. Free parameters are just resonance masses and coupling constants, with transparent physical meanings. The nonresonant component, given by chiral symmetry as a real polynomium, is an important prediction of the model, which goes beyond the (2+1) approximation. Our approach allows one to disentangle the two-body scalar contributions with different isospins, associated with the $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ channels.

Second, the source term of the scheme is simple and contains no velocity gradient terms. Owing to this feature, the scheme is easy to implement. In addition, the singularity problem at the axis can be appropriately handled without affecting an important advantage of the lattice Boltzmann method: the easy treatment of boundary conditions. The scheme is tested by simulating Hagen-Poiseuille flow, three-dimensional Womersley flow, Wheeler benchmark problem in crystal growth, and lid-driven rotational flow in cylindrical cavities.

We consider the critical case ($\alpha=1$). Using an exact diagonalization scheme on finite chains, we compute the participation moments of all stationary energy eigenstates as well as the spreading of an initially localized wave-packet. The eigenstates multifractality is characterized by the set of fractal dimensions of the participation moments. The wave-packet shows a diffusive-like spread developing a power-law tail and achieves a stationary non-uniform profile after reflecting at the chain boundaries. As a consequence, the time-dependent participation moments exhibit two distinct scaling regimes.

Phase synchronization between collective rhythms of globally coupled oscillator groups: noiseless non-identical case,"Phase synchronization between collective oscillations exhibited by two weakly interacting groups of non-identical phase oscillators with internal and external global sinusoidal coupling of the groups is analyzed theoretically. Coupled amplitude equations describing the collective oscillations of the oscillator groups are obtained by using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, and then coupled phase equations for the collective oscillations are derived by phase reduction of the amplitude equations. The collective phase coupling function, which determines the dynamics of macroscopic phase differences between the groups, is calculated analytically. It is demonstrated that the groups can exhibit effective anti-phase collective synchronization even if the microscopic external coupling between individual oscillator pairs belonging to different groups is in-phase, and similarly effective in-phase collective synchronization in spite of microscopic anti-phase external coupling between the groups.",nlin,nlin.AO,Conservation Laws of Variable Coefficient Diffusion-Convection Equations,"We study local conservation laws of variable coefficient diffusion-convection equations of the form $f(x)u_t=(g(x)A(u)u_x)_x+h(x)B(u)u_x$.

That is why, for the class under consideration we first construct the usual equivalence group $G^{\sim}$ and the extended one $\hat G^{\sim}$ including transformations which are nonlocal with respect to arbitrary elements. The extended equivalence group $\hat G^{\sim}$ has interesting structure since it contains a non-trivial subgroup of gauge equivalence transformations. Then, using the most direct method, we carry out two classifications of local conservation laws up to equivalence relations generated by $G^{\sim}$ and $\hat G^{\sim}$, respectively.

A Fast Algorithm for Calculation of Th\^eo1,"Th\^eo1 is a frequency stability statistic which is similar to the Allan variance but can provide stability estimates at longer averaging factors and with higher confidence. However, the calculation of Th\^eo1 is significantly slower than the Allan variance, particularly for large data sets, due to a worse computational complexity. A faster algorithm for calculating the `all-$\tau$' version of Th\^eo1 is developed by identifying certain repeated sums and removing them with a recurrence relation. The new algorithm has a reduced computational complexity, equal to that of the Allan variance. Computation time is reduced by orders of magnitude for many datasets. The new, faster algorithm does introduce an error due to accumulated floating point errors in very large datasets. The error can be compensated for by increasing the numerical precision used at critical steps.

We show for the first time that it can simultaneously act on two vibration modes in opposite direction: noise on one mode is amplified whereas it is damped on another mode. Basic modeling of photothermal BA shows that dynamical effect on mechanical mode is laser spot position dependent with respect to mode shape.

However, for Parker Solar Probe, this correlation has not produced quantitative density estimates over extended periods of time because it depends on the energy dependent exponential variation of the photoemission spectrum, the electron temperature, the ratio of the biased surface area to the conducting spacecraft surface area, the spacecraft secondary or thermal emission, the spacecraft distance from the Sun, etc. In this paper the density as a function of time and frequency to frequencies as high as the electron gyrofrequency is determined through least squares fits of a function of the spacecraft potential to the plasma density measured on the Parker Solar Probe. This function allows correction for the many effects on the spacecraft potential other than that due to the plasma density.

The present model supports the emergence of a robust Z=14 subshell gap in 48Ca, that persists as one reaches the neutron-rich isotone 42Si. Yet the proton removal from 48Ca results in a significant erosion of the N=28 shell in 42Si. Finally, the removal of s1/2 protons from 48Ca causes a ~50% reduction of the spin-orbit splitting among neutron p-orbitals in 42Si.",nucl,nucl-ex,Ab initio coupled-cluster study of 16-O,"We report converged results for the ground and excited states and matter density of 16-O using realistic two-body nucleon-nucleon interactions and coupled-cluster methods and formalism developed in quantum chemistry. Most of the binding is obtained with the coupled-cluster singles and doubles approach. Additional binding due to three-body clusters (triples) is minimal. The coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles provides a good description of the matter density, charge radius, charge form factor, and excited states of a 1-particle-1-hole nature, but it cannot describe the first excited 0+ state. Incorporation of triples has no effect on the latter finding.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Nonequilibrium Free Energy-Like Functional for the KPZ Equation,"Opposing to a (common) belief against the existence of a thermodynamic-like potential for the KPZ equation, here we present a derivation for such a functional. With its knowledge we prove some global shift invariance properties previously conjectured by other authors. The procedure could be extended in order to derive a more general form of such a functional leading to other known related nonlinear kinetic equations. Exploiting the KPZ's functional, and for arbitrary dimension, we have obtained the exact form of the stationary probability distribution function and have shown a couple of examples of how it is possible to exploit it in order to obtain relevant results like finding support to the conjecture that in the strong coupling regime a critical dimension doesn't exists.",nlin,nlin.PS,Analyzing the Effects of Fifth and Seventh Order Terms in a Generalized Henon-Heiles Potential,"In 1962, astronomers Michel H\'enon and Carl Heiles studied orbits of stars around centers of galaxies to determine the third integral of motion in galactic dynamics. In order to do this, they reduced the system down to a 2-dimensional axisymmetric Hamiltonian system. Now this is known as the H\'enon-Heiles (HH) System. Due to its apparent simplicity but extremely complicated dynamical behavior, this system is currently a paradigm in dynamical systems. In this paper, we perform a series expansion up to the seventh order of a potential with axial and reflection symmetries. After some transformations, this turns into the generalized H\'enon-Heiles (GHH) system where we separate the fifth and seventh-order terms. We qualitatively analyze this system for energies near the threshold between bounded and unbounded motion with Poincar\'e sections and quantitatively analyze with Lyapunov Exponents. We find that particles far from the critical energy demonstrate less chaos. Additionally, the fifth-order term creates more regularity while the seventh-order term does the opposite.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
On Liquid Viscosity Effects on Droplet Splash and Receding Breakup on a Smooth Solid Surface at Atmospheric Pressure,"Experimental and modelling study is presented for the effect of a wide range of liquid viscosities on the droplet impact on a smooth solid surface at atmospheric pressure. A non-monotonic variation of threshold between droplet deposition and splash was observed experimentally. Specifically, the critical Weber number separating deposition from splashing decreases and then increases with increasing the Ohnesorge number. The observations of splash in low viscosity region and receding breakup in high viscosity region were analyzed qualitatively from the perspectives of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and Rayleigh-Taylor instability, respectively. Based on instability analysis for the viscosityinduced nonmonotonicity, a new semi-empirical correlation of droplet splashing thresholds is proposed by fitting experimental results from previous and present data and shows better performance than previous correlation formulas.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,Effect of dispersity of particle length on the electrical conductivity of the two-dimensional systems,"By means of computer simulation, we examined effect of dispersity of filler length on electrical conductivity of two-dimensional (2D) composites with rod-like fillers.

Gas-liquid phase equilibrium in ionic fluids: Coulomb versus non-Coulomb interactions,"Using the collective variables theory, we study the effect of competition between Coulomb and dispersion forces on the gas-liquid phase behaviour of a model ionic fluid, i.e. a charge-asymmetric primitive model with additional short-range attractive interactions. Both the critical parameters and the coexistence envelope are calculated in a one-loop approximation as a function of the parameter $\alpha$ measuring the relative strength of the Coulomb to short-range interactions. We found the very narrow region of $\alpha$ bounded from the both sides by tricritical points which separates the models with ""nonionic"" and ""Coulombic"" phase behaviour. This is at variance with the result of available computer simulations where no tricritical point is found for the finely-discretized lattice version of the model.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Fast and scalable quantum information processing with two-electron atoms in optical tweezer arrays,"Atomic systems, ranging from trapped ions to ultracold and Rydberg atoms, offer unprecedented control over both internal and external degrees of freedom at the single-particle level. They are considered among the foremost candidates for realizing quantum simulation and computation platforms that can outperform classical computers at specific tasks. In this work, we describe a realistic experimental toolbox for quantum information processing with neutral alkaline-earth-like atoms in optical tweezer arrays. In particular, we propose a comprehensive and scalable architecture based on a programmable array of alkaline-earth-like atoms, exploiting their electronic clock states as a precise and robust auxiliary degree of freedom, and thus allowing for efficient all-optical one- and two-qubit operations between nuclear spin qubits. The proposed platform promises excellent performance thanks to high-fidelity register initialization, rapid spin-exchange gates and error detection in readout. As a benchmark and application example, we compute the expected fidelity of an increasing number of subsequent SWAP gates for optimal parameters, which can be used to distribute entanglement between remote atoms within the array.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,0
Generating functions of wormholes,"It is known that wormhole geometry could be found solving the Einstein field equations by tolerating the violation of null energy condition (NEC). Violation of NEC is not possible for the physical matter distributions, however, can be achieved by considering distributions of ""exotic matter"". The main purpose of this work is to find generating functions comprising the wormhole like geometry and discuss the nature of these generating functions. We have used the Herrera et al. \cite{1} approaches of obtaining generating functions in the background of wormhole spacetime. Here we have adopt two approaches of solving the field equations to find wormhole geometry. In the first method, we have assumed the redshift function $f(r)$ and the shape function $b(r)$ and solve for the generating functions. In an another attempt we assume generating functions and redshift functions and then try to find shape functions of the wormholes.",physics,physics.gen-ph,Programmable DNA-mediated multitasking processor,"Because of DNA appealing features as perfect material, including minuscule size, defined structural repeat and rigidity, programmable DNA-mediated processing is a promising computing paradigm, which employs DNAs as information storing and processing substrates to tackle the computational problems.

As an example of multitasking capability, we present an in vitro programmable DNA-mediated optimal route planning processor as a functional unit embedded in contemporary navigation systems. The novel programmable DNA-mediated processor has several advantages over the existing silicon-mediated methods, such as conducting massive data storage and simultaneous processing via much fewer materials than conventional silicon devices.",physics,physics.bio-ph,0
Novel Heavy Quark Phenomena in QCD,"Heavy quarks provide a new dimension to QCD, allowing tests of fundamental theory, the nature of color confinement, and the production of new exotic multiquark states. I also discuss novel explanations for several apparently anomalous experimental results, such as the large $t \bar t$ forward-backward asymmetry observed in $p \bar p$ colisions at the Tevatron, the large rates for $\gamma$ or $Z$ plus high-$p_T$ charm jets observed at the Tevatron, the strong nuclear absorption of the $J/\psi$ observed in $pA$ collisions at the LHC, as well as fixed target experiments at high $x_F$. Precision measurements of the heavy quark distribution in hadrons at high $x$ are needed since intrinsic heavy quarks can play an important role in high $x$ phenomenology as well as predicting a new mechanism for high-$x_F$ Higgs production. The role of multi-parton interactions, such as di-gluon initiated subprocesses for forward quarkonium hadroproduction, is discussed. I also briefly discuss a new approach to the QCD confinement potential and the origin of the QCD mass scale based on AdS/QCD, light-front holography and a unique extension of conformal theory. The renormalization scale ambiguity can be eliminated at finite orders in pQCD using the scheme-independent PMC procedure, thus increasing the precision of predictions and eliminating an unnecessary source of theoretical systematic error.",hep,hep-ph,Electroproduction of Dijets at Small Jet Separation,"Dijet production in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) in the range 150 < Q^2 < 35000 GeV^2 has been measured by the H1 collaboration using the Durham jet algorithm in the laboratory frame.

Ultra-high Q whispering-gallery-mode bottle microresonators: properties and applications,"Highly prolate-shaped whispering-gallery-mode ""bottle microresonators"" have recently attracted considerable attention due to their advantageous properties. We experimentally show that such resonators offer ultra-high quality factors, microscopic mode volumes, and near lossless in- and out-coupling of light using ultra-thin optical fibers. Additionally, bottle microresonators have a simple and customizable mode structure. This enables full tunability using mechanical strain and simultaneous coupling of two ultra-thin coupling fibers in an add-drop configuration. We present two applications based on these characteristics: In a cavity quantum electrodynamics experiment, we actively stabilize the frequency of the bottle microresonator to an atomic transition and operate it in an ultra-high vacuum environment in order to couple single laser-cooled atoms to the resonator mode. In a second experiment, we show that the bottle microresonator can be used as a low-loss, narrow-band add-drop filter. Using the Kerr effect of the silica resonator material, we furthermore demonstrate that this device can be used for single-wavelength all-optical signal processing.",physics,physics.optics,Importance of the advection scheme for the simulation of water isotopes over Antarctica by atmospheric general circulation models: A case study for present-day and Last Glacial Maximum with LMDZ-iso,"Atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are known to have a warm and isotopically enriched bias over Antarctica. We test here the hypothesis that these biases are partly consequences of a too diffusive advection. Exploiting the LMDZ-iso model, we show that a less diffusive representation of the advection, especially on the horizontal, is very important to reduce the bias in the isotopic contents of precipitation above this area. The choice of an appropriate representation of the advection is thus essential when using GCMs for paleoclimate applications based on polar water isotopes. Too much diffusive mixing along the poleward transport leads to overestimated isotopic contents in water vapor because dehydration by mixing follows a more enriched path than dehydration by Rayleigh distillation. The near-air surface temperature is also influenced, to a lesser extent, by the diffusive properties of the advection scheme directly via the advection of the air and indirectly via the radiative effects of changes in high cloud fraction and water vapor. A too diffusive horizontal advection increases the temperature and so also contributes to enrich the isotopic contents of water vapor over Antarctica through a reduction of the distillation. The temporal relationship, from Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present-day conditions, between the mean annual near-air surface temperature and the water isotopic contents of precipitation for a specific location can also be impacted, with significant consequences on the paleo-temperature reconstruction from observed changes in water isotopes.",physics,physics.ao-ph,0
Form factors of $P\to T$ transition within the light-front quark models,"In this paper, we calculate the vector, axial-vector and tensor form factors of $P\to T$ transition within the standard light-front~(SLF) and covariant light-front~(CLF) quark models~(QMs). The self-consistency and Lorentz covariance of CLF QM with two types of correspondence schemes are investigated. The zero-mode effects and the spurious $\omega$-dependent contributions to the form factors of $P\to T$ transition are analyzed. Employing a self-consistent CLF QM, we present our numerical predictions for the vector, axial-vector and tensor form factors of $c\to (q,s)$~($q=u,d$) induced $D \to (a_2,K^*_2)$, $D_s \to (K^*_2,f'_{2})$, $\eta_c(1S) \to (D^*_2,D^*_{s2})$, $ B_c \to (B^*_2,B^*_{s2})$ transitions and $b\to (q,s,c)$ induced $B \to (a_2,K^*_2,D^*_2)$, $B_s \to (K^*_2,f'_2,D^*_{s2})$, $B_c \to (D^*_2,D^*_{s2},\chi_{c2}(1P))$, $\eta_b(1S) \to (B^*_2,B^*_{s2})$ transitions. Finally, in order to test the obtained form factors, the semileptonic $B\to \bar{D}_2^*(2460)\ell^+\nu_\ell$~($\ell=e,\mu$) and $\bar{D}_2^*(2460)\tau^+\nu_{\tau}$ decays are studied.

Nonlinear coupling of flow harmonics in heavy-ion collisions,"Anisotropic flow coefficients beyond triangular flow receive important contributions from lower-order harmonics through nonlinear coupling. We present a theoretical framework which allows one to quantify the contribution induced by such nonlinear couplings to any flow harmonic of any order. We show the effectiveness of this formalism through an application to hexagonal flow, $V_6$. We study, in particular, the coupling of $V_6$ to triangular flow, $V_3$, in Pb+Pb collisions at $~\sqrt[]{s}=2.76$ TeV, using both Large Hadron Collider data and event-by-event hydrodynamic calculations.",nucl,nucl-ex,Pauli resonance states in light nuclei: how they appear and how they can be eliminated,"Systematic analysis of parameters and properties of the Pauli resonance states are performed for light nuclei $^{6}$Li, $^{7}$Li, $^{8}$Be, $^{9}$Be and $^{10}$B, which are treated as two-cluster systems. The Pauli resonance states are redundant solutions of the resonating group method appearing when one try use more advanced description of the internal structure of interacting clusters. Our calculations are performed in a standard and advanced versions of the resonating group method. The standard version employs wave functions of many-particle shell model to describe internal motion of nucleons within each cluster. The advanced version is based on three-cluster resonating group method. As in the standard version, the internal wave functions of three clusters are approximated by wave functions of many-particle shell model model. However, in advanced version one of pair of clusters forms a bound state, and third cluster is considered to interact with such state. It is found that the Pauli resonance states in nuclei under consideration have energy between 11 and 46 MeV, and their widths vary from 8 keV to 6.7 MeV. Analysis of wave functions of Pauli resonance states and matrix elements of norm kernel allowed us to formulate an effective method for eliminating Pauli resonance states. It is demonstrated that this method effectively eliminate all determined the Pauli resonance states.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Interacting spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates,"The recent experimental realization of spin-orbit (SO) coupling for spin-1 ultracold atoms opens an interesting avenue for exploring SO-coupling-related physics in large-spin systems, which is generally unattainable in electronic materials. In this paper, we study the effects of interactions between atoms on the ground states and collective excitations of SO-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the presence of a spin-tensor potential. We find that ferromagnetic interaction between atoms can induce a stripe phase exhibiting in-phase or out-of-phase modulating patterns between spin-tensor and zero-spin-component density waves. We characterize the phase transitions between different phases using the spin-tensor density as well as the collective dipole motion of the BEC. We show that there exists a double maxon-roton structure in the Bogoliubov-excitation spectrum, attributed to the three band minima of the SO-coupled spin-1 BEC.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Intrinsic and dislocation induced elastic behavior of solid helium,"Recent experiments showed that the shear modulus of solid 4He stiffens in the same temperature range (below 200 mK) where mass decoupling and supersolidity have been inferred from torsional oscillator measurements. The two phenomena are clearly related and crystal defects, particularly dislocations, appear to be involved in both. We have studied the effects of annealing and the effects of applying large stresses on the elastic properties of solid 4He, using both acoustic resonances and direct low-frequency and low-amplitude measurements of the shear modulus. Both annealing and stressing affect the shear modulus, as expected if dislocations are responsible. However, it is the high temperature modulus which is affected; the low temperature behavior is unchanged and appears to reflect the intrinsic modulus of solid helium. We interpret this behavior in terms of dislocations which are pinned by isotopic 3He impurities at low temperatures and so have no effect on the shear modulus. At higher temperatures they become mobile and weaken the solid. Stressing the crystal at low temperatures appears to introduce new defects or additional pinning sites for the dislocation network but these effects can be reversed by heating the crystal above 500 mK. This is in contrast to dislocations produced during crystal growth, which are only annealed at temperatures close to melting.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,0
On the relationship of coastal tropical rainfall and the large-scale atmosphere,"Rainfall in coastal areas of the tropics is often shaped by the presence of circulations directly associated with the topography, such as land-sea and/or mountain-valley breezes. In many regions the coastally-affected rainfall consitutes more than half of the overall rainfall received. Weather and climate models with parametrized convection produce large errors in rainfall in tropical coastal regions, most commonly underestimating rainfall over land and overestimating it over the ocean. Building on an algorithm to objectively identify rainfall that is associated with land-sea interaction we investigate whether the relationship between rainfall in coastal regions and the large-scale atmosphere differs from that over the open ocean or over inland areas. We combine 3-hourly satellite estimates of rainfall with estimates of the large-scale atmospheric state from reanalyses. We find that when grouped by rainfall intensity, medium-intensity coastal rainfall in the tropics occurs in more stable conditions and drier atmospheres and is associated with less large-scale convergence than its open-ocean and inland counterparts. Overall, the dependence of the amount of rainfall on the large-scale state is significantly weaker when the rainfall is coastally influenced. Our findings indicate that the representation of convection in weather and climate models must cater for the special character of the large-to-small scale relationship near coasts rather than rely on a common set of rules across the globe.",physics,physics.ao-ph,"Foundry manufacturing of tight-confinement, dispersion-engineered, ultralow-loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuit","The foundry development of integrated photonics has revolutionized today's optical interconnect and datacenters. Over the last decade, we have witnessed the rising of silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) integrated photonics, which is currently transferring from laboratory research to foundry manufacturing. The development and transition are triggered by the ultimate need of low optical loss offered by Si$_3$N$_4$, which is beyond the reach of silicon and III-V semiconductors. Combined with modest Kerr nonlinearity, tight optical confinement and dispersion engineering, Si$_3$N$_4$ has today become the leading platform for linear and Kerr nonlinear photonics, and has enabled chip-scale lasers featuring ultralow noise on par with table-top fiber lasers. However, so far all the reported fabrication processes of tight-confinement, dispersion-engineered Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic integrated circuit (PIC) with optical loss down to few dB/m have only been developed on 4-inch or smaller wafers. Yet, to transfer these processes to established CMOS foundries that typically operate 6-inch or even larger wafers, challenges remain. In this work, we demonstrate the first foundry-standard fabrication process of Si$_3$N$_4$ PIC with only 2.6 dB/m loss, thickness above 800 nm, and near 100% fabrication yield on 6-inch wafers. Such thick and ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ PIC enables low-threshold generation of soliton frequency combs. Merging with advanced heterogeneous integration, active ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ integrated photonics could pave an avenue to addressing future demands in our increasingly information-driven society.",physics,physics.app-ph,0
The Most General Propagator in Quantum Field Theory,"One of the most important mathematical tools necessary for Quantum Field Theory calculations is the field propagator. Applications are always done in terms of plane waves and although this has furnished many magnificent results, one may still be allowed to wonder what is the form of the most general propagator that can be written. In the present paper, by exploiting what is called polar form, we find the most general propagator in the case of spinors, whether regular or singular, and we give a general discussion in the case of vectors.",hep,hep-th,Screening in Hot SU(2) Gauge Theory and Propagators in 3d Adjoint Higgs model,"We investigate the large distance behavior of the electric and magnetic propagators of hot SU(2) gauge theory in different gauges using lattice simulations of the full 4d theory and the effective, dimensionally reduced 3d theory. A comparison of the 3d and 4d data for the propagators suggests that dimensional reduction works surprisingly well down to temperatures T=2 T_c.

Classical Inflationary and Ekpyrotic Universes in the No-Boundary Wavefunction,"This paper investigates the manner in which classical universes are obtained in the no-boundary quantum state. In this context, universes can be characterised as classical (in a WKB sense) when the wavefunction is highly oscillatory, i.e. when the ratio of the change in the amplitude of the wavefunction becomes small compared to the change in the phase. In the presence of a positive or negative exponential potential, the WKB condition is satisfied in proportion to a factor $e^{-(\epsilon - 3)N/(\epsilon -1)},$ where $\epsilon$ is the (constant) slow-roll/fast-roll parameter and $N$ designates the number of e-folds. Thus classicality is reached exponentially fast in $N$, but only when $\epsilon < 1$ (inflation) or $\epsilon > 3$ (ekpyrosis). Furthermore, when the potential switches off and the ekpyrotic phase goes over into a phase of kinetic domination, the level of classicality obtained up to that point is preserved. Similar results are obtained in a cyclic potential, where a dark energy plateau is added. Finally, for a potential of the form $-\phi^n$ (with $n=4,6,8$), where the classical solution becomes increasingly kinetic-dominated, there is an initial burst of classicalisation which then quickly levels off. These results demonstrate that inflation and ekpyrosis, which are the only dynamical mechanisms known for smoothing the universe, share the perhaps even more fundamental property of rendering space and time classical in the first place.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations in Lense--Thirring precession model - I. variability of relativistic continuum,"We develop a Monte-Carlo code to compute the Compton scattered X-ray flux arising from a hot inner flow which undergoes Lense-Thirring precession. The hot flow intercepts seed photons from an outer truncated thin disk. A fraction of the Comptonized photons will illuminate back the disk and the reflected/reprocessed photons will contribute to the observed spectrum. The total spectrum, including disk thermal emission, hot flow Comptonization, and disk reflection, is modelled within the framework of general relativity, taking light-bending and gravitational redshift into account. The simulations are performed in the context of the Lense-Thirring precession model for the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, so the inner flow is assumed to precess, leading to periodic modulation of the emitted radiation. In this work, we concentrate on the energy-dependent X-ray variability of the model and, in particular, on the evolution of the variability during the spectral transition from hard to soft state, which is implemented by the decrease of the truncation radius of the outer disk towards Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO). In the hard state where the Comptonizing flow is geometrically thick, the Comptonization is weakly variable with the fractional variability amplitude of $\leq$10\%; in the soft state where the Comptonizing flow is cooled down and thus becomes geometrically thin, and the fractional variability of the Comptonization is highly variable, increasing with photon energy. The fractional variability of the reflection increases with energy, and the reflection emission for low spin is counterintuitively more variable than the one for high spin.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,0
Dynamics of Darwinian versus Baldwinian versus Lamarckian evolution,"In recent years, studies in epigenetic inheritance in biological systems as well as studies on evolution in non-biological systems e.g., machine learning and robotics, have reopened the discussion of non-Darwinian methods of evolutionary optimization. In this paper, the three most prominent classical evolutionary strategies Lamarckian, Darwinian, and Baldwinian are implemented and compared in an agent-based simulation. The dynamics of optimization and learning are studied in constant as well as in dynamic environments, both as single evolutionary strategy populations and as mixed evolutionary strategy populations. The three different agent types are implemented as simple objects that need to gather resources to replicate. The agent fitness is defined through a bitstring match between the agent and the environment and to replicate each agent needs to gather sufficient resources. To make a fair comparison between the three different evolutionary methods, we can assume that both the ability to learn within an individual's lifetime and the learning process itself require additional resources compared to an evolutionary process without lifetime learning. When all three strategies coexist and we vary the replication costs for the different strategies we find the following general pattern: The evolutionary advantage decreases for Lamarckian and Baldwinian strategies as their learning costs increase and/or as their relative replication costs increase compared to the Darwinian strategies, and in most situations the Baldwinian strategy performs in between the Darwinian and Lamarckian strategies. Finally, as our investigations emphasize the superiority of the Lamarckian strategy in most cases with low learning cost, it is interesting to note that a corresponding biological inheritance mechanism did not evolve, while the Lamarckian strategy is currently extensively used in technology applications.",nlin,nlin.AO,Topological Valley Hall Edge State Lasing,"Topological lasers based on topologically protected edge states offer unique features and enhanced robustness of operation in comparison with conventional lasers, even in the presence of disorder, edge deformation, and localized defects. Here we propose a new class of topological lasers arising from the valley Hall edge states, which does not require external magnetic fields or dynamical modulations of the device parameters. Specifically, topological lasing occurs at domain walls between two honeycomb waveguide arrays with broken spatial inversion symmetry. Two types of valley Hall edge lasing modes are found by shaping the gain landscape along the domain walls. In the presence of uniform losses and two-photon absorption, lasing in edge states results in the formation of stable nonlinear dissipative excitations localized on the edge of the structure, even if it has complex geometry and even if it is finite. Robustness of lasing states is demonstrated in both periodic and finite structures, where such states can circumvent sharp corners without scattering loss or radiation into the bulk. The photonic structure and mechanism proposed here for topological lasing is fundamentally different from those previously demonstrated topological lasers and can be used for fabrication of practical topological lasers of various geometries.",nlin,nlin.PS,0

Two mechanisms underlying the chaos-suppression scenario are identified. One mechanism requires chaos-inducing and chaos-suppressing waves to have both commensurate wavelengths and commensurate relative (with respect to the remaining third wave) phase velocities, while the other mechanism allows the chaotic dynamics to be tamed when such quantities are incommensurate. The present findings may be directly applied to several important problems in plasma physics, including that of the chaos-induced destruction of magnetic surfaces in tokamaks.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
DOF phase separation of the Lennard-Jones fcc(111) surface,"Recent lattice model calculations have suggested that a full-layered crystal surface may undergo, under canonical (particle-conserving) conditions, a preroughening-driven two-dimensional phase separation into two disordered flat (DOF) regions, of opposite order parameter. We have carried out extensive classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the Lennard-Jones fcc(111) surface, to check whether these predictions are relevant or not for a realistic continuous system. Very long simulation times, a grid of temperatures from (2/3)Tm to Tm, and unusually large system sizes are employed to ensure full equilibrium and good statistics. By examining layer-by-layer occupancies, height fluctuations, sublattice order parameter and X-ray structure factors, we find a clear anomaly at ~0.83Tm.

The R$\bar{3}$m symmetry and phase have been confirmed by the Rietveld refinement of x-ray diffraction data. Interestingly, a magnetic field induced phase transition from semi-metallic to semi-conducting type is found with the energy gap around 80 meV at 15 Tesla in the $x=$ 0 sample. Moreover, we observe linear behavior of MR up to 15 Tesla in transverse mode and SdH oscillations in longitudinal mode where the field direction is with respect to the current and crystal plane. For the parent sample, we found the coherence length L$_\phi=$ 12.7 nm through the fitting of MR data in transverse mode with modified H-L-N equation. The extracted frequencies of SdH oscillations using the fast Fourier transform method and Landau level (LL) fan diagram are found to be consistent for the parent and Ni doped samples. The determined Fermi surface area is found to be slightly larger in Ni doped as compared to the parent sample possibly due to change in the Fermi energy. The Kohler's plot indicates a single scattering mechanism below 100 K. More importantly, the analysis with the help of LL fan diagram reveals the non-zero Berry phase $\phi_{\rm B}= -$(1$\pm$0.1)$\pi$, which demonstrates the non-trivial topological states near the Dirac point in the parent and Ni doped samples.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,0

It is shown to excite acoustic waves putting certain restrictions upon their geometry of the generated wavefront. The results are discussed in relation to flare generated sunquakes.,astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,0
Quarkonium Production At $Z^0$ and in $\Upsilon(1S)$ Decay,"The conventional color-singlet model was challenged by the recent data on quarkonium production. Discrepancies in production rates were observed at the Tevatron, at LEP, and in fixed-target experiments. The newly advocated color-octet mechanism provides a plausible solution to the anomalous quarkonium production observed at the Tevatron. The color-octet mechanism should also affect other quarkonium production channels. In this paper we will summarize the studies of quarkonium production in $Z^0$ and $\Upsilon$ decays.",hep,hep-ph,Lattice simulation of $QC_2D$ with $N_f=2$ at non-zero baryon density,"The lattice simulations of $QC_2D$ with two flavors of staggered fermions and non-zero quark chemical potential $\mu_q$ have been performed. Dependencies of the Polyakov loop, chiral condensate and baryon number density on $\mu_q$ were studied. We found that an increase of the baryon chemical potential leads to chiral symmetry restoration. At small values of $\mu_q$, our results for the baryon number density agree with ChPT predictions.",hep,hep-lat,0
Antihyperon potentials in nuclei via exclusive antiproton-nucleus reactions at FAIR,"The exclusive production of hyperon-antihyperon pairs close to their production threshold in antiproton - nucleus collisions offers a unique and hitherto unexplored opportunity to elucidate the behaviour of antihyperons in nuclei. For the first time we analyse these reactions in a microscopic transport model using the the Gie\ss en Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model. The calculation take the delicate interplay between the strong absorption of antihyperons, their rescattering and refraction at the nuclear surface as well as the Fermi motion of the struck nucleon into account. We find a substantial sensitivity of transverse momentum correlations of coincident $\Lambda\overline{\Lambda}$-pairs to the assumed depth of the $\overline{\Lambda}$-potential. Because of the high cross section for this process and the simplicity of the experimental method our results are highly relevant for future activities at the international Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR).",nucl,nucl-th,Is early thermalization achieved only near midrapidity at RHIC ?,"The pseudorapidity dependence of elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at 130 $A$ GeV is studied within a full three-dimensional hydrodynamic model in the light-cone coordinate. First, we prepare two initial conditions in the hydrodynamic model for analyzing elliptic flow. Both initial conditions lead to reasonable agreement with single particle spectra in central and semi-central collisions. Next, by using these hydrodynamic simulations, we compare elliptic flow as a function of pseudorapidity with experimental data recently measured by the PHOBOS Collaboration. Our results are in agreement with experimental data only near midrapidity. This suggests that thermalization in the early stage of collisions is not achieved in forward and backward rapidity regions.",nucl,nucl-ex,0

Self-localization of directed polymers and oppressive population control,"We construct a phenomenological theory of self-localization of directed polymers in d+1 dimensions. In d=1 we show that the polymer is always self-localized, whereas in d=2 there is a phase transition between localized and free states. We also map this system to a model of population dynamics with fixed total population. Our previous results translate to static and expanding population clusters, depending on the birth and death rates.

We calculate the one particle irreducible function and the self-energy up to two-loop order. Using renormalization group arguments we show that in the forward scattering channel the renormalized coupling constant is never infrared stable due to the flat FS sectors. Furthemore we show that the self-energy scales with energy as ${\rm Re} \Sigma \sim \omega \ln \omega $ as $\omega \to 0$, and thus the Fermi liquid state within each FS patch is turned into a marginal Fermi liquid.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,0
Imaging and Modeling Data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array,"We analyze data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array. This is the third in a series of papers on the closure phase delay-spectrum technique designed to detect the HI 21cm emission from cosmic reionization. We present the details of the data and models employed in the power spectral analysis, and discuss limitations to the process. We compare images and visibility spectra made with HERA data, to parallel quantities generated from sky models based on the GLEAM survey, incorporating the HERA telescope model. We find reasonable agreement between images made from HERA data, with those generated from the models, down to the confusion level. For the visibility spectra, there is broad agreement between model and data across the full band of $\sim 80$MHz. However, models with only GLEAM sources do not reproduce a roughly sinusoidal spectral structure at the tens of percent level seen in the observed visibility spectra on scales $\sim 10$ MHz on 29 m baselines. We find that this structure is likely due to diffuse Galactic emission, predominantly the Galactic plane, filling the far sidelobes of the antenna primary beam. We show that our current knowledge of the frequency dependence of the diffuse sky radio emission, and the primary beam at large zenith angles, is inadequate to provide an accurate reproduction of the diffuse structure in the models. We discuss implications due to this missing structure in the models, including calibration, and in the search for the HI 21cm signal, as well as possible mitigation techniques.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,"A ${\bf 1.4}$ deg${\bf ^2}$ blind survey for CII], CIII] and CIV at ${\bf z\sim0.7-1.5}$. I: nature, morphologies and equivalent widths","While traditionally associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN), the properties of the CII] ($\lambda=2326$\,{\AA}), CIII] ($\lambda,\lambda=1907,1909$\,{\AA}) and CIV ($\lambda,\lambda=1549, 1551$\,{\AA}) emission lines are still uncertain as large, unbiased samples of sources are scarce. We present the first blind, statistical study of CII], CIII] and CIV emitters at $z\sim0.68,1.05,1.53$, respectively, uniformly selected down to a flux limit of $\sim4\times10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ through a narrow band survey covering an area of $\sim1.4$ deg$^2$ over COSMOS and UDS. We detect 16 CII], 35 CIII] and 17 CIV emitters, whose nature we investigate using optical colours as well as HST, X-ray, radio and far infra-red data. We find that $z\sim0.7$ CII] emitters are consistent with a mixture of blue (UV slope $\beta=-2.0\pm0.4$) star forming galaxies with disky HST structure and AGN with Seyfert-like morphologies. Bright CII] emitters have individual X-ray detections as well as high average black hole accretion rates (BHAR) of $\sim0.1$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. CIII] emitters at $z\sim1.05$ trace a general population of SF galaxies, with $\beta=-0.8\pm1.1$, a variety of optical morphologies, including isolated and interacting galaxies and low BHAR ($<0.02$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). Our CIV emitters at $z\sim1.5$ are consistent with young, blue quasars ($\beta\sim-1.9$) with point-like optical morphologies, bright X-ray counterparts and large BHAR ($0.8$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). We also find some surprising CII], CIII] and CIV emitters with rest-frame equivalent widths which could be as large as $50-100$ {\AA}. AGN or spatial offsets between the UV continuum stellar disk and the line emitting regions may explain the large EW. These bright CII], CIII] and CIV emitters are ideal candidates for spectroscopic follow up to fully unveil their nature.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,0
Scaling and universality in binary fragmenting with inhibition,"We investigate a new model of binary fragmentation with inhibition, driven by the white noise. In a broad range of fragmentation probabilities, the power-law spatiotemporal correlations are found to arise due to self-organized criticality (SOC).

Such models include variable mass sine-Gordon model, cylindrical NLS, spin chains with impurity, inhomogeneous Toda chain, the Ablowitz-Ladik model etc.",nlin,nlin.SI,0
Subhaloes gone Notts: Subhaloes as tracers of the dark matter halo shape,"We study the shapes of subhalo distributions from four dark-matter-only simulations of Milky Way type haloes. Comparing the shapes derived from the subhalo distributions at high resolution to those of the underlying dark matter fields we find the former to be more triaxial if theanalysis is restricted to massive subhaloes. For three of the four analysed haloes the increased triaxiality of the distributions of massive subhaloes can be explained by a systematic effect caused by the low number of objects. Subhaloes of the fourth halo show indications for anisotropic accretion via their strong triaxial distribution and orbit alignment with respect to the dark matter field. These results are independent of the employed subhalo finder. Comparing the shape of the observed Milky Way satellite distribution to those of high-resolution subhalo samples from simulations, we find an agreement for samples of bright satellites, but significant deviations if faint satellites are included in the analysis. These deviations might result from observational incompleteness.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Spatially Offset Active Galactic Nuclei III: Discovery of Late-Stage Galaxy Mergers with The Hubble Space Telescope,"Galaxy pairs with separations of only a few kpc represent important stages in the merger-driven growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, such mergers are difficult to identify observationally due to the correspondingly small angular scales. In Paper I we presented a method of finding candidate kpc-scale galaxy mergers that is leveraged on the selection of X-ray sources spatially offset from the centers of host galaxies. In this paper we analyze new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 imaging for six of these sources to search for signatures of galaxy mergers. The HST imaging reveals that four of the six systems are on-going galaxy mergers with separations of 1.2-6.6 kpc (offset AGN). The nature of the remaining two spatially offset X-ray sources is ambiguous and may be associated with super-Eddington accretion in X-ray binaries. The ability of this sample to probe small galaxy separations and minor mergers makes it uniquely suited for testing the role of galaxy mergers for AGN triggering. We find that galaxy mergers with only one AGN are predominantly minor mergers with mass ratios similar to the overall population of galaxy mergers. By comparison, galaxy mergers with two AGN are biased toward major mergers and larger nuclear gas masses. Finally, we find that the level of SMBH accretion increases toward smaller mass ratios (major mergers). This result suggests the mass ratio effects not only the frequency of AGN triggering but also the rate of SMBH growth in mergers.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0
Quarkonium+$\gamma$ production in coherent hadron - hadron interactions at LHC energies,"In this paper we study the $H + \gamma$ ($H = J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$) production in coherent hadron - hadron interactions at LHC energies. Considering the ultrarelativistic protons as a source of photons, we estimate the $\gamma + p \rightarrow H + \gamma + X$ cross section using the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism and considering different sets of values for the matrix elements. Our results for the total $ p + p \rightarrow p + H + \gamma + X$ cross sections and rapidity distributions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ and 14 TeV demonstrate that the experimental analysis of the $J/\Psi + \gamma$ production at LHC is feasible.",hep,hep-ex,The QCD spin chain S matrix,"Beisert et al. have identified an integrable SU(2,2) quantum spin chain which gives the one-loop anomalous dimensions of certain operators in large N QCD.

Generation of macroscopic singlet states in atomic ensembles,"We study squeezing of the spin uncertainties by quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement in non-polarized spin ensembles. Unlike the case of polarized ensembles, the QND measurements can be performed with negligible back-action, which allows, in principle, perfect spin squeezing as quantified by [G. Toth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 250405 (2007)]. The generated spin states approach many-body singlet states, and contain a macroscopic number of entangled particles, even when individual spin is large. We introduce the Gaussian treatment of unpolarized spin states and use it to estimate the achievable spin squeezing for realistic experimental parameters. Our proposal might have applications for magnetometry with a high spatial resolution or quantum memories storing information in decoherence free subspaces.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,Response of Complex Systems to Complex Perturbations: the Complexity Matching Effect,"The dynamical emergence (and subsequent intermittent breakdown) of collective behavior in complex systems is described as a non-Poisson renewal process, characterized by a waiting-time distribution density $\psi (\tau)$ for the time intervals between successively recorded breakdowns. In the intermittent case $\psi (t)\sim t^{-\mu}$, with complexity index $\mu $. We show that two systems can exchange information through complexity matching and present theoretical and numerical calculations describing a system with complexity index $\mu_{S}$ perturbed by a signal with complexity index $\mu_{P}$. The analysis focuses on the non-ergodic (non-stationary) case $\mu \leq 2$ showing that for $\mu_{S}\geq \mu_{P}$, the system $S$ statistically inherits the correlation function of the perturbation $P$. The condition $\mu_{P}=\mu_{S}$ is a resonant maximum for correlation information exchange.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,0
Probing neutrino decay scenarios by using the Earth matter effects on supernova neutrinos,"The observation of Earth matter effects in the spectrum of neutrinos coming from a next galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) could, in principle, reveal if neutrino mass ordering is normal or inverted. One of the possible ways to identify the mass ordering is through the observation of the modulations that appear in the spectrum when neutrinos travel through the Earth before they arrive at the detector. These features in the neutrino spectrum depend on two factors, the average neutrino energies, and the difference between the primary neutrino fluxes of electron and other flavors produced inside the supernova. However, recent studies indicate that the Earth matter effect for CCSN neutrinos is expected to be rather small and difficult to be observed by currently operating or planned neutrino detectors mainly because of the similarity of average energies and fluxes between electron and other flavors of neutrinos, unless the distance to CCSN is significantly smaller than the typically expected one, $\sim 10$ kpc. Here, we are looking towards the possibility if the non-standard neutrino properties such as decay of neutrinos can enhance the Earth matter effect. In this work we show that invisible neutrino decay can potentially enhance significantly the Earth matter effect for both $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ channels at the same time for both mass orderings, even if the neutrino spectra between electron and other flavors of neutrinos are very similar, which is a different feature not expected for CCSN neutrinos with standard oscillation without the decay effect.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Nebular Attenuation in H\alpha-selected Star-forming Galaxies at z=0.8 from the NewH\alpha\ Survey,"We present measurements of the dust attenuation of H\alpha-selected emission-line galaxies at z=0.8 from the NewH\alpha\ narrowband survey. The analysis is based on deep follow-up spectroscopy with Magellan/IMACS, which captures the strong rest-frame optical emission lines from [OII] \lambda 3727 to [OIII] \lambda 5007. The spectroscopic sample used in this analysis consists of 341 confirmed H\alpha\ emitters. We place constraints on the AGN fraction using diagnostics which can be applied at intermediate redshift. We find that at least 5% of the objects in our spectroscopic sample can be classified as AGN and 2% are composite, i.e. powered by a combination of star-formation and AGN activity. We measure the dust attenuation for individual objects from the ratios of the higher order Balmer lines. The H\beta\ and H\gamma\ pair of lines is detected with S/N>5 in 55 individual objects and the H\beta\ and H\delta\ pair is detected in 50 individual objects. We also create stacked spectra to probe the attenuation in objects without individual detections. The median attenuation at H\alpha\ based on the objects with individually detected lines is A(H\alpha)=0.9+-1.0 magnitudes, in good agreement with the attenuation found in local samples of star-forming galaxies. We find that the z=0.8 galaxies occupy a similar locus of attenuation as a function of magnitude, mass and SFR as a comparison sample drawn from the SDSS DR4. Both the results from the individual z=0.8 galaxies and from the stacked spectra show consistency with the mass -- attenuation and SFR -- attenuation relations found in the local Universe, indicating that these relations are also applicable at intermediate redshift.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,0
The collapse transition on superhydrophobic surfaces,"We investigate the transition between the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states of a slowly evaporating, micron-scale drop on a superhydrophobic surface. In two dimensions analytical results show that there are two collapse mechanisms. For long posts the drop collapses when it is able to overcome the free energy barrier presented by the hydrophobic posts. For short posts, as the drop loses volume, its curvature increases allowing it to touch the surface below the posts. We emphasise the importance of the contact line retreating across the surface as the drop becomes smaller: this often preempts the collapse. In a quasi-three dimensional simulation we find similar behaviour, with the additional feature that the drop can de-pin from all but the peripheral posts, so that its base resembles an inverted bowl.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Magnetic resonance studies of the fundamental spin-wave modes in individual submicron Cu/NiFe/Cu perpendicularly magnetized disks,"Spin wave spectra of perpendicularly magnetized disks with trilayers consisting of a 100 nm permalloy (Py) layer sandwiched by two Cu layers of 30 nm, are measured individually with a Magnetic Resonance Force Microscope (MRFM).

An efficient method for computing the Thouless-Valatin inertia parameters,"Starting from the adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation (ATDHF), we propose an efficient method to calculate the Thouless-Valatin moments of inertia for the nuclear system. The method is based on the rapid convergence of the expansion of the inertia matrix. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified in the rotational case by comparing the results with the exact Thouless-Valatin moments of inertia calculated using the self-consistent cranking model. The proposed method is computationally much more efficient than the full ATDHF calculation, yet it retains a high accuracy of the order of 1%.",nucl,nucl-th,Is early thermalization achieved only near midrapidity at RHIC ?,"The pseudorapidity dependence of elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at 130 $A$ GeV is studied within a full three-dimensional hydrodynamic model in the light-cone coordinate.

Front propagation in three-dimensional corrugated reaction-diffusion media,"Propagation of traveling fronts in three-dimensional reaction-diffusion media with spatially modulated cross-section is studied using the Schl\""ogl model as a representative example. Applying appropriate perturbation techniques leads first to a reduction of dimensionality in which the spatially dependent Neumann boundary condition translate into a boundary-induced advection term and, secondly, to an equation of motion for the traveling wave position in weakly corrugated confinements. Comparisons with numerical simulations demonstrate that our analytical results properly predicts the nonlinear dependence of the propagation velocity on ratio of the spatial period of the confinement to the intrinsic width of the front; including the peculiarity of propagation failure. Based on the eikonal equation, we obtain an analytical estimate for the finite interval of propagation failure. Lastly, we demonstrate that the front velocity is determined by the suppressed diffusivity of the reactants if the intrinsic width of the front is much larger than the spatial variation of the medium.",nlin,nlin.PS,D-dimensional developed MHD turbulence: Double expansion model,"Developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence near two dimensions $d$ up to three dimensions has been investigated by means of renormalization group approach and double expansion regularization. A modification of standard minimal subtraction scheme has been used to analyze the stability of the Kolmogorov scaling regime which is governed by the renormalization group fixed point. The exact analytical expressions have been obtained for the fixed points. The continuation of the universal value of the inverse Prandtl number $u=1.562$ determined at $d=2$ up to $d=3$ restores the value of $u=1.393$ which is known in the kinetic fixed point from usual $\epsilon$-expansion. The magnetic stable fixed point has been calculated and its stability region has been also examined. This point losses stability: (1) below critical value of dimension $d_c=2.36$ (independently on the $a$-parameter of a magnetic forcing) and, (2) below the value of $a_c=0.146$ (independently on the dimension).",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Generation of finite wave trains in excitable media,"Spatiotemporal control of excitable media is of paramount importance in the development of new applications, ranging from biology to physics. To this end we identify and describe a qualitative property of excitable media that enables us to generate a sequence of traveling pulses of any desired length, using a one-time initial stimulus. The wave trains are produced by a transient pacemaker generated by a one-time suitably tailored spatially localized finite amplitude stimulus, and belong to a family of fast pulse trains. A second family, of slow pulse trains, is also present. The latter are created through a clumping instability of a traveling wave state (in an excitable regime) and are inaccessible to single localized stimuli of the type we use. The results indicate that the presence of a large multiplicity of stable, accessible, multi-pulse states is a general property of simple models of excitable media.",nlin,nlin.PS,Hysteretic transition of coarse-grained power grid model on small-world network,"We study synchronous phenomena of a coarse-grained power grid model, the swing equation, on small-world networks.

In addition, we prove the linear stability of steady state with small-different phases between the adjacent oscillators. On the other hand, a trigger of instantaneous power failure, which is described by the hysteretic transition, might disappear on an appropriate small-world network. This result suggests that the small-world connection would potentially prevent the massive blackouts.",nlin,nlin.AO,0
Theory of Static and Dynamic Antiferromagnetic Vortices in LSCO Superconductors,"A key prediction of the SO(5) theory is the antiferromagnetic vortex state. Recent neutron scattering experiment on LSCO superconductors revealed enhanced antiferromagnetic order in the vortex state. Here we review theoretical progress since the original proposal and present a theory of static and dynamic antiferromanetic vortices in LSCO superconductors. It is shown that the antiferromagnetic region induced by the vortices can be greater than the coherence length, due to the light effective mass of the dynamic antiferromagnetic fluctuations at optimal doping, and close promixity to the antiferromagentic state in the underdoped regime.

By assuming that only the spin-S atoms do interact with the transverse field the exact results for the Gibbs free energy, longitudinal magnetization, transverse magnetization, entropy and specific heat have been derived and discussed in detail. In addition to the standard temperature variations of the transverse magnetization, another two non-trivial thermal dependences have been found.

Pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems in the presence of short-term memory,"We study reaction-diffusion systems beyond the Markovian approximation to take into account the effect of memory on the formation of spatio-temporal patterns. Using a non-Markovian Brusselator model as a paradigmatic example, we show how to use reductive perturbation to investigate the formation and stability of patterns. Focusing in detail on the Hopf instability and short-term memory, we derive the corresponding complex Ginzburg-Landau equation that governs the amplitude of the critical mode and we establish the explicit dependence of its parameters on the memory properties. Numerical solution of this memory dependent complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as well as direct numerical simulation of the non-Markovian Brusselator model illustrate that memory changes the properties of the spatio-temporal patterns. Our results indicate that going beyond the Markovian approximation might be necessary to study the formation of spatio-temporal patterns even in systems with short-term memory. At the same time, our work opens up a new window into the control of these patterns using memory.",nlin,nlin.PS,Symmetry broken states in an ensemble of globally coupled pendulums,"We consider the rotational dynamics in an ensemble of globally coupled identical pendulums. This model is essentially a generalization of the standard Kuramoto model, which takes into account the inertia and the intrinsic nonlinearity of the community elements. There exists the wide variety of in-phase and out-of-phase regimes. Many of these states appear due to broken symmetry. In the case of small dissipation our theoretical analysis allows one to find the boundaries of the instability domain of in-phase rotational mode for ensembles with arbitrary number of pendulums, describe all arising out-of-phase rotation modes and study in detail their stability. For the system of three elements parameter sets corresponding to the unstable in-phase rotations we find a number of out-of-phase regimes and investigate their stability and bifurcations both analytically and numerically. As a result, we obtain a sufficiently detailed picture of the symmetry breaking and existence of various regular and chaotic states.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Fundamental Physics with Electroweak Probes of Nuclei,"The past decade has witnessed tremendous progress in the theoretical and computational tools that produce our understanding of nuclei. A number of microscopic calculations of nuclear electroweak structure and reactions have successfully explained the available experimental data, yielding a complex picture of the way nuclei interact with electroweak probes. This achievement is of great interest from the pure nuclear-physics point of view. But it is of much broader interest too, because the level of accuracy and confidence reached by these calculations opens up the concrete possibility of using nuclei to address open questions in other sub-fields of physics, such as, understanding the fundamental properties of neutrinos, or the particle nature of dark matter. In this talk, I will review recent progress in microscopic calculations of electroweak properties of light nuclei, including electromagnetic moments, form factors and transitions in between low-lying nuclear states along with preliminary studies for single- and double-beta decay rates.

Stabilization of two-dimensional solitons in cubic-saturable nonlinear lattices,"We consider soliton dynamics and stability in a nonlinear lattice formed by alternating domains with focusing cubic and saturable nonlinearities.

Solitons centered on saturable domains are always unstable.",nlin,nlin.PS,Synchronization in networks of mobile oscillators,"We present a model of synchronization in networks of autonomous agents where the topology changes due to agents motion. We introduce two time scales, one for the topological change and another one for local synchronization. If the former scale is much shorter, an approximation that averages out the effect of motion is available. Here we show, however, that the time required for synchronization achievement increases with respect to that approximation in the opposite case. We find that this effect is more important close to the continuum percolation transition point. The simulation results are confirmed by means of spectral analysis of the time dependent Laplacian matrix. Our results show that the trade-off between these two time scales, which have opposite effects on synchronization, should be taken into account for the design of mobile device networks.",nlin,nlin.AO,0
The $1/N_c$ expansion in hadron effective field theory,"We study the $N_c$ scalings of pion-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon scatterings and find that a consistent large $N_c$ counting can be established if we assume Witten's counting rules are applied to matrix elements or scattering amplitudes which use the relativistic normalization for the nucleons. With the pionless effective field theory, we also find that the $S$-wave nucleon-nucleon interaction is so strong that it should be treated nonperturbatively at the leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion. By summing all the leading order diagrams, we find that the deuteron binding energy is of order $1/N_c$. In contrast, meson-meson interaction is so weak that loosely-bound meson-meson molecular states may not exist in the large $N_c$ limit.",hep,hep-ph,Jet separated by a large rapidity gap at the Tevatron and the LHC,"We compare the recent measurements of gap between jets at the Tevatron and the LHC with the Balitski Fadin Kuraev Lipatov framework.

Measuring the phase velocity of twisted wavefronts,"Traditionally one defines the speed of a wave as a property of the medium. Recent studies in photonics have challenged this idea, indicating that spatial shaping of the optical wavefront has can alter the arrival time of single photons when compared to an entangled reference photon. However, relying only on time of flight measurements leads to ambiguity in the measurement. Unlike photonics, one can directly measure the phase and intensity of sound, permitting unambiguous measurements. We developed a bespoke 28-element ultrasonic phased array transducer to generate short pulses that carrying orbital angular momentum. Through spatial mapping, we observed pulse modulation that indicates a localised change in phase velocity by over 10 m/s. We present a geometrical argument for this effect, proposing that the phase velocity varies to compensate for the effective path length increase arising from spatial wavefront shaping. We expect that this pulse dispersion is a general effect for any spatially shaped wavefront and that it could be utilised to manipulate readings from pulse based sensor technologies such as SONAR, medical ultrasound, and underwater communication systems.",physics,physics.class-ph,Memory and entropy,"I study the physical nature of traces (or memories).

I quantify these thermodynamical conditions for memory and derive an expression for the maximum amount of information stored in such memories, as a function of the relevant thermodynamical parameters. This mechanism transforms low entropy into available information.",physics,physics.hist-ph,0
Cumulative processes out off the nucleus fragmentation region,In this report the first results of cumulative particle production in the new kinematic region will be presented. The produced particles have momenta more than 2 GeV/c in the rest system of nuclear target. Such studies can significantly reduce the corrections associated with the processes of the initial(ISI) and final states(FSI) interactions.,nucl,nucl-ex,"Complementary studies on $N^*$ from $e^+e^-$, $pp$ and $p\bar p$ collisions","Complementary to the conventional experimental studies on $N^*$ from $\pi N$ and $\gamma^{(*)}N$ reactions, the $e^+e^-$, $pp$ and $p\bar p$ collisions can give novel insights into these $N^*$ resonances. While the $e^+e^-$ collisions through production and decay of vector charmonium $\psi$ provide a nice isospin filter for a simultaneously study of $N^*$, $\Delta^*$, $\Lambda^*$, $\Sigma^*$ and $\Xi^*$, the $pp$ collisions should be the best place for producing those $\Delta^{*++}$ with large coupling to $\rho^+p$ though $pp\to n\Delta^{*++}$ reaction, and the $p\bar p$ collisions should be the best place for looking for those $N^*$ with large coupling to $\sigma N$.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Discrete surface solitons in two-dimensional anisotropic photonic lattices,"We study nonlinear surface modes in two-dimensional {\em anisotropic} periodic photonic lattices and demonstrate that, in a sharp contrast to one-dimensional discrete surface solitons, the mode threshold power is lower at the surface, and two-dimensional discrete solitons can be generated easier near the lattice corners and edges. We analyze the crossover between effectively one- and two-dimensional regimes of the surface-mediated beam localization in the lattice.",nlin,nlin.PS,Examples of Synchronization in Discrete Chaotic Systems,"This paper presents an application of partial contraction analysis to the study of global synchronization in discrete chaotic systems. Explicit sufficient conditions on the coupling strength of networks of discrete oscillators are derived. Numerical examples and applications to simple systems are presented. Previous researches have shown numerically that the systems under study, when arranged in a network, exhibits rich and complex patterns that can dynamically change in response to variations in the environment. We show how this ``adaptation'' process strongly depends on the coupling characteristics of the network. Other potential applications of synchronized chaotic oscillators are discussed.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Propagator mixing renormalization for Majorana fermions,"We consider a mixed system of unstable Majorana fermions in a general parity-nonconserving theory and renormalize its propagator matrix to all orders in the pole scheme, in which the squares of the renormalized masses are identified with the complex pole positions and the wave-function renormalization (WFR) matrices are adjusted in compliance with the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formalism. In contrast to the case of unstable Dirac fermions, the WFR matrices of the in and out states are uniquely fixed, while they again bifurcate in the sense that they are no longer related by pseudo-Hermitian conjugation. We present closed analytic expressions for the renormalization constants in terms of the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and pseudovector parts of the unrenormalized self-energy matrix, which is computable from the one-particle-irreducible Feynman diagrams of the flavor transitions, as well as their expansions through two loops. In the case of stable Majorana fermions, the well-known one-loop results are recovered.",hep,hep-ph,Closed String Tachyons and Their Implications for Non-Supersymmetric Strings,"Closed string tachyons have long been somewhat mysterious. We note that there is often a regime in the classical moduli space in which one can systematically compute the effective action for such fields. In this regime, the tachyon is light, and cannot be integrated out. Instead, one must consider the combined dynamics of gravitons, moduli, tachyons and other light fields. We compute the action and find that the quartic term for the tachyon is positive in the field definition where the tachyon has no derivative coupling to the radion. We study the evolution of isotropic, homogeneous configurations and find that typically the system is driven to regions where the calculation is no longer under control.",hep,hep-th,0
How fast do structures emerge in hypercycle-systems?,"A general framework for the simulation of reaction-diffusion systems with probabilistic cellular automata is presented. The basic reaction probabilities of the chemical model translate directly into the transition rules of the automaton, thus allowing a clear comparison between simulation results and analytic calculations. This framework is then applied to simulations of hypercycle-systems in up to three dimensions. Furthermore, a new measurement quantity is introduced and applied to the hypercycle-systems in two and three dimensions. It can be shown that this quantity can be interpreted as a measure for the macroscopic order of the hypercycle systems.",nlin,nlin.AO,On the Deformations of Dorfman's and Sokolov's Operators,We deform the Dorfman's and Sokolov's Hamiltonian operators by the quasi-Miura transformation coming from the topological field theory and investigate the deformed operators.,nlin,nlin.SI,0
Deterministic Chaos and the Foundations of the Kinetic Theory of Gases,"Recent work in dynamical systems theory has shown that many properties that are associated with irreversible processes in fluids can be understood in terms of the dynamical properties of reversible, Hamiltonian systems. That is, stochastic-like behavior is possible for these systems. Here we review the basic theory for this stochastic-like behavior and show how it may be used to obtain an understanding of irreversible processes in gases and fluids. Recent, closely related, work on the use of kinetic theory to calculate dynamical quantities such as Lyapunov exponents is also discussed.",nlin,nlin.CD,The bi-Hamiltonian structure and new solutions of KdV6 equation,"We show that the KdV6 equation recently studied in [1,2] is equivalent to the Rosochatius deformation of KdV equation with self-consistent sources (RD-KdVESCS) recently presented in [9].

A cornucopia of antineutrons and hyperons from super J/psi factory for next-generation nuclear and particle physics high-precision experiments,"In order to study the interactions and structure of various types of matter one typically needs to carry out scattering experiments utilizing many different particles as projectiles. Whereas beams of $e^\pm$, $\mu^\pm$, $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, proton, antiproton, and of various heavy ions have been produced and have enabled many scientific breakthroughs, beams of antineutrons, hyperons ($\Lambda$, $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$) and their antiparticles are typically not easy to obtain. Here we point out and investigate a new high-quality source of these particles: a super $J/\psi$ factory with capability of accumulating trillions of $J/\psi$ decays each year. In the relevant $J/\psi$ decays the desired particle is produced together with other final state particles that can be tagged. This allows accurate determination of the flux and momentum of the projectile, enabling unprecedented precision-study of the corresponding interactions with a broad range of targets. These novel high-statistics sources of baryons and antibaryons with precisely known kinematics open fresh opportunities for applications in particle and nuclear physics, including antinucleon-nucleon interaction, nonvalence $s\bar{s}$ component of the nucleon, (anti)hyperon-nucleon interaction, OZI violation, (multi-strange) hypernuclei, exotic light hadron spectroscopy and many others, as well as calibration of Monte Carlo simulation for hadronic and medical physics.",hep,hep-ex,On early onset of quark number density at zero temperature,"We study a longstanding problem in lattice QCD at low temperature and nonzero quark chemical potential on an onset of the quark number density at $\mu=m_\pi/2$. We introduce a physical parametrization of the eigenvalues in the reduction formula of the fermion determinant. It is shown that the parametrization reduces the quark number density operator to an expression with the Fermi distribution of the quark. For each configuration, the eigenvalues of the reduced matrix correspond to one-particle energy states of a quark. The gap of the eigenspectrum of the reduced matrix corresponds to the gap of the energy states, which causes the $\mu$-independence of the fermion determinant for small $\mu$ at T=0. Once $\mu$ exceeds the gap, the quark number density becomes nonzero for each configuration, which causes the early onset of the quark number density.",hep,hep-lat,0
Wafer-level substrate-free low-stress silicon nitride platform for THz metadevices and monolithically integrated narrowband metamaterial absorbers,"The implementation of terahertz (THz) wafer-level metadevices is critical to advance the science for applications including (I) integrated focal plane array which can image for biology and (II) integrated narrowband absorbers for high spectral resolution THz spectroscopy. Substantial progress has been made in the development of THz metamaterials; however, a wafer-level low-stress THz metadevices platform remains a challenge. This paper experimentally demonstrates a substrate-free THz metadevices platform adopting engineered Si-rich and low-stress silicon nitride (SiNx) thin films, achieving an extensive THz transparency up to f = 2.5 THz. A new analytical model is first reported from the Lorentz model that can accurately predict spectral responses of metal insulator metal (MIM) metamaterial absorbers. The model is experimentally validated in the THz range and exploited for the first demonstration of a THz absorber, which exhibits performance approaching the predicted results. Our results show that the wafer-level SiNx platform will accelerate the development of large-scale, sophisticated substrate-free THz metadevices. The Lorentz model and its quadratic model will be a very practical method for designing THz metadevices.",physics,physics.app-ph,A Database for Storing the Results of Material Radiopurity Measurements,"Searches for rare nuclear processes, such as neutrinoless double beta-decay and the interactions of WIMP dark matter, are motivating experiments with ever-decreasing levels of radioactive backgrounds. These background reductions are achieved using various techniques, but amongst the most important is minimizing radioactive contamination in the materials from which the experiment is constructed. To this end there have been decades of advances in material sourcing, manufacture and certification, during which researchers have accumulated many thousands of measurements of material radiopurity. Some of these assays are described in publications, others are in databases, but many are still communicated informally. Until this work, there has been no standard format for encoding assay results and no effective, central location for storing them. The aim of this work is to address these long-standing problems by creating a concise and flexible material assay data format and powerful software application to manipulate it. A public installation of this software, available at http://www.radiopurity.org, is the largest database of assay results ever compiled and is intended as a long-term repository for the community's data.",physics,physics.ins-det,0
The dynamics of a shear band,"A shear band of finite length, formed inside a ductile material at a certain stage of a con- tinued homogeneous strain, provides a dynamic perturbation to an incident wave field, which strongly influences the dynamics of the material and affects its path to failure. The investigation of this perturbation is presented for a ductile metal, with reference to the incremental mechanics of a material obeying the J 2-deformation theory of plasticity (a special form of prestressed, elastic, anisotropic, and incompressible solid). The treatment originates from the derivation of integral representations relating the incremental mechan- ical fields at every point of the medium to the incremental displacement jump across the shear band faces, generated by an impinging wave. The boundary integral equations (under the plane strain assumption) are numerically approached through a collocation technique, which keeps into account the singularity at the shear band tips and permits the analysis of an incident wave impinging a shear band. It is shown that the presence of the shear band induces a resonance, visible in the incremental displacement field and in the stress intensity factor at the shear band tips, which promotes shear band growth. Moreover, the waves scattered by the shear band are shown to generate a fine texture of vibrations, par- allel to the shear band line and propagating at a long distance from it, but leaving a sort of conical shadow zone, which emanates from the tips of the shear band.",physics,physics.comp-ph,A critical point for bifurcation cascades and featureless turbulence,"In this Letter we show that a bifurcation cascade and fully sustained turbulence can share the phase space of a fluid flow system, resulting in the presence of competing stable attractors. We analyse the toroidal pipe flow, which undergoes subcritical transition to turbulence at low pipe curvatures and supercritical transition at high curvatures, as was previously documented. We provide decisive evidence that the nature of the supercritical transition is of Ruelle--Takens type and that, in a narrow range of intermediate curvatures, its dynamics competes with that of sustained turbulence emerging through subcritical transition mechanisms.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,0
Complex Societies and the Growth of the Law,"While a large number of informal factors influence how people interact, modern societies rely upon law as a primary mechanism to formally control human behaviour. How legal rules impact societal development depends on the interplay between two types of actors: the people who create the rules and the people to which the rules potentially apply. We hypothesise that an increasingly diverse and interconnected society might create increasingly diverse and interconnected rules, and assert that legal networks provide a useful lens through which to observe the interaction between law and society. To evaluate these propositions, we present a novel and generalizable model of statutory materials as multidimensional, time-evolving document networks. Applying this model to the federal legislation of the United States and Germany, we find impressive expansion in the size and complexity of laws over the past two and a half decades. We investigate the sources of this development using methods from network science and natural language processing. To allow for cross-country comparisons over time, we algorithmically reorganise the legislative materials of the United States and Germany into cluster families that reflect legal topics. This reorganisation reveals that the main driver behind the growth of the law in both jurisdictions is the expansion of the welfare state, backed by an expansion of the tax state.",physics,physics.soc-ph,Phase transition of the energy flux in the near-inertial wave--mesoscale eddy coupled turbulence,"Wind forcing injects energy into the mesoscale eddies and near-inertial waves (NIWs) in the ocean, and the NIW is believed to solve the puzzle of mesoscale energy budget by absorbing energy from mesoscale eddies followed by a forward cascade of NIW energy which finally dissipates at the ocean interior. This work studies the turbulent energy transfer in the NIW--quasigeostrophic mean mesoscale eddy coupled system based on a previously derived two-dimensional model which has a Hamiltonian structure and inherits conserved quantities in the Boussinesq equations (Xie \& Vanneste, \textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, vol. 774, 2015, pp. 147--169). Based on the conservation of energy, potential enstrophy and wave action, we propose a heuristic argument predicting the existence of phase transition with changing the relative strength between NIW and mean flow. By running forced-dissipative numerical simulations with varying parameter $R$, the ratio of the magnitude of NIW and mean-flow forcing, we justify the existence of phase transition, which is found to be second-order, around critical value $R_c$. When $0<R<R_c$, energy transfers bidirectionally, wave action transfers downscale, and vorticity form strong cyclones. While when $R>R_c$, energy transfers downscale, wave action transfers bidirectionally, and vortex filaments are dominant. We find the catalytic wave induction (CWI) mechanism where the NIW induces a downscale energy flux of the mean flow. The CWI mechanism differs from the stimulated loss of balance by the absence of energy conversion from the mesoscale eddy to NIW, and it is found to be effective in the toy-model study, making it potentially important for ocean energetics.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,0
Dynamics of Light Antiquarks in the Proton,"We present a comprehensive analysis of the recent data from the E866 experiment at Fermilab on Drell-Yan production in pD and pp collisions, which indicates a non-trivial x-dependence for the asymmetry between u-bar and d-bar quark distributions in the proton. The relatively fast decrease of the asymmetry at large x suggests the important role played by the chiral structure of the nucleon, in particular the pi-N and pi-Delta components of the nucleon wave function. At small x the data require an additional non-chiral component, which may be attributed to the Pauli exclusion principle as first suggested by Field and Feynman.",nucl,nucl-th,Direct photon production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV at STAR,We present the direct photon production for $1<p_{T}<10$ GeV/$c$ derived from continuum in the dielectron invariant mass region $0.1<M_{ee}<0.3$ GeV/$c^{2}$ from one billion $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV Au+Au events taken in year 2010 and 2011.

Effective three-body interactions in nuclei,"It is shown that the three-body forces in the $1f_{7/2}$ shell, for which recently evidence was found on the basis of spectroscopic properties of the Ca isotopes and $N=28$ isotones, can be most naturally explained as an effective interaction due to excluded higher-lying shells, in particular the $2p_{3/2}$ orbit.}",nucl,nucl-th,Hard Jet Substructure in a Multi-stage Approach,"We present predictions and postdictions for a wide variety of hard jet-substructure observables using a multi-stage model within the JETSCAPE framework. The details of the multi-stage model and the various parameter choices are described in [A. Kumar et al., arXiv:2204.01163]. A novel feature of this model is the presence of two stages of jet modification: a high virtuality phase (modeled using MATTER), where coherence effects diminish medium-induced radiation, and a lower virtuality phase (modeled using LBT), where parton splits are fully resolved by the medium as they endure multiple scattering induced energy loss. Energy loss calculations are carried out on event-by-event viscous fluid dynamic backgrounds constrained by experimental data. The uniformed and consistent descriptions of multiple experimental observables demonstrate the essential role of coherence effects and the multi-stage modeling of the jet evolution. Using the best choice of parameters from [A. Kumar et al., arXiv:2204.01163], and with no further tuning, we present calculations for the medium modified jet fragmentation function, the groomed jet momentum fraction $z_g$ and angular separation $r_g$ distributions, as well as the nuclear modification factor of groomed jets. These calculations provide accurate descriptions of published and preliminary data from experiments at RHIC and LHC. Furthermore, we provide predictions from the multi-stage model for future measurements at RHIC.",nucl,nucl-ex,0
Synchronous coordinates and gauge-invariant observables in cosmological spacetimes,"We consider the relational approach to construct gauge-invariant observables in cosmological perturbation theory using synchronous coordinates. We construct dynamical synchronous coordinates as non-local scalar functionals of the metric perturbation in the fully non-linear theory in an arbitrary gauge. We show that the observables defined in this dynamical coordinate system are gauge-independent, and that the full perturbed metric has the expected form in these coordinates. Our construction generalises the familiar synchronous gauge in linearised gravity, widely used in cosmological perturbation theory, to the non-linear theory. We also work out the expressions for the gauge-invariant Einstein equation, sourced either by an ideal fluid or a scalar field up to second order in perturbation theory, and give explicit expressions for the Hubble rate -- as measured by synchronous observers or by observers co-moving with the matter field -- up to that order. Finally, we consider quantised linear perturbations around Minkowski and de~Sitter backgrounds, and compute the two-point function of the gauge-invariant metric perturbation in synchronous coordinates, starting with two-point function in a general linear covariant gauge. Although the gauge-fixed two-point function contains gauge modes, we show that the resulting gauge-invariant two-point function only contains the physical tensor modes and it is thus positive, \ie, it has a spectral representation.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,From Supernova to Remnant: Tracking the Evolution of the Oldest Known X-ray Supernovae,"Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) expand into a medium created by winds from the pre-SN progenitor. The SN explosion and resulting shock wave(s) heat up the surrounding plasma, giving rise to thermal X-ray emission, which depends on the density of the emitting material. Tracking the variation of the X-ray luminosity over long periods of time thus allows for investigation of the kinematics of the SN shock waves, the structure of the surrounding medium, and the nature of the progenitor star. In this paper X-ray observations of five of the oldest known X-ray supernovae - SN 1970G, SN 1968D, SN 1959D, SN 1957D and SN 1941C - are analyzed, with the aim of reconstructing their light curves over several decades. For those supernovae for which we can extract multi-epoch data, the X-ray luminosity appears to decline with time, although with large error bars. No increase in the X-ray emission from SN 1970G is found at later epochs, contrary to previous reports. All five SNe show X-ray luminosities that are of comparable magnitude. We compare the late-time X-ray luminosities of these SNe to those of supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galaxy which are a few hundred years old, and find that when the tentative decline is taken into account, the luminosity of the old SNe studied herein could fall below the luminosity of some of the younger SNRs within a few hundred years. However, the X-ray luminosity should begin to increase as the SNe expand in the Sedov phase, thus reaching that of the observed SNRs.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,0
Pattern Transitions in Unstable Viscous Convective Medium,Convection in a thin layer of liquid (gas) with temperature dependent viscosity between poorly heat conducting boundaries is studied within framework of the Proctor-Sivashinsky model. This model is examined in order to study both the flow pattern formation and the second-order structural phase transitions as between patterns with translational invariance as well as between structures with broken translational invariance but keeping a long-range order. The spatial spectrum of arising patterns and estimation of their visual defectiveness are analyzed. The relation between the density of pattern defects and spectral characteristics of the pattern is found. We also discuss the noise effects on the formation of pattern defects. The influence of temperature dependence of viscosity on the process of pattern formation and structure transformations is also discussed. It is shown that the temperature dependence of viscosity inhibits structural transition from regular rolls to square cells.,nlin,nlin.PS,"Soliton solutions of non-linear Schrodinger (NLS) and Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equations related to zero curvature in the x,t plane","Soliton solutions of non-linear NLS and KdV equations are related to compatibility condition between matrices M and H describing the movement of an auxilary function Psi in the x,t plane with a zero curvature condition. Non-linear equation for a function u is obtained by the compatibility equation where the matrix elements of M and H include only functions of u and its derivatives. By solving the equations of motion for Psi a soliton solution for u is obtained.

Curing Braess' Paradox by Secondary Control in Power Grids,"Robust operation of power transmission grids is essential for most of today's technical infrastructure and our daily life. Adding renewable generation to power grids requires grid extensions and sophisticated control actions on different time scales to cope with short-term fluctuations and long-term power imbalance. Braess' paradox constitutes a counterintuitive collective phenomenon that occurs if adding new transmission line capacity to a network increases loads on other lines, effectively reducing the system's performance and potentially even entirely removing its operating state. Combining simple analytical considerations with numerical investigations on a small sample network, we here study dynamical consequences of secondary control in AC power grid models. We demonstrate that sufficiently strong control not only implies dynamical stability of the system but may also cure Braess' paradox. Our results highlight the importance of demand control in conjunction with grid topology for stable operation and reveal a new functional benefit of secondary control.",nlin,nlin.AO,Nonlinear Behaviour of Time-Stepping Algorithms for Initial Value Problems,"Recent advances in nonlinear dynamical systems theory provide a new insight into numerical properties of discrete algorithms developed to solve nonlinear initial value problems. Basic features like accuracy and stability are well pointed out through diagrams or maps of computed asymptotic solutions in a suitable parametric space. Applying this methodology to a nonlinear test equation, we compared some numerical features of the well known second-order Crank-Nicolson solver with those of a recent proposed version which is fourth-order accurate. The approach gives some useful indication on the capabilities of familiar and innovative ODE integrators when applied to nonlinear problems.",nlin,nlin.SI,0
Two-point correlation function studies for the Milky Way: discovery of spatial clustering from disk excitations and substructure,"We introduce a two-particle correlation function (2PCF) for the Milky Way, constructed to probe spatial correlations in the orthogonal directions of the stellar disk in the Galactic cylindrical coordinates of $R$, $\phi$, and $z$. We use this new tool to probe the structure and dynamics of the Galaxy using the carefully selected set of solar neighborhood stars ($d \lesssim 3\, \rm kpc$) from Gaia Data Release 2 we previously employed for studies of axial symmetry breaking in stellar number counts. We make additional, extensive tests, comparing to reference numerical simulations, to ensure our control over possibly confounding systematic effects. Supposing either axial or North-South symmetry we divide this data set into two nominally symmetric sectors and construct the 2PCF, in the manner of the Landy-Szalay estimator, from the Gaia data. In so doing, working well away from the mid-plane region in which the spiral arms appear, we have discovered distinct symmetry-breaking patterns in the 2PCF in its orthogonal directions, thus establishing the existence of correlations in stellar number counts at sub-kiloparsec length scales for the very first time. Particularly, we observe extensive wave-like structures of amplitude greatly in excess of what we would estimate if the system were in a steady state. We study the variations in these patterns across the Galactic disk, and with increasing $|z|$, and we show how our results complement other observations of non-steady-state effects near the Sun, such as vertical asymmetries in stellar number counts and the Gaia snail.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Testing protoplanetary disc dispersal with radio emission,"We consider continuum free-free radio emission from the upper atmosphere of protoplanetary discs as a probe of the ionized luminosity impinging upon the disc. Making use of previously computed hydrodynamic models of disc photoevaporation within the framework of EUV and X-ray irradiation, we use radiative transfer post-processing techniques to predict the expected free-free emission from protoplanetary discs. In general, the free-free luminosity scales roughly linearly with ionizing luminosity in both EUV and X-ray driven scenarios, where the emission dominates over the dust tail of the disc and is partial optically thin at cm wavelengths. We perform a test observation of GM Aur at 14-18 Ghz and detect an excess of radio emission above the dust tail to a very high level of confidence. The observed flux density and spectral index are consistent with free-free emission from the ionized disc in either the EUV or X-ray driven scenario. Finally, we suggest a possible route to testing the EUV and X-ray driven dispersal model of protoplanetary discs, by combining observed free-free flux densities with measurements of mass-accretion rates. On the point of disc dispersal one would expect to find a M_dot^2 scaling with free-free flux in the case of EUV driven disc dispersal or a M_dot scaling in the case of X-ray driven disc dispersal.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,0
Stable Charged Antiparallel Domain Walls in Hyperferroelectrics,"Charge-neutral 180$^\circ$ domain walls that separate domains of antiparallel polarization directions are common structural topological defects in ferroelectrics. In normal ferroelectrics, charged 180$^\circ$ domain walls running perpendicular to the polarization directions are highly energetically unfavorable because of the depolarization field and are difficult to stabilize. We explore both neutral and charged 180$^\circ$ domain walls in hyperferroelectrics, a class of proper ferroelectrics with persistent polarization in the presence of a depolarization field, using density functional theory. We obtain zero temperature equilibrium structures of head-to-head and tail-to-tail walls in recently discovered $ABC$-type hexagonal hyperferroelectrics. Charged domain walls can also be stabilized in canonical ferroelectrics represented by LiNbO$_3$ without any dopants, defects or mechanical clamping. First-principles electronic structure calculations show that charged domain walls can reduce and even close the band gap of host materials and support quasi-two-dimensional electron(hole) gas with enhanced electrical conductivity.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Analytical Calculation of Four-Point Correlations for a Simple Model of Cages Involving Numerous Particles,"Dynamics of a one-dimensional system of Brownian particles with short-range repulsive interaction (diameter sigma) is studied with a liquid-theoretical approach. The mean square displacement, the two-particle displacement correlation, and the overlap-density-based generalized susceptibility are calculated analytically by way of the Lagrangian correlation of the interparticulate space, instead of the Eulerian correlation of density that is commonly used in the standard mode-coupling theory. In regard to the mean square displacement, the linear analysis reproduces the established result on the asymptotic subdiffusive behavior of the system. A finite-time correction is given by incorporating the effect of entropic nonlinearity with a Lagrangian version of mode-coupling theory. The notorious difficulty in derivation of the mode-coupling theory concerning violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is found to disappear by virtue of the Lagrangian description. The Lagrangian description also facilitates analytical calculation of four-point correlations in the space-time, such as the two-particle displacement correlation. The two-particle displacement correlation, which is asymptotically self-similar in the space-time, illustrates how the cage effect confines each particle within a short radius on one hand and creates collective motion of numerous particles on the other hand. As the time elapses, the correlation length grows unlimitedly, and the generalized susceptibility based on the overlap density converges to a finite value which is an increasing function of the density. The distribution function behind these dynamical four-point correlations and its extension to three-dimensional cases, respecting the tensorial character of the two-particle displacement correlation, are also discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,0
A Pseudo-BCS Wavefunction from Density Matrix Decomposition:Application in Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo,"We present a method to construct pseudo-BCS wave functions from the one-body density matrix. The resulting many-body wave function, which can be produced for any fermion systems, including those with purely repulsive interactions, has the form of a number-projected BCS form, or antisymmetrized germinal power (AGP). Such wave functions provide a better ansatz for correlated fermion systems than a single Slater determinant, and often better than a linear combination of Slater determinants (for example from a truncated active space calculation). We describe a procedure to build such a wave function conveniently from a given reduced density matrix of the system, rather than from a mean-field solution (which gives a Slater determinant for repulsive interactions). The pseudo-BCS wave function thus obtained reproduces the density matrix or minimizes the difference between the input and resulting density matrices. One application of the pseudo-BCS wave function is in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) calculations as the trial wave function to control the sign/phase problem. AFQMC is often among the most accurate general methods for correlated fermion systems. We show that the pseudo-BCS form further reduces the constraint bias and leads to improved accuracy compared to the usual Slater determinant trial wave functions, using the two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example. Furthermore, the pseudo-BCS trial wave function allows a new systematically improvable self-consistent approach, with pseudo-BCS trial wave function iteratively generated by AFQMC via the one-body density matrix.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,J-shaped stress-strain diagram of collagen fibers: Frame tension of triangulated surfaces with fixed boundaries,"We present Monte Carlo data of the stress-strain diagrams obtained using two different triangulated surface models. The first is the canonical surface model of Helfrich and Polyakov (HP), and the second is a Finsler geometry (FG) model. The shape of the experimentally observed stress-strain diagram is called J-shaped. Indeed, the diagram has a plateau for the small strain region and becomes linear in the relatively large strain region. Because of this highly non-linear behavior, the J-shaped diagram is far beyond the scope of the ordinary theory of elasticity. Therefore, the mechanism behind the J-shaped diagram still remains to be clarified, although it is commonly believed that the collagen degrees of freedom play an essential role. We find that the FG modeling technique provides a coarse-grained picture for the interaction between the collagen and the bulk material. The role of the directional degrees of freedom of collagen molecules or fibers can be understood in the context of FG modeling. We also discuss the reason for why the J-shaped diagram cannot (can) be explained by the HP (FG) model.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,0
Effective size of a trapped atomic Bose gas,"We investigate the temperature-dependent effective size of a trapped interacting atomic Bose gas within a mean field theory approximation.

The thickness of a liquid layer on the free surface of ice as obtained from computer simulation,"Molecular dynamic simulations were performed for ice Ih with a free surface by using four water models, SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ice and TIP4P/2005. The behavior of the basal plane, the primary prismatic plane and of the secondary prismatic plane when exposed to vacuum was analyzed. We observe the formation of a thin liquid layer at the ice surface at temperatures below the melting point for all models and the three planes considered. For a given plane it was found that the thickness of a liquid layer was similar for different water models, when the comparison is made at the same undercooling with respect to the melting point of the model. The liquid layer thickness is found to increase with temperature. For a fixed temperature it was found that the thickness of the liquid layer decreases in the following order: the basal plane, the primary prismatic plane, and the secondary prismatic plane. For the TIP4P/Ice model, a model reproducing the experimental value of the melting temperature of ice, the first clear indication of the formation of a liquid layer appears at about -100 Celsius for the basal plane, at about -80 Celsius for the primary prismatic plane and at about -70 Celsius for the secondary prismatic plane.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,Theory of radio-frequency spectroscopy of impurities in quantum gases,"We present a theory of radio-frequency spectroscopy of impurities interacting with a quantum gas at finite temperature. By working in the canonical ensemble of a single impurity, we show that the impurity spectral response is directly connected to the finite-temperature equation of state (free energy) of the impurity. We consider two different response protocols: ""injection"", where the impurity is introduced into the medium from an initially non-interacting state; and ""ejection"", where the impurity is ejected from an initially interacting state with the medium. We show that there is a simple mapping between injection and ejection spectra, which is connected to the detailed balance condition in thermal equilibrium. To illustrate the power of our approach, we specialize to the case of the Fermi polaron, corresponding to an impurity atom that is immersed in a non-interacting Fermi gas. For a mobile impurity with a mass equal to the fermion mass, we employ a finite-temperature variational approach to obtain the impurity spectral response. We find a striking non-monotonic dependence on temperature in the impurity free energy, the contact, and the radio-frequency spectra. For the case of an infinitely heavy Fermi polaron, we derive exact results for the finite-temperature free energy, thus generalizing Fumi's theorem to arbitrary temperature. We also determine the exact dynamics of the contact after a quench of the impurity-fermion interactions. Finally, we show that the injection and ejection spectra obtained from the variational approach compare well with the exact spectra, thus demonstrating the accuracy of our approximate method.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,0
Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition,"We present a new algorithm, named Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition (AGD), for automatically decomposing spectra into Gaussian components. AGD uses derivative spectroscopy and machine learning to provide optimized guesses for the number of Gaussian components in the data, and also their locations, widths, and amplitudes. We test AGD and find that it produces results comparable to human-derived solutions on 21cm absorption spectra from the 21cm SPectral line Observations of Neutral Gas with the EVLA (21-SPONGE) survey. We use AGD with Monte Carlo methods to derive the HI line completeness as a function of peak optical depth and velocity width for the 21-SPONGE data, and also show that the results of AGD are stable against varying observational noise intensity. The autonomy and computational efficiency of the method over traditional manual Gaussian fits allow for truly unbiased comparisons between observations and simulations, and for the ability to scale up and interpret the very large data volumes from the upcoming Square Kilometer Array and pathfinder telescopes.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,The evidence of cosmic acceleration and observational constraints,"Directly comparing the 6 expansion rate measured by type Ia supernovae data and the lower bound on the expansion rate set by the strong energy conditions or the null hypothesis that there never exists cosmic acceleration, we see $3\sigma$ direct evidence of cosmic acceleration and the $Rh=ct$ model is strongly excluded by the type Ia supernovae data. We also use Gaussian process method to reconstruct the expansion rate and the deceleration parameter from the 31 cosmic chronometers data and the 6 data points on the expansion rate measured from type Ia supernoave data, the direct evidence of cosmic acceleration is more than $3\sigma$ and we find that the transition redshift $z_t=0.60_{-0.12}^{+0.21}$ at which the expansion of the Universe underwent the transition from acceleration to deceleration. The Hubble constant inferred from the cosmic chronometers data with the Gaussian process method is $H_0=67.46\pm4.75$ Km/s/Mpc. To understand the properties of cosmic acceleration and dark energy, we fit two different two-parameter models to the observational data, and we find that the constraints on the model parameters from either the full distance modulus data by the Pantheon compilation or the compressed expansion rate data are very similar, and the derived Hubble constants are consistent with the Planck 2018 result. Our results confirm that the 6 compressed expansion rate data can replace the full 1048 distance modulus data from the Pantheon compilation. We derive the transition redshift $z_t=0.61_{-0.16}^{+0.24}$ by fitting a simple $q(z)$ model to the combination of cosmic chronometers data and the Pantheon compilation, the result is consistent with that obtained from the reconstruction with Gaussian process.

The link between North Atlantic tropical cyclones and ENSO in seasonal forecasts,"This study assesses the ability of six European seasonal forecast models to simulate the observed teleconnection between ENSO and tropical cyclones (TCs) over the North Atlantic. While the models generally capture the basin-wide observed link, its magnitude is overestimated in all forecast models compared to reanalysis. Furthermore, the ENSO - TC relationship in the Caribbean is poorly simulated. It is shown that incorrect forecasting of wind shear appears to affect the representation of the teleconnection in some models, however it is not a completely sufficient explanation for the overestimation of the link.",physics,physics.ao-ph,UV Exposed Optical Fibers with Frequency Domain Reflectometry for Device Tracking in Intra-Arterial Procedures,"Shape tracking of medical devices using strain sensing properties in optical fibers has seen increased attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel guidance system for intra-arterial procedures using a distributed strain sensing device based on optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) to track the shape of a catheter. Tracking enhancement is provided by exposing a fiber triplet to a focused ultraviolet beam, producing high scattering properties. Contrary to typical quasi-distributed strain sensors, we propose a truly distributed strain sensing approach, which allows to reconstruct a fiber triplet in real-time. A 3D roadmap of the hepatic anatomy integrated with a 4D MR imaging sequence allows to navigate the catheter within the pre-interventional anatomy, and map the blood flow velocities in the arterial tree. We employed Riemannian anisotropic heat kernels to map the sensed data to the pre-interventional model. Experiments in synthetic phantoms and an in vivo model are presented. Results show that the tracking accuracy is suitable for interventional tracking applications, with a mean 3D shape reconstruction errors of 1.6 +/- 0.3 mm.

Penetrating probes: Jets and photons in a non-equilibrium quark-gluon plasma,We employ new field-theoretical tools to study photons and jets in a non-equilibrium quark-gluon plasma. Jet broadening and photon emission takes place through radiation which is suppressed by repeated and coherent interaction with the medium. We analyze this physics in an anisotropic plasma such as is created in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. The anisotropy introduces an angular dependence in radiation and reduces its overall rate. This can affect phenomenological predictions of the rapidity dependence and angular flow of jets and photons.,nucl,nucl-th,Neutral to charged kaon yield fluctuations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76TeV,"We present the first measurement of event-by-event fluctuations in the kaon sector in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt {s_{\rm NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The robust fluctuation correlator $\nu_{\rm dyn}$ is used to evaluate the magnitude of fluctuations of the relative yields of neutral and charged kaons, as well as the relative yields of charged kaons, as a function of collision centrality and selected kinematic ranges. While the correlator $\nu_{\rm dyn}[\rm K^+,\rm K^-]$ exhibits a scaling approximately in inverse proportion of the charged particle multiplicity, $\nu_{\rm dyn}[\rm K_S^0,\rm K^{\pm}]$ features a significant deviation from such scaling. Within uncertainties, the value of $\nu_{\rm dyn}[\rm K_S^0,\rm K^{\pm}]$ is independent of the selected transverse momentum interval, while it exhibits a pseudorapidity dependence. The results are compared with HIJING, AMPT and EPOS-LHC predictions, and are further discussed in the context of the possible production of disoriented chiral condensates in central Pb-Pb collisions.",nucl,nucl-ex,0
Matter wave Fourier optics with a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas,"We demonstrate and characterize an experimental technique to directly image the momentum distribution of a strongly interacting two-dimensional quantum gas with high momentum resolution. We apply the principles of Fourier optics to investigate three main operations on the expanding gas: focusing, collimation and magnification. We focus the gas in the radial plane using a harmonic confining potential and thus gain access to the momentum distribution. We pulse a different harmonic potential to stop the rapid axial expansion which allows us to image the momentum distribution with high resolution. Additionally, we propose a method to magnify the mapped momentum distribution to access interesting momentum scales.

Simulations were carried out to investigate the scaling properties of the push-relabel algorithm. The time evolution of the algorithm was studied along with the statistics of an auxiliary potential field. At very small random fields, the algorithm dynamics are closely related to the dynamics of two-species annihilation, consistent with fractal statistics for the distribution of minima in the potential (``height''). For $d=1,2$, a correlation length diverging at zero disorder sets a cutoff scale for the magnitude of the height field; our results are most consistent with a power-law correction to the exponential scaling of the correlation length with disorder in $d=2$. Near the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition in $d=3$, the time to find a solution diverges with a dynamic critical exponent of $z=0.93\pm0.06$ for a priority queue version and $z=0.43\pm0.06$ for a first-in first-out queue version of the algorithm. The links between the evolution of auxiliary fields in algorithmic time and the static physical properties of the RFIM ground state provide insight into the physics of the RFIM and a better understanding of how the algorithm functions.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,0
Analysis of the ECH effect on the EPM/AEs stability in Heliotron J plasma using a Landau closure model,"The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of the electron cyclotron heating (ECH) on the linear stability of Alfven Eigenmodes (AE) and energetic particle modes (EPM) triggered by energetic ions in Heliotron J plasma. The analysis is performed using the FAR3d code that solves a reduced MHD model to describe the thermal plasma coupled with a gyrofluid model for the energetic particles (EP) species. The simulations reproduce the AE/EPM stability trends observed in the experiments as the electron temperature (Te) increases, modifying the thermal plasma beta, EP beta and EP slowing down time. Particularly, the n/m=1/2 EPM and 2/4 Global AE (GAE) are stabilized in the low bumpiness (LB) configuration due to an enhancement of the continuum, Finite Larmor radius (FLR) and e-i Landau damping effects as the thermal beta increases. On the other hand, a larger ECH injection power cannot stabilize the AE/EPM in Medium (MB) and High bumpiness (HB) configurations because the damping effects are weaker compared to the LB case, unable to balance the further destabilization induced by an enhanced EP resonance as the EP slowing down time and EP beta increases with Te",physics,physics.plasm-ph,Access to mass rapid transit in OECD urban areas,"As mitigating car traffic in cities has become paramount to abate climate change effects, fostering public transport in cities appears ever-more appealing.

In this work, we clarify a universal definition of such a metrics, the ""People Near Transit (PNT)"", and present measures of this quantity for 85 urban areas in OECD countries, the largest dataset of such a quantity so far. By suggesting a standardized protocol, we make our dataset sound and expandable to other countries and cities in the world, which grounds our work into solid basis for multiple reuses in transport, environmental or economic studies.",physics,physics.soc-ph,0

Hidden Photons in connection to Dark Matter,"Light extra U(1) gauge bosons, so called hidden photons, which reside in a hidden sector have attracted much attention since they are a well motivated feature of many scenarios beyond the Standard Model and furthermore could mediate the interaction with hidden sector dark matter. We review limits on hidden photons from past electron beam dump experiments including two new limits from such experiments at KEK and Orsay. In addition, we study the possibility of having dark matter in the hidden sector. A simple toy model and different supersymmetric realisations are shown to provide viable dark matter candidates in the hidden sector that are in agreement with recent direct detection limits.",hep,hep-ph,Induced Universal Properties and Deconfinement,"We propose a general strategy to determine universal properties induced by a nearby phase transition on a non-order parameter field. A general renormalizable Lagrangian is used, which contains the order parameter and a non-order parameter field, and respects all the symmetries present. We investigate the case in which the order parameter field depends only on space coordinates and the case in which this field is also time dependent. We find that the spatial correlators of the non-order parameter field, in both cases, are infrared dominated and can be used to determine properties of the phase transition. We predict a universal behavior for the screening mass of a generic singlet field, and show how to extract relevant information from such a quantity. We also demonstrate that the pole mass of the non-order parameter field is not infrared sensitive. Our results can be applied to any continuous phase transition. As an example we consider the deconfining transition in pure Yang-Mills theory, and show that our findings are supported by lattice data. Our analysis suggests that monitoring the spatial correlators of different hadron species, more specifically the derivatives of these, provides an efficient and sufficient way to experimentally uncover the deconfining phase transition and its features.",hep,hep-lat,0
Data driven optimal filtering for phase and frequency of noisy oscillations: application to vortex flowmetering,"A new method for extracting the phase of oscillations from noisy time series is proposed. To obtain the phase, the signal is filtered in such a way that the filter output has minimal relative variation in the amplitude (MIRVA) over all filters with complex-valued impulse response. The argument of the filter output yields the phase. Implementation of the algorithm and interpretation of the result are discussed. We argue that the phase obtained by the proposed method has a low susceptibility to measurement noise and a low rate of artificial phase slips.

Charmed baryon resonances with heavy-quark spin symmetry,"Charmed baryon resonances that are generated dynamically are studied within a unitary baryon-meson coupled-channel model, which incorporates heavy-quark spin symmetry. The extension of the SU(3) Weinberg-Tomozawa chiral Lagrangian to SU(8) spin-flavor symmetry plus a suitable symmetry breaking is used. The model produces resonances with negative parity from s-wave interaction of pseudoscalar and vector mesons with $1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$ baryons.

We estimated atmospheric parameters for all stellar remnants based on the Gaia parallaxes and photometry. The high precision and completeness of the Gaia astrometry allowed us to search for wide binary companions. We re-identified all known binaries where both components have accurate DR2 astrometry, and established the binarity of one of the nine newly identified white dwarfs. No new companions were found to previously known 20 pc white dwarfs. Finally, we estimated the local white dwarf space-density to be $(4.49\pm0.38)\times10^{-3}$ pc$^{-3}$, having given careful consideration to the distance-dependent Gaia completeness, which misses known objects at short distances, but is close to complete for white dwarfs near 20 pc.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,0
Optimized evolution of networks for principal eigenvector localization,"Network science is increasingly being developed to get new insights about behavior and properties of complex systems represented in terms of nodes and interactions. One useful approach is investigating localization properties of eigenvectors having diverse applications including disease-spreading phenomena in underlying networks. In this work, we evolve an initial random network with an edge rewiring optimization technique considering the inverse participation ratio as a fitness function. The evolution process yields a network having localized principal eigenvector. We analyze various properties of the optimized networks and those obtained at the intermediate stage. Our investigations reveal the existence of few special structural features of such optimized networks including the presence of a set of edges which are necessary for the localization, and rewiring only one of them leads to a complete delocalization of the principal eigenvector. Our investigation reveals that PEV localization is not a consequence of a single network property, and preferably requires co-existence of various distinct structural as well as spectral features.",nlin,nlin.AO,Families of line-graphs and their quantization,Any directed graph G with N vertices and J edges has an associated line-graph L(G) where the J edges form the vertices of L(G).

We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a line-graph to be quantisable and demonstrate that the spectra of associated quantum propagators follow the predictions of random matrices under very general conditions.

Generation of intermediately-long sea waves by weakly sheared winds,"The present study concerns the numerical modeling of sea-wave instability under the effect of logarithmic-wind profile in hurricane conditions. The central point of the study is the calculation of the wave growth rate, which is proportional to the fractional input energy from the weakly-sheared (logarithmic) wind to the wave exponentially varying with time. It is shown for hurricane conditions that the Miles-type stability model based on the Charnock's formula with the standard constant coefficient underestimates the growth rate ~5 to 50 times as compared with the model employing the roughness adopted from experimental data for hurricane winds. The drag reduction with wind speed at hurricane conditions coupled with the similar behavior of the dimensionless gravity acceleration, leads to the minimum in the maximal growth rate and the maximum in the most unstable wavelength.",physics,physics.ao-ph,A versatile method to generate multiple types of micropatterns,"Micropatterning techniques have become an important tool for the study of cell behavior in controlled microenvironments. As a consequence, several approaches for the creation of micropatterns have been developed in recent years.

Hence, there is a need for patterning protocols that are flexible with regard to the materials used and compatible with different patterning strategies to create more elaborate setups. In this work, we present a versatile approach to micropatterning. The protocol is based on plasma treatment, protein coating, and a PLL-PEG backfill step, and produces homogeneous patterns on a variety of substrates. Protein density within the patterns can be controlled, and density gradients of surface-bound protein can be formed. Moreover, by combining the method with microcontact printing, it is possible to generate patterns composed of three different components within one iteration of the protocol.

The three families of basis sets agree very well with each other (0.01 kcal/mol RMS) when extrapolating from the two largest available basis sets: however, there are considerable differences in convergence behavior for the smaller basis sets. nZaPa-CV is superior for the core-core term and awCVnZ for the core-valence term. While the aug-cc-pwCV(T+d)Z basis set of Yockel and Wilson is superior to aug-cc-pwCVTZ, further extension of this family proved unproductive. The best compromise between accuracy and computational cost, in the context of high-accuracy computational thermochemistry methods such as W4 theory, is CCSD(T)/awCV{T,Q}Z, where the {T,Q} notation stands for extrapolation from the awCVTZ and awCVQZ basis set pair. For lower-cost calculations, a previously proposed combination of CCSD-F12b/cc-pCVTZ-F12 and CCSD(T)/pwCVTZ(no f) appears to 'give the best bang for the buck'. While core-valence correlation accounts for the lion's share of the inner shell contribution in first-row molecules, for second-row molecules core-core contributions may become important, particularly in systems like P4 and S4 with multiple adjacent second-row atoms.

A study on the effect of input data length on deep learning based magnitude classifier,"The rapid characterisation of earthquake parameters such as its magnitude is at the heart of Earthquake Early Warning (EEW). In traditional EEW methods the robustness in the estimation of earthquake parameters have been observed to increase with the length of input data. Since time is a crucial factor in EEW applications, in this paper we propose a deep learning based magnitude classifier and, further we investigate the effect of using five different durations of seismic waveform data after first P wave arrival of length 1s, 3s, 10s, 20s and 30s. This is accomplished by testing the performance of the proposed model that combines Convolution and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory units to classify waveforms based on their magnitude into three classes ""noise"", ""low magnitude events"" and ""high magnitude events"".

Interplay of inertia and deformability on rheological properties of a suspension of capsules,"The interplay of inertia and deformability has a substantial impact on the transport of soft particles suspended in a fluid. However, to date a thorough understanding of these systems is still missing and only a limited number of experimental and theoretical studies is available. We combine the finite-element, immersed-boundary and lattice-Boltzmann methods to simulate three-dimensional suspensions of soft particles subjected to planar Poiseuille flow at finite Reynolds numbers. Our findings confirm that the particle deformation and inclination increase when inertia is present. We observe that the Segr\'e-Silberberg effect is suppressed with respect to the particle deformability. Depending on the deformability and strength of inertial effects, inward or outward lateral migration of the particles takes place. In particular, for increasing Reynolds numbers and strongly deformable particles, a hitherto unreported distinct flow focusing effect emerges which is accompanied by a non-monotonic behaviour of the apparent suspension viscosity and thickness of the particle-free layer close to the channel walls. This effect can be explained by the behaviour of a single particle and the change of the particle collision mechanism when both deformability and inertia effects are relevant.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,"Anderson Transition and Generalized Lyapunov Exponents (comment on comment by P.Markos, L.Schweitzer and M.Weyrauch, cond-mat/0402068)","The generalized Lyapunov exponents describe the growth of the second moments for a particular solution of the quasi-1D Schroedinger equation with initial conditions on the left end.

We find that the anti-quark content is small at a low value of Q^2. Using these distributions as initial conditions for Q^2 evolution, we compare with experimental measurements of the structure function xF_3(x,Q^2) and find reasonable agreement.

We provide results on the determination of theta_13 from global data and discuss the dependence on the choice of reactor fluxes. We study in detail the statistical significance of a possible deviation of theta_23 from maximal mixing, the determination of its octant, the ordering of the mass states, and the sensitivity to the CP violating phase, and discuss the role of various complementary data sets in those respects.",hep,hep-ex,0
A multi-differential investigation of strangeness production in pp collisions with ALICE,"In these proceedings, two multi-differential analyses performed in pp collisions collected by the ALICE collaboration during the LHC Run 2 are presented. One investigates the dependence of strange particle production with multiplicity and effective energy, whereas the other clarifies how strangeness enhancement is correlated to the leading jet in the event. The results suggest that strangeness production at the LHC depends strongly on effective energy, and originates dominantly from the transverse region with respect to the leading jet direction.",nucl,nucl-ex,Microscopic Analysis of Nuclear Quantum Phase Transitions in the N=90 region,"The analysis of shape transitions in Nd isotopes, based on the framework of relativistic energy density functionals and restricted to axially symmetric shapes in Ref. \cite{PRL99}, is extended to the region $Z = 60$, 62, 64 with $N \approx 90$, and includes both $\beta$ and $\gamma$ deformations. Collective excitation spectra and transition probabilities are calculated starting from a five-dimensional Hamiltonian for quadrupole vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, with parameters determined by constrained self-consistent relativistic mean-field calculations for triaxial shapes. The results reproduce available data, and show that there is an abrupt change of structure at N=90 that can be approximately characterized by the X(5) analytic solution at the critical point of the first-order quantum phase transition between spherical and axially deformed shapes.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Near-threshold properties of the electronic density of layered quantum-dots,"We present a way to manipulate an electron trapped in a layered quantum dot based on near-threshold properties of one-body potentials. We show that potentials with a simple global parameter allows the manipulation of the wave function changing its spatial extent. This phenomenon seems to be fairly general and could be implemented using current quantum-dot quantum wells technologies and materials if a proper layered quantum dot is designed. The layered quantum dot under consideration is similar to a quantum-dot quantum well device, i.e. consists of a spherical core surrounded by successive layers of different materials. The number of layers and the constituent material are chosen to highlight the near-threshold properties. In particular we show that the near-threshold phenomena can be observed using an effective mass approximation model that describes the layered quantum dot which is consistent with actual experimental parameters.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Effective elastic moduli of composites with a strongly disordered host material,"The local elastic properties of strongly disordered host material are investigated using the theory of correlated random matrices. A significant increase in stiffness is shown in the interfacial region, which thickness depends on the strength of disorder. It is shown that this effect plays a crucial role in nanocomposites, in which interfacial regions are formed around each nanoparticle. The studied interfacial effect can significantly increase the influence of nanoparticles on the macroscopic stiffness of nanocomposites. The obtained thickness of the interfacial region is determined by the heterogeneity length scale and is of the same order as the length scale of the boson peak.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,0
Measurement of the Negative Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment to 0.7 ppm,"The anomalous magnetic moment of the negative muon has been measured to a precision of 0.7 parts per million (ppm) at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron.

The result a_mu= 11 659 214(8)(3) \times 10^{-10} (0.7 ppm), where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is sytematic, is consistend with previous measurements of the anomaly for the positive and negative muon.

We find that several of our Landen transformations have a rather different and substantially more elegant appearance compared to the forms usually found in the literature. Further, by making use of the cyclic identities discovered recently, we also obtain some entirely new sets of Landen transformations. This paper is an expanded and revised version of our previous paper math-ph/0204054.",hep,hep-th,0
Lower-Critical Spin-Glass Dimension from 23 Sequenced Hierarchical Models,"The lower-critical dimension for the existence of the Ising spin-glass phase is calculated, numerically exactly, as $d_L = 2.520$ for a family of hierarchical lattices, from an essentially exact (correlation coefficent $R^2 = 0.999999$) near-linear fit to 23 different diminishing fractional dimensions. To obtain this result, the phase transition temperature between the disordered and spin-glass phases, the corresponding critical exponent $y_T$, and the runaway exponent $y_R$ of the spin-glass phase are calculated for consecutive hierarchical lattices as dimension is lowered.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Theory of shift heat current and its application to electron-phonon coupled systems,"We propose a heat current analog of the shift current, ""shift heat current"". We study nonlinear heat current responses to an applied ac electric field by a diagrammatic method and derive a microscopic expression for the second order dc heat current response. As a result, we find that the shift heat current is related to the shift vector, a geometric quantity that also appears in the expression for the shift current. The shift heat current directly depends on and can be controlled through the chemical potential. In addition, we apply the diagrammatic method to electron-phonon coupled systems, and we find that even if only the phonons are excited by an external field, the amplitude of the shift heat current is determined by the energy scale of electrons, not of phonons.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,0
Evidence for the Jacobi shape transition in hot 46Ti,"The gamma-rays from the decay of the GDR in 46Ti compound nucleus formed in the 18O+28Si reaction at bombarding energy 105 MeV have been measured in an experiment using a setup consisting of the combined EUROBALL IV, HECTOR and EUCLIDES arrays. A comparison of the extracted GDR lineshape data with the predictions of the thermal shape fluctuation model shows evidence for the Jacobi shape transition in hot 46Ti. In addition to the previously found broad structure in the GDR lineshape region at 18-27 MeV caused by large deformations, the presence of a low energy component (around 10 MeV), due to the Coriolis splitting in prolate well deformed shape, has been identified for the first time.",nucl,nucl-ex,Heavy quark fragmentation functions at next-to-leading perturbative QCD,"It is well-known that the dominant mechanism to produce hadronic bound states with large transverse momentum is fragmentation. This mechanism is described by the fragmentation functions (FFs) which are the universal and process-independent functions. Here, we review the perturbative FFs formalism as an appropriate tool for studying these hadronization processes and detail the extension of this formalism at next-to-leading order (NLO). Using the Suzuki's model, we calculate the perturbative QCD FF for a heavy quark to fragment into a S-wave heavy meson at NLO. As an example, we study the LO and NLO FFs for a charm quark to split into the S-wave $D$-meson and compare our analytic results both with experimental data and well-known phenomenological models.",nucl,nucl-th,0
The effect of a small magnetic flux on the metal-insulator transition,"We numerically show that very small magnetic flux can significantly shift the metal-insulator transition point in a disordered electronic system. The shift we observe for the 3d Anderson model obeys a power law as predicted by Larkin and Khmel'nitskii (1981). We compute the exponent and find good agreement with the prediction. However, the power law holds only for much smaller magnetic fields than has been previously assumed, and is accompanied by a large prefactor, leading to a surprising strong dependence of the transition point on the applied magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that the critical level-spacing distribution is identical in the presence and absence of a magnetic field if hard-wall boundary conditions are applied. This result is surprising since both cases belong to different universality classes and different distributions have been reported for periodic boundary conditions.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Local photodoping in monolayer MoS2,"Inducing electrostatic doping in 2D materials by laser exposure (photodoping effect) is an exciting route to tune optoelectronic phenomena. However, there is a lack of investigation concerning in what respect the action of photodoping in optoelectronic devices is local. Here, we employ scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) techniques to investigate how a permanent photodoping modulates the photocurrent generation in MoS2 transistors locally. We claim that the photodoping fills the electronic states in MoS2 conduction band, preventing the photon-absorption and the photocurrent generation by the MoS2 sheet. Moreover, by comparing the persistent photocurrent (PPC) generation of MoS2 on top of different substrates, we elucidate that the interface between the material used for the gate and the insulator (gate-insulator interface) is essential for the photodoping generation. Our work gives a step forward to the understanding of the photodoping effect in MoS2 transistors and the implementation of such an effect in integrated devices.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,0
Roton in a few-body dipolar system,"We solve numerically exactly the many-body 1D model of bosons interacting via short-range and dipolar forces and moving in the box with periodic boundary conditions. We show that the lowest energy states with fixed total momentum can be smoothly transformed from the typical states of collective character to states resembling single particle excitations. In particular, we identify the celebrated roton state. The smooth transition is realized by simultaneous tuning short-range interactions and adjusting a trap geometry.

Longitudinal and transverse meson correlators in the deconfined phase from the lattice,"It has long been known that QCD undergoes a deconfining phase transition at high temperature.

The operators are perturbatively renormalized including corrections of O(\alpha_s/am_Q). We examine scaling behavior of the B-parameters in detail, and discuss the systematic uncertainties using scatter of results with different analysis procedures adopted. As a result, we find B_{B_d}(m_b)=0.84(2)(8), B_{B_s}/B_{B_d}=1.017(10)(^{+4}_{-0}) and B_{S_s}(m_b)=0.87(1)(9)(^{+1}_{-0}) in the quenched approximation.",hep,hep-lat,"TeV Scale Leptogenesis, theta_13 And Doubly Charged Particles At LHC","We explore a realistic supersymmetric SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_B-L model spontaneously broken at around 10^12 GeV.

Deep learning of systematic sea ice model errors from data assimilation increments,"Data assimilation is often viewed as a framework for correcting short-term error growth in dynamical climate model forecasts. When viewed on the time scales of climate however, these short-term corrections, or analysis increments, can closely mirror the systematic bias patterns of the dynamical model. In this study, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn a mapping from model state variables to analysis increments, in order to showcase the feasibility of a data-driven model parameterization which can predict state-dependent model errors. We undertake this problem using an ice-ocean data assimilation system within the Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system Research (SPEAR) model, developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, which assimilates satellite observations of sea ice concentration every 5 days between 1982--2017. The CNN then takes inputs of data assimilation forecast states and tendencies, and makes predictions of the corresponding sea ice concentration increments. Specifically, the inputs are states and tendencies of sea ice concentration, sea-surface temperature, ice velocities, ice thickness, net shortwave radiation, ice-surface skin temperature, sea-surface salinity, as well as a land-sea mask. We find the CNN is able to make skillful predictions of the increments in both the Arctic and Antarctic and across all seasons, with skill that consistently exceeds that of a climatological increment prediction. This suggests that the CNN could be used to reduce sea ice biases in free-running SPEAR simulations, either as a sea ice parameterization or an online bias correction tool for numerical sea ice forecasts.",physics,physics.ao-ph,Simultaneous Imaging of Widely Differing Particle Concentrations in MPI: Problem Statement and Algorithmic Proposal for Improvement,"Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging technique for determining the spatial distribution of superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Current MPI systems are capable of imaging iron masses over a wide dynamic range of more than four orders of magnitude. In theory, this range could be further increased using adaptive amplifiers, which prevent signal clipping. While this applies to a single sample, the dynamic range is severely limited if several samples with different concentrations or strongly inhomogeneous particle distributions are considered. One scenario that occurs quite frequently in pre-clinical applications is that a highly concentrated tracer bolus in the vascular system ""shadows"" nearby organs with lower effective tracer concentrations. The root cause of the problem is the ill-posedness of the MPI imaging operator, which requires regularization for stable reconstruction. In this work, we introduce a simple two-step algorithm that increases the dynamic range by a factor of four. Furthermore, the algorithm enables spatially adaptive regularization, i.e. highly concentrated signals can be reconstructed with maximum spatial resolution, while low concentrated signals are strongly regularized to prevent noise amplification.",physics,physics.med-ph,0
"3D two-point ray tracing for heterogeneous, weakly transversely-isotropic media","A two-point ray-tracing technique for 3D smoothly heterogeneous, weakly transversely-isotropic media is based on Fermat's principle and takes advantage of global Chebyshev approximation of both the model and curved rays. This approximation gives explicit derivatives of traveltimes with respect to ray parameters and allows one to use the rapidly converging conjugate gradient method to compute traveltimes. The method is fast because, for smoothly heterogeneous media, approximation of rays by only a few polynomials and a few conjugate gradient iterations provide excellent precision of traveltime calculation.",physics,physics.geo-ph,A model for codon position bias in RNA editing,"RNA editing can be crucial for the expression of genetic information via inserting, deleting, or substituting a few nucleotides at specific positions in an RNA sequence. Within coding regions in an RNA sequence, editing usually occurs with a certain bias in choosing the positions of the editing sites. In the mitochondrial genes of {\it Physarum polycephalum}, many more editing events have been observed at the third codon position than at the first and second, while in some plant mitochondria the second codon position dominates. Here we propose an evolutionary model that explains this bias as the basis of selection at the protein level. The model predicts a distribution of the three positions rather close to the experimental observation in {\it Physarum}. This suggests that the codon position bias in {\it Physarum} is mainly a consequence of selection at the protein level.",physics,physics.bio-ph,0
Persistent spin helix in Rashba-Dresselhaus two-dimensional electron systems,"A persistent spin helix (PSH) in spin-orbit-coupled two-dimensional electron systems was recently predicted to exist in two cases: [001] quantum wells (QWs) with equal coupling strengths of the Rashba and the Dresselhaus interactions (RD), and Dresselhaus-only [110] QWs. Here we present supporting results and further investigations, using our previous results [Phys. Rev. B 72, 153305 (2005)]. Refined PSH patterns for both RD [001] and Dresselhaus [110] QWs are shown, such that the feature of the helix is clearly seen. We also discuss the time dependence of spin to reexamine the origin of the predicted persistence of the PSH. For the RD [001] case, we further take into account the random Rashba effect, which is much more realistic than the constant Rashba model. The distorted PSH pattern thus obtained suggests that such a PSH may be more observable in the Dresselhaus [110] QWs, if the dopants cannot be regularly enough distributed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,Unveiling the Structural Origin of the High Carrier Mobility of a Molecular Monolayer on Boron Nitride,"Very recently, it was demonstrated that the carrier mobility of a molecular monolayer dioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene (C8-BTBT) on boron nitride can reach 10 cm2/Vs, the highest among the previously reported monolayer molecular field-effect transistors. Here we show that the high-quality single crystal of the C8-BTBT monolayer may be the key origin of the record-high carrier mobility. We discover that the C8-BTBT molecules prefer layer-by-layer growth on both hexagonal boron nitride and graphene. The flatness of these substrates substantially decreases the C8-BTBT nucleation density and enables repeatable growth of large-area single crystal of the C8-BTBT monolayer. Our experimental result indicates that only out-of-plane roughness greater than 0.6 nm of the substrates could induce disturbance in the crystal growth and consequently affect the charge transport. This information would be important in guiding the growth of high-quality epitaxy molecular film.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,0
Time Dependent Inelastic Emission and Capture of Localized Electrons in Si n-MOSFETs Under Microwave Irradiation,"Microwave irradiation causes voltage fluctuations in solid state nanodevices. Such an effect is relevant in atomic electronics and nanostructures for quantum information processing, where charge or spin states are controlled by microwave fields and electrically detected. Here the variation of the characteristic times of the multiphonon capture and emission of a single electron by an interface defect in submicron MOSFETs is calculated and measured as a function of the microwave power, whose frequency of the voltage modulation is assumed to be large if compared to the inverse of the characteristic times. The variation of the characteristic times under microwave irradiation is quantitatively predicted from the microwave frequency dependent stationary current generated by the voltage fluctuations itself. The expected values agree with the experimental measurements. The coupling between the microwave field and either one or two terminals of the device is discussed. Some consequences on nanoscale device technology are drawn.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,A topological method to characterize tapped granular media from the position of the particles,"We use the first Betti number of a complex to characterize the morphological structure of granular samples in mechanical equilibrium. We analyze two-dimensional granular packings after a tapping process by means of both simulations and experiments. States with equal packing fraction obtained with different tapping intensities are distinguished after the introduction of a filtration parameter which determines the particles (nodes in the network) that are joined by an edge. We first use numerical simulations to characterize the effect of the precision in the particles localization by artificially adding different levels of noise in this magnitude. The outcomes obtained for the simulations are then compared with the experimental results allowing a clear distinction of experimental packings that have the same density. This is accomplished by just using the position of the particles and no other information about the possible contacts, or magnitude of forces.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,0
Doubly coupled matter fields in massive bigravity,"In the context of massive (bi-)gravity non-minimal matter couplings have been proposed. These couplings are special in the sense that they are free of the Boulware-Deser ghost below the strong coupling scale and can be used consistently as an effective field theory. Furthermore, they enrich the phenomenology of massive gravity. We consider these couplings in the framework of bimetric gravity and study the cosmological implications for background and linear tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations.

In this paper, we report on the results of our observations focusing on optical/near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy. The maximum V-band magnitude of SN 2020uem is over $-19.5$ mag. The light curves decline slowly with a rate of $\sim 0.75 {\rm ~mag}/100 {\rm ~days}$. In the late phase ($\gtrsim 300$ days), the light curves show accelerated decay ($\sim 1.2 {\rm ~mag}/100 {\rm ~days}$). The optical spectra show prominent hydrogen emission lines and broad features possibly associated with Fe-peak elements. In addition, the $\rm H\alpha$ profile exhibits a narrow P-Cygni profile with the absorption minimum of $\sim 100 {\rm ~km~s^{-1}}$. SN 2020uem shows a higher $\rm H\alpha/H\beta$ ratio ($\sim 7$) than those of SNe IIn, which suggests a denser CSM. The NIR spectrum shows the Paschen and Brackett series with continuum excess in the H and Ks bands. We conclude that the NIR excess emission originates from newly-formed carbon dust. The dust mass ($M_{\rm d}$) and temperature ($T_{\rm d}$) are derived to be $(M_{\rm d}, T_{\rm d}) \sim (4-7 \times 10^{-5} {\rm ~M_{\odot}}, 1500-1600 {\rm ~K})$. We discuss the differences and similarities between the observational properties of SNe IIn/Ia-CSM and those of other SNe Ia and interacting SNe. In particular, spectral features around $\sim 4650$ {\text \AA} and $\sim 5900$ {\text \AA} of SNe IIn/Ia-CSM are more suppressed than those of SNe Ia; these lines are possibly contributed, at least partly, by \ion{Mg}{1}] and \ion{Na}{1}, and may be suppressed by high ionization behind the reverse shock caused by the massive CSM.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,0
Probing Dynamics at Interfaces: Molecular Motions in Lipid Bilayers studied by Neutron Backscattering,"Lipid membranes in a physiological context cannot be understood without taking into account their mobile environment.

This technique allows discriminating the Q-dependent onset of mobility and provides a benchmark test regarding the feasibility of dynamical neutron scattering investigations on these sample systems.

The freezing is lowered several degrees as compared to (heavy) bulk water.",physics,physics.bio-ph,Towards the Probabilistic Earth-System Model,"Multi-model ensembles provide a pragmatic approach to the representation of model uncertainty in climate prediction. However, such representations are inherently ad hoc, and, as shown, probability distributions of climate variables based on current-generation multi-model ensembles, are not accurate. Results from seasonal re-forecast studies suggest that climate model ensembles based on stochastic-dynamic parametrisation are beginning to outperform multi-model ensembles, and have the potential to become significantly more skilful than multi-model ensembles. The case is made for stochastic representations of model uncertainty in future-generation climate prediction models. Firstly, a guiding characteristic of the scientific method is an ability to characterise and predict uncertainty; individual climate models are not currently able to do this. Secondly, through the effects of noise-induced rectification, stochastic-dynamic parametrisation may provide a (poor man's) surrogate to high resolution. Thirdly, stochastic-dynamic parametrisations may be able to take advantage of the inherent stochasticity of electron flow through certain types of low-energy computer chips, currently under development. These arguments have particular resonance for next-generation Earth-System models, which purport to be comprehensive numerical representations of climate, and where integrations at high resolution may be unaffordable.",physics,physics.ao-ph,0
Medium Dependence of the Vector-Meson Mass: Dynamical and/or Brown-Rho Scaling?,"We discuss the similarities and differences for the theories of Rapp, Wambach and collaborators (called R/W in short) and those based on Brown-Rho scaling (called B/R), as applied to reproduce the dileptons measured by the CERES collaboration in the CERN experiments. In both theories the large number of dileptons at invariant masses $\sim$~$m_\rho/2$ are shown to be chiefly produced by a density-dependent $\rho$-meson mass. In R/W the medium dependence is dynamically calculated using hadronic variables defined in the matter-free vacuum. In B/R scaling it follows from movement towards chiral symmetry restoration due to medium-induced vacuum change, and is described in terms of constituent (or quasiparticle) quarks. We argue that the R/W description should be reliable up to densities somewhat beyond nuclear density, where hadrons are the effective variables. At higher density there should be a crossover to constituent quarks as effective variables scaling according to B/R. In the crossover region, the two descriptions must be ``dual''.",nucl,nucl-th,Resonance-like coherent production of a pion pair in the reaction $pd \rightarrow pd\pi\pi$ in the GeV region,"The reaction $p + d \rightarrow p + d + X$ was studied at 0.8-2.0 GeV proton beam energies with the ANKE magnetic spectrometer at the COSY synchrotron storage ring. The proton-deuteron pairs emerging with high momenta, 0.6-1.8 GeV/$c$, were detected at small angles with respect to the proton beam. Distribution over the reaction missing mass $M_x$ reveals a local enhancement near the threshold of the pion pair production specific for the so-called ABC effect. The enhancement has a structure of a narrow bump placed above a smooth continuum. The invariant mass of the $d\pi\pi$ system in this enhancement region exhibits a resonance-like peak at $M_{d\pi\pi} \approx 2.36$ GeV/$c^2$ with the width $\Gamma \approx 0.10$ GeV/$c^2$.

Low-ionization galaxies and evolution in a pilot survey up to z = 1,"We present galaxy spectroscopic data on a pencil beam of $10.75' \times7.5'$ centered on the X-ray cluster RXJ0054.0-2823 at $z = 0.29$. We study the spectral evolution of galaxies from $z=1$ down to the cluster redshift in a magnitude-limited sample at $\rm R\leq23$, for which the statistical properties of the sample are well understood. We divide emission-line galaxies in star-forming galaxies, LINERs, and Seyferts by using emission-line ratios of [OII], $\rm H\beta$, and [OIII], and derive stellar fractions from population synthesis models. We focus our analysis on absorption and low-ionization galaxies. For absorption-line galaxies we recover the well known result that these galaxies have had no detectable evolution since $z\sim0.6-0.7$, but we also find that in the range $z=0.65-1$ at least 50% of the stars in bright absorption systems are younger than 2.5Gyr. Faint absorption-line galaxies in the cluster at $z = 0.29$ also had significant star formation during the previous 2-3Gyr, while their brighter counterparts seem to be composed only of old stars. At $z\sim0.8$, our dynamically young cluster had a truncated red-sequence. This result seems to be consistent with a scenario where the final assembly of E/S0 took place at $z<1$. In the volume-limited range $0.35\leq z\leq0.65$ we find that 23% of the early-type galaxies have LINER-like spectra with $\rm H\beta$ in absorption and a significant component of A stars. The vast majority of LINERs in our sample have significant populations of young and intermediate-aged stars and are thus not related to AGN, but to the population of `retired galaxies' recently identified by Cid-Fernandes et al.

Early-type LINERs with various fractions of A stars, and E+A galaxies appear to play an important role in the formation of the red sequence.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Gaseous Mean Opacities for Giant Planet and Ultracool Dwarf Atmospheres over a Range of Metallicities and Temperatures,"We present new calculations of Rosseland and Planck gaseous mean opacities relevant to the atmospheres of giant planets and ultracool dwarfs. Such calculations are used in modeling the atmospheres, interiors, formation, and evolution of these objects. Our calculations are an expansion of those presented in Freedman et al. (2008) to include lower pressures, finer temperature resolution, and also the higher metallicities most relevant for giant planet atmospheres. Calculations span 1 microbar to 300 bar, and 75 K to 4000 K, in a nearly square grid. Opacities at metallicities from solar to 50 times solar abundances are calculated. We also provide an analytic fit to the Rosseland mean opacities over the grid in pressure, temperature, and metallicity. In addition to computing mean opacities at these local temperatures, we also calculate them with weighting functions up to 7000 K, to simulate the mean opacities for incident stellar intensities, rather than locally thermally emitted intensities. The chemical equilibrium calculations account for the settling of condensates in a gravitational field and are applicable to cloud-free giant planet and ultracool dwarf atmospheres, but not circumstellar disks.

Applying Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process Regression to Computational Fluid Dynamics Problems,"Bayesian optimization (BO) based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) is applied to different CFD (computational fluid dynamics) problems which can be of practical relevance. The problems are i) shape optimization in a lid-driven cavity to minimize or maximize the energy dissipation, ii) shape optimization of the wall of a channel flow in order to obtain a desired pressure-gradient distribution along the edge of the turbulent boundary layer formed on the other wall, and finally, iii) optimization of the controlling parameters of a spoiler-ice model to attain the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil with an actual surface ice. The diversity of the optimization problems, independence of the optimization approach from any adjoint information, the ease of employing different CFD solvers in the optimization loop, and more importantly, the relatively small number of the required flow simulations reveal the flexibility, efficiency, and versatility of the BO-GPR approach in CFD applications. It is shown that to ensure finding the global optimum of the design parameters of the size up to 8, less than 90 executions of the CFD solvers are needed. Furthermore, it is observed that the number of flow simulations does not significantly increase with the number of design parameters. The associated computational cost of these simulations can be affordable for many optimization cases with practical relevance.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,Cosmic-muon characterization and annual modulation measurement with Double Chooz detectors,"A study on cosmic muons has been performed for the two identical near and far neutrino detectors of the Double Chooz experiment, placed at $\sim$120 and $\sim$300 m.w.e. underground respectively, including the corresponding simulations using the MUSIC simulation package. This characterization has allowed to measure the muon flux reaching both detectors to be (3.64 $\pm$ 0.04) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for the near detector and (7.00 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for the far one. The seasonal modulation of the signal has also been studied observing a positive correlation with the atmospheric temperature, leading to an effective temperature coefficient of $\alpha_{T}$ = 0.212 $\pm$ 0.024 and 0.355 $\pm$ 0.019 for the near and far detectors respectively. These measurements, in good agreement with expectations based on theoretical models, represent one of the first measurements of this coefficient in shallow depth installations.",physics,physics.ins-det,0
Effects of the environment on the multiplicity properties of stars in the STARFORGE simulations,"Most observed stars are part of a multiple star system, but the formation of such systems and the role of environment and various physical processes is still poorly understood. We present a suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star-forming molecular clouds from the STARFORGE project that include stellar feedback with varied initial surface density, magnetic fields, level of turbulence, metallicity, interstellar radiation field, simulation geometry and turbulent driving. In our fiducial cloud the raw simulation data reproduces the observed multiplicity fractions for Solar-type and higher mass stars, similar to previous works. However, after correcting for observational incompleteness the simulation under-predicts these values. The discrepancy is likely due to the lack of disk fragmentation, as the simulation only resolves multiples that form either through capture or core fragmentation. The raw mass distribution of companions is consistent with randomly drawing from the initial mass function for the companions of $>1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stars, however, accounting for observational incompleteness produces a flatter distribution similar to observations. We show that stellar multiplicity changes as the cloud evolves and anti-correlates with stellar density. This relationship also explains most multiplicity variations between runs, i.e., variations in the initial conditions that increase stellar density (increased surface density, reduced turbulence) decrease multiplicity. While other parameters, such as metallicity, interstellar radiation, and geometry significantly affect the star formation history or the IMF, varying them produces no clear trend in stellar multiplicity properties.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Gravitational Wave Statistics for Pulsar Timing Arrays: Examining Bias from Using a Finite Number of Pulsars,"Recently, many different pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported strong evidence for a common stochastic process in their data sets. The reported amplitudes are in tension with previously computed upper limits. In this paper, we investigate how using a subset of a set of pulsars biases Bayesian upper limit recovery. We generate 500 simulated PTA data sets based on the NANOGrav 11-year data set with an injected stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We then compute upper limits by sampling individual pulsar likelihoods, and combine them through a factorized version of the PTA likelihood to obtain upper limits on the GWB amplitude using different numbers of pulsars. We find that it is possible to recover an upper limit (95\% credible interval) \textit{below} the injected value, and that it is significantly more likely for this to occur when using a subset of pulsars to compute the upper limit. When picking pulsars to induce the maximum possible bias, we find that the 95\% Bayesian upper limit recovered is below the injected value in 10.6\% (53 of 500) of realizations. Further, we find that if we choose a subset of pulsars in order to obtain a lower upper limit than when using the full set of pulsars, the distribution of upper limits obtained from these 500 realizations is shifted to lower amplitude values.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,0

The energy source responsible for accelerating the plasma to high speeds is widely debated, however there is evidence that it is ultimately magnetic in nature with candidate mechanisms including wave heating^(1,2) and interchange reconnection^(3,4,5). The coronal magnetic field near the solar surface is structured on scales associated with supergranulation convection cells, where descending flows create intense fields. The energy density in these network magnetic field bundles is a likely candidate as an energy source of the wind. Here we report measurements of fast solar wind streams from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft^6 which provides strong evidence for the interchange reconnection mechanism. We show that supergranulation structure at the coronal hole base remains imprinted in the near-Sun solar wind resulting in asymmetric patches of magnetic 'switchbacks'^(7,8) and bursty wind streams with power law-like energetic ion spectra to beyond 100 keV. Computer simulations of interchange reconnection support key features of the observations, including the ion spectra. Important characteristics of interchange reconnection in the low corona are inferred from the data including that the reconnection is collisionless and that the energy release rate is sufficient to power the fast wind. In this scenario, open magnetic flux undergoes continuous reconnection and the wind is driven both by the resulting plasma pressure and the radial Alfvenic flow bursts.",physics,physics.space-ph,0
Spectroscopic visualization of flat bands in magic-angle twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene: localization-delocalization coexisting electronic states,"Recent transport studies have demonstrated the great potential of twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a new platform to host moir\'e flat bands with a higher tunability than twisted bilayer graphene (tBG). However, a direct visualization of the flat bands in tMBG and its comparison with the ones in tBG remain unexplored. Here, via fabricating on a single sample with exactly the same twist angle of ~1.13{\deg}, we present a direct comparative study between tMBG and tBG using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. We observe a sharp density of states peak near the Fermi energy in tunneling spectroscopy, confirming unambiguously the existence of flat electronic bands in tMBG. The bandwidth of this flat-band peak is found to be slightly narrower than that of the tBG, validating previous theoretical predictions. Remarkably, by measuring spatially resolved spectroscopy, combined with continuum model calculation, we show that the flat-band states in tMBG exhibit a unique layer-resolved localization-delocalization coexisting feature, which offers an unprecedented possibility to utilize their cooperation on exploring novel correlation phenomena. Our work provides important microscopic insight of flat-band states for better understanding the emergent physics in graphene moir\'e systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Realization of a single Josephson junction for Bose-Einstein condensates,We report on the realization of a double-well potential for Rubidium-87 Bose-Einstein condensates.

On this basis, the temperature dependence of the spatial quark and diquark string tensions is predicted.

Rotational effects on the negative magnetic pressure instability,"The surface layers of the Sun are strongly stratified. In the presence of turbulence with a weak mean magnetic field, a large-scale instability resulting in the formation of non-uniform magnetic structures, can be excited over the scale of many turbulent eddies or convection cells. This instability is caused by a negative contribution of turbulence to the effective (mean-field) magnetic pressure and has previously been discussed in connection with the formation of active regions and perhaps sunspots. We want to understand the effects of rotation on this instability in both two and three dimensions. We use mean-field magnetohydrodynamics in a parameter regime in which the properties of the negative effective magnetic pressure instability have previously been found to be in agreement with those of direct numerical simulations. We find that the instability is suppressed already for relatively slow rotation with Coriolis numbers (i.e. inverse Rossby numbers) around 0.2. The suppression is strongest at the equator. In the nonlinear regime, we find traveling wave solutions with propagation in the prograde direction at the equator with additional poleward migration away from the equator. The prograde rotation of the magnetic pattern near the equator is argued to be a possible explanation for the faster rotation speed of magnetic tracers found on the Sun.

In addition to accretion, the effect of these two principles acting concurrently could be significant and the transition between those two has not been extensively studied and quantified in the literature yet. In order to contribute to the understanding of disk winds, we present the phenomena emerging in the framework of two-dimensional axisymmetric, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations including EUV-/ X-ray driven photoevaporation. Of particular interest are the examination of the transition region between photoevaporation and magnetically driven wind, the possibility of emerging magneto-centrifugal wind effects, as well as the morphology of the wind itself depending on the strength of the magnetic field. We use the PLUTO code in a 2.5D axisymmetric configuration with additional treatment of EUV-/ X-ray heating and dynamic ohmic diffusion based on a semi-analytical chemical model. We identify the transition between both outflow types to occur for values of the initial plasma beta $\beta \geq 10^7$, while magnetically driven winds generally outperform photoevaporation for stronger fields. In our simulations we observe irregular and asymmetric outflows for stronger magnetic fields. In the weak field regime the photoevaporation rates are slightly lowered by perturbations of the gas density in the inner regions of the disk. Overall, our results predict a wind with a lever arm smaller than 1.5, consistent with a hot magneto-thermal wind. Stronger accretion flows are present for values of $\beta < 10^7$.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,0

Heavy quark fragmentation functions at next-to-leading perturbative QCD,"It is well-known that the dominant mechanism to produce hadronic bound states with large transverse momentum is fragmentation. This mechanism is described by the fragmentation functions (FFs) which are the universal and process-independent functions. Here, we review the perturbative FFs formalism as an appropriate tool for studying these hadronization processes and detail the extension of this formalism at next-to-leading order (NLO). Using the Suzuki's model, we calculate the perturbative QCD FF for a heavy quark to fragment into a S-wave heavy meson at NLO. As an example, we study the LO and NLO FFs for a charm quark to split into the S-wave $D$-meson and compare our analytic results both with experimental data and well-known phenomenological models.",hep,hep-ph,Orbifold resolutions with general profile,"A very general class of resolved versions of the C/Z_N, T^2/Z_N and S^1/Z_2 orbifolds is considered and the free theory of 6D chiral fermions studied on it.

Dopant Precursor Adsorption into Single-Dimer Windows: Towards Guided Self-Assembly of Dopant Arrays on Si(100),"Atomically precise dopant arrays in Si are being pursued for solid-state quantum computing applications.

We leverage the self-assembled c(4x2) structure formed on Br- and I-Si(100) and investigate molecular precursor adsorption into the generated array of single-dimer window (SDW) adsorption sites with density functional theory (DFT). The adsorption of several technologically relevant dopant precursors (PH$_3$, BCl$_3$, AlCl$_3$, GaCl$_3$) into SDWs formed with various resists (H, Cl, Br, I) are explored to identify the effects of steric interactions. PH$_3$ adsorbed without barrier on all resists studied, while BCl$_3$ exhibited the largest adsorption barrier, 0.34 eV, with an I resist.

Supermassive black hole spin evolution in cosmological simulations with OpenGadget3,"Mass and spin of massive black holes (BHs) at the centre of galaxies evolve due to gas accretion and mergers with other BHs. Besides affecting e.g. the evolution of relativistic jets, the BH spin determines the efficiency with which the BH radiates energy. Using cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the evolution of the BH spin across cosmic time and its role in controlling the joint growth of supermassive BHs and their host galaxies. We implement a sub-resolution prescription that models the BH spin, accounting for both BH coalescence and misaligned accretion through a geometrically thin, optically thick disc. We investigate how BH spin evolves in two idealised setups, in zoomed-in simulations, and in a cosmological volume. The latter simulation allows us to retrieve statistically robust results as for the evolution and distribution of BH spins as a function of BH properties. We find that BHs with $M_{\rm BH}\lesssim 2 \times 10^{7}\;{\rm M}_{\odot}$ grow through gas accretion, occurring mostly in a coherent fashion that favours spin-up. Above $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 2 \times 10^{7}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ the gas angular momentum directions of subsequent accretion episodes are often uncorrelated with each other. The probability of counter-rotating accretion and hence spin-down increases with BH mass. In the latter mass regime, BH coalescence plays an important role. The spin magnitude displays a wide variety of histories, depending on the dynamical state of the gas feeding the BH and the relative contribution of mergers and gas accretion. As a result of their combined effect, we observe a broad range of values of the spin magnitude at the high-mass end. Our predictions for the distributions of BH spin and spin-dependent radiative efficiency as a function of BH mass are in very good agreement with observations.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Supernova Neutrino Detection in LZ,"In the first 10 seconds of a core-collapse supernova, almost all of its progenitor's gravitational potential, O(10$^{53}$~ergs), is carried away in the form of neutrinos. These neutrinos, with O(10~MeV) kinetic energy, can interact via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) depositing O(1~keV) in detectors. In this work, we demonstrate that low-background dark matter detectors, such as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), optimized for detecting low-energy depositions, are capable of detecting these neutrino interactions. For instance, a 27~M$_\odot$ supernova at 10~kpc is expected to produce $\sim$350 neutrino interactions in the 7-tonne liquid xenon active volume of LZ.

The spreading of computer viruses on time-varying networks,"Social networks are the prime channel for the spreading of computer viruses.

For example, the double aspect theory of information holds that information has a phenomenal aspect. How then do you get from phenomenal information to human consciousness? This paper proposes that an entity is conscious to the extent it amplifies information, first by trapping and integrating it through closure, and second by maintaining dynamics at the edge of chaos through simultaneous processes of divergence and convergence. The origin of life through autocatalytic closure, and the origin of an interconnected worldview through conceptual closure, induced phase transitions in the degree to which information, and thus consciousness, is locally amplified. Divergence and convergence of cognitive information may involve phenomena observed in light e.g. focusing, interference, and resonance. By making information flow inward-biased, closure shields us from external consciousness; thus the paucity of consciousness may be an illusion.",nlin,nlin.AO,0

VI. Optical Spectrophotometry of Luhman 16B Reveals Large-amplitude Variations in the Alkali Lines,"Using a novel wide-slit, multi-object approach with the GMOS spectrograph on the 8-meter Gemini South telescope, we have obtained precise time-series spectrophotometry of the binary brown dwarf Luhman 16 at optical wavelengths over two full nights. The B component of this binary system is known to be variable in the red optical and near-infrared with a period of 5 hr and an amplitude of 5--20%. Our observations probe its spectrally-resolved variability in the 6000--10000 Angstrom range. At wavelengths affected by the extremely strong, broadened spectral lines of the neutral alkali metals (the potassium doublet centered near 7682 Angstroms and the sodium doublet at 5893 Angstroms), we see photometric variations that differ strikingly from the those of the 8000--10000 Angstrom `red continuum' that dominates our detected flux. On UT 2014 February 24, these variations are anticorrelated with the red continuum, while on Feb 25 they have a large relative phase shift. The extent to which the wavelength-dependent photometric behavior diverges from that of the red continuum appears to correlate with the strength of the alkali absorption. We consider but ultimately reject models in which our observations are explained by lightning or auroral activity. A more likely cause is cloud-correlated, altitude-dependent variations in the gas-phase abundances of sodium and potassium, which are in chemical equilibrium with their chlorides in brown dwarf atmospheres.

Maximum likelihood kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich velocity reconstruction,"The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies induced by the scattering of CMB photons from free electrons, will be measured by near-term CMB experiments at high significance. By combining CMB temperature anisotropies with a tracer of structure, such as a galaxy redshift survey, previous literature introduced a number of techniques to reconstruct the radial velocity field. This reconstructed radial velocity field encapsulates the majority of the cosmological information contained in the kSZ temperature anisotropies, and can provide powerful new tests of the standard cosmological model and theories beyond it. In this paper, we introduce a new estimator for the radial velocity field based on a coarse-grained maximum likelihood fit for the kSZ component of the temperature anisotropies, given a tracer of the optical depth. We demonstrate that this maximum likelihood estimator yields a higher fidelity reconstruction than existing quadratic estimators in the low-noise and high-resolution regime targeted by upcoming CMB experiments. We describe implementations of the maximum likelihood estimator in both harmonic space and map space, using either direct measurements of the optical depth field or a galaxy survey as a tracer.

We are sensitive to brightness changes on time scales from 10 minutes to two weeks with amplitudes as low as 0.004 magnitudes, and find variability on these time scales in nearly 70% of cluster members. We identify both periodic and aperiodic modes of variability, as well as semi-periodic rapid fading events that are not accounted for by the standard explanations of rotational modulation of surface features or accretion. We have incorporated both optical and infrared color data to uncover trends in variability with mass and circumstellar disks. While the data confirm that the lowest-mass objects (M<0.2M_\odot) rotate more rapidly than the 0.2-0.5 M_\odot members, they do not support a direct connection between rotation rate and the presence of a disk. Finally, we speculate on the origin of irregular variability in cluster members with no evidence for disks or accretion.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,0
Stochasticity of Road Traffic Dynamics: Comprehensive Linear and Nonlinear Time Series Analysis on High Resolution Freeway Traffic Records,"The dynamical properties of road traffic time series from North-Rhine Westphalian motorways are investigated. The article shows that road traffic dynamics is well described as a persistent stochastic process with two fixed points representing the freeflow (non-congested) and the congested state regime. These traffic states have different statistical properties, with respect to waiting time distribution, velocity distribution and autocorrelation. Logdifferences of velocity records reveal non-normal, obviously leptocurtic distribution. Further, linear and nonlinear phase-plane based analysis methods yield no evidence for any determinism or deterministic chaos to be involved in traffic dynamics on shorter than diurnal time scales. Several Hurst-exponent estimators indicate long-range dependence for the free flow state. Finally, our results are not in accordance to the typical heuristic fingerprints of self-organized criticality. We suggest the more simplistic assumption of a non-critical phase transition between freeflow and congested traffic.",physics,physics.data-an,Student Use of a Single Lecture Video in a Flipped Introductory Mechanics Course,"In the Fall of 2013, Georgia Tech offered a 'flipped' calculus-based introductory mechanics class as an alternative to the traditional large-enrollment lecture class.

We found that a single layer with time-delayed intra-layer coupling, depending on the values of time delay, experiences a different type of transition to synchronization, e.g., ES or continuous, and the same type of transition is incorporated simultaneously in other layer(s) as well. Hence, a suitable choice of time-delay in only one layer can lead to a desired (either ES or continuous) transition simultaneously in the delayed and other undelayed layers of multiplexed network.

The $S_{11}- N$(1535) and $-N$(1650) Resonances in Meson-Baryon Unitarized Coupled Channel Chiral Perturbation Theory,"The $s-$wave meson-baryon scattering is analyzed for the strangeness S=0 sector in a Bethe-Salpeter coupled channel formalism incorporating Chiral Symmetry. Four channels have been considered: $\pi N$, $\eta N$, $K \Lambda$, $K \Sigma$. The needed two particle irreducible matrix amplitude is taken from lowest order Chiral Perturbation Theory in a relativistic formalism and low energy constants are fitted to the elastic $\pi N $ phase-shifts and the $\pi^- p \to \eta n$ and $\pi^- p \to K^0 \Lambda$ cross section data. The position of the complex poles in the second Riemann sheet of the scattering amplitude determine masses and widths of the $S_{11}-$ $N$(1535) and $-N$(1650) resonances, in reasonable agreement with experiment.

Gravitational waves induced by spinor fields,"In realistic model-building, spinor fields with various masses are present. During inflation, spinor field may induce gravitational waves as a second order effect. In this paper, we calculate the contribution of single massive spinor field to the power spectrum of primordial gravitational wave by using retarded Green propagator. We find that the correction is scale-invariant and of order $H^4/M_P^4$ for arbitrary spinor mass $m_{\psi}$. Additionally, we also observe that when $m_\psi \gtrsim H$, the dependence of correction on $m_\psi/H$ is nontrivial.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Can brown dwarfs survive on close orbits around convective stars?,"Brown dwarfs straddle the mass range transition from planetary to stellar objects. There is a relative paucity of brown dwarfs companions around FGKM stars compared to exoplanets for orbital periods less than a few years, but most of the short-period brown dwarf companions fully characterised by transits and radial velocities are found around F-type stars. We examine the hypothesis that brown dwarf companions could not survive on close orbit around stars with important convective envelopes because the tides and angular momentum loss through magnetic breaking should lead to a rapid orbital decay and quick engulfment of the companion. We use a classical Skumanich-type braking law, and constant time-lag tidal theory to assess the characteristic timescale for orbital decay for the brown dwarf mass range as a function of the host properties. We find that F-type stars may host massive companions for a significantly longer time than G-type stars for a given orbital period, which may explain the paucity of G-type hosts for brown dwarfs with orbital period less than 5 days. On the other hand, we show that the small radius of early M-type stars contributes to orbital decay timescales that are only half those of F-type stars, despite their more efficient tidal dissipation and magnetic braking. For fully convective later type M-dwarfs, orbital decay timescales could be orders of magnitude greater than for F-type stars. For orbital periods greater than 10 days, brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by tidal decay, whatever the mass of the host. On closer orbital periods, the rapid engulfment of massive companions could explain the lack of G and K-type hosts in the sample of known systems with transiting brown dwarfs. However, the paucity of M-type hosts can not be an effect of tidal decay alone, but may be the result of a selection effect in the sample and/or the formation mechanism.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,0
"Polarimetry in M\""ossbauer spectroscopy with Synchrotron M\""ossbauer Source","We have tested the new experimental techniques in the M\""ossbauer spectroscopy with Synchrotron M\""ossbauer Source by using the polarization analysis of the reflected radiation. In particular we have shown that the dichroic components in M\""ossbauer spectra create the scattering intensity with ""rotated"" polarization. The angular dependence for such component in the reflected signal is characterized by the peak near the critical angle of the total external reflection, and in the case of the collinear antiferromagnetic interlayer ordering the ""magnetic"" maxima on the reflectivity curve are formed mainly by this ""rotated"" polarization. The first experiment on M\""ossbauer reflectivity with selection of the ""rotated"" polarization shows the expected peak near the critical angle. The measured M\""ossbauer reflectivity spectra of the ""rotated"" polarization near the critical angle are rather different from the M\""ossbauer reflectivity spectra, measured without polarization analysis. They contain a smaller number of lines and can simplify the interpretation of the poorly resolved spectra. The enhanced surface sensitivity of the new technique is discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Nucleation of a three-state spin model on complex networks,"We study the metastability and nucleation of the Blume-Capel model on complex networks, in which each node can take one of three possible spin variables $\left\{ {-1, 0, 1} \right\}$. We consider the external magnetic field $h$ to be positive, and let the chemical potential $\lambda$ vary between $-h$ and $h$ in a low temperature, such that the $1$ configuration is stable, and $-1$ configuration and/or $0$ configuration are metastable. Combining the heterogeneous mean-field theory with simulations, we show that there exist four regions with distinct nucleation scenarios depending on the values of $h$ and $\lambda$: the system undergoes a two-step nucleation process from $-1$ configuration to $0$ configuration and then to $1$ configuration (region I); nucleation becomes a one-step process without an intermediate metastable configuration directly from $-1$ configuration to $1$ configuration (region II(1)) or directly from $0$ configuration to $1$ configuration (region II(2)) depending on the sign of $\lambda$; the metastability of the system vanishes and nucleation is thus irrelevant (region III). Furthermore, we show that in the region I nucleation rates for each step intersect that results in the occurrence of a maximum in the total nucleation rate.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,0
Measured proton electromagnetic structure deviates from theoretical predictions,"The visible world is founded on the proton, the only composite building block of matter that is stable in nature. Consequently, understanding the formation of matter relies on explaining the dynamics and the properties of the proton's bound state.A fundamental property of the proton involves the response of the system to an external electromagnetic field. It is characterized by the electromagnetic polarizabilities that describe how easily the charge and magnetization distributions inside the system are distorted by the electromagnetic field. Moreover, the generalized polarizabilities map out the resulting deformation of the densities in a proton subject to an electromagnetic field. They disclose essential information about the underlying system dynamics and provide a key for decoding the proton structure in terms of the theory of the strong interaction that binds its elementary quark and gluon constituents. Of particular interest is a puzzle in the electric generalized polarizability of the proton that remains unresolved for two decades. Here we report measurements of the proton's electromagnetic generalized polarizabilities at low four-momentum transfer squared. We show evidence of an anomaly to the behaviour of the proton's electric generalized polarizability that contradicts the predictions of nuclear theory and derive its signature in the spatial distribution of the induced polarization in the proton. The reported measurements suggest the presence of a new, not-yet-understood dynamical mechanism in the proton and present notable challenges to the nuclear theory.",nucl,nucl-ex,Vector meson photoproduction processes near threshold,"We discuss the photoproduction processes of light vector mesons ($\rho$, $\omega$, and $\phi$) from the nucleon near threshold.

As examples, we discuss the missing nucleon resonances problem in $\omega$ photoproduction and the direct $\phi NN$ coupling constant in $\phi$ photoproduction. The calculated cross sections are compared with the recent experimental data. Various spin observables are discussed, which may be measured at current photon/electron facilities such as TJNAF and SPring-8 of RCNP.

"Reply to Comment on ""Statistical mechanics of developable ribbons""","Starostin and van der Heijden [arXiv:1111.2029] question the validity of the results reported in our Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 238104 (2010)] regarding the existence of spontaneous helical structure in finite-temperature developable ribbons. According to the authors of the Comment, our setting is affected by a systematic error in the calculation of the torsion \tau\ that results in a bias of the Monte Carlo sampling toward helical configurations, and originates from the fact that the Frenet frame, used by us to describe the centerline of the ribbons, rotates by 180^{\circ} about the direction of the tangent vector every time an inflection point (i.e. a point where the curvature \kappa\ changes in sign) is encountered. While the rotation of the frame at infection points is a well known property of Frenet frame, the conclusions of Starostin and van der Heijden on how this phenomenon would affect the Monte Carlo sampling are incorrect, as are many of the other statements that they make.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Momentum resolved Floquet-engineered pair and single particle filter in the Fermi Hubbard model,"We investigate the transport properties of a Fermi-Hubbard chain with an impurity which is formed by a site with a periodically modulated chemical potential.

Structure and properties of the vacuum of the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai model,"We investigate numerically the phase structure of the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) model in four dimensions. In the numerical simulations of the zero temperature TEK model (using a symmetric twist) we observe the existence of new phases that break its centre symmetry at intermediate lattice couplings and for large SU(N) gauge groups. This effect can be explained by the contribution of diagonal configurations with collapsed eigenvalues, which are particular cases of ``generalised fluxons''. We also investigate finite temperature versions of the TEK model using anisotropic lattice couplings, where in particular we find van Baal fluxons contributing at large anisotropies.",hep,hep-lat,Gauge-Invariant Formalism with a Dirac-mode Expansion for Confinement and Chiral Symmetry Breaking,"Using the eigen-mode of the QCD Dirac operator $\Slash D=\gamma^\mu D^\mu$, we develop a manifestly gauge-covariant expansion and projection of the QCD operators such as the Wilson loop and the Polyakov loop. With this method, we perform a direct analysis of the correlation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in lattice QCD Monte Carlo calculation on $6^4$ at $\beta$=5.6. Even after removing the low-lying Dirac modes, which are responsible to chiral symmetry breaking, we find that the Wilson loop obeys the area law, and the slope parameter corresponding to the string tension or the confinement force is almost unchanged. We find also that the Polyakov loop remains to be almost zero even without the low-lying Dirac modes, which indicates the $Z_3$-unbroken confinement phase. These results indicate that one-to-one correspondence does not hold for between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.",hep,hep-ph,0
Polarimetric observation of noise of linear birefringence of cesium atomic vapors spectrally localized at double Larmor frequency in a magnetic field,"We study radio-frequency spectrum of ellipticity noise of a probe laser beam transmitted through a cell with cesium vapor in a magnetic field. The experimental results are interpreted in terms of the model proposed by Gorbovitskii and Perel (Opt. Spektrosc. 54, 388 (1983)) according to which the observed noise arises due to heterodyning of the light scattered by fluctuations of the tensor $ \alpha $ of optical susceptibility of cesium vapor. We show, both experimentally and theoretically, that, in the noise measurements if this kind, along with fluctuations of the antisymmetric (gyrotropic) part of the tensor $ \alpha $ at the Larmor frequency, may be observed fluctuations of its symmetric part, corresponding to fluctuations of linear birefringence (alignment) of the atomic system.

To empirically validate the model, the methodology is based both on numerical and experimental studies. A parametric sensitivity analysis was performed and a set of parameters of the thermal model have been identified for optimization. The use of a generic optimization program called GenOpt coupled to the building simulation code enabled to determine the set of adequate parameters. We first present the empirical validation methodology and main results of previous work. We then give an overview of GenOpt and its coupling with the building simulation code.

Recent results on two-particle correlations in ALICE,"The discovery of correlations between particles separated by several units of pseudorapidity in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions, reminiscent of structures observed in Pb-Pb collisions, was a challenge to traditional ideas about collectivity in heavy ion collisions. In order to further explore long-range correlations and provide information to theoretical models, correlations between forward trigger muons and mid-rapidity associated hadrons were measured in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mbox{NN}}} = 5.02~\mbox{TeV}$. The results demonstrate that the nearside and awayside ridges extend to $\Delta\eta \sim \pm 5$ and that the $v_2$ of muons, obtained from subtracting the correlation functions in high- and low-multiplicity events, is $(16\pm6)\%$ higher in the Pb-going than in the p-going direction.

In particular, we examine the charmonium `melting' and the `comover dissociation' scenarios - implemented in a microscopic transport approach - in comparison to the available data from the SPS and RHIC. The analysis shows that the dynamics of c, c-bar quarks at RHIC are dominated by partonic or `pre-hadronic' interactions in the strongly coupled plasma stage. Both the `charmonium melting' and the hadronic `comover absorption and recreation model' are found, however, to be compatible with the experimental observation at SPS energies; the experimental ratio of Psi'/J/Psi versus centrality clearly favors the `hadronic comover' scenario. We find that the collective flow of charm in the purely hadronic Hadron-String Dynamics (HSD) transport appears compatible with the data at SPS energies, but substantially underestimates the data at top RHIC energies. Thus, the large elliptic flow v2 of D-mesons and the low R_AA(p_T) of J/Psi seen experimentally have to be attributed to early interactions of non-hadronic degrees of freedom. Simultaneously, we observe that non-hadronic interactions are mandatory in order to describe the narrowing of the J/Psi rapidity distribution from pp to central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy. We demonstrate additionally that the strong quenching of low-pT J/Psi's in central Au+Au collisions indicates that a large fraction of final J/Psi mesons is created by a coalescence mechanism close to the phase boundary. Throughout this review we, furthermore, provide predictions for charm observables from Au+Au collisions at FAIR energies of 25-35 AGeV.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Induced superconductivity in high mobility two dimensional electron gas in GaAs heterostructures,"Introduction of a Josephson field effect transistor (JoFET) concept sparked active research on proximity effects in semiconductors. Induced superconductivity and electrostatic control of critical current has been demonstrated in two-dimensional gases in InAs, graphene and topological insulators, and in one-dimensional systems including quantum spin Hall edges. Recently, interest in superconductor-semiconductor interfaces was renewed by the search for Majorana fermions, which were predicted to reside at the interface. More exotic non-Abelian excitations, such as parafermions (fractional Majorana fermions) or Fibonacci fermions may be formed when fractional quantum Hall edge states interface with superconductivity. In this paper we develop transparent superconducting contacts to high mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in GaAs and demonstrate induced superconductivity across several microns. Supercurrent in a ballistic junction has been observed across 0.6 $\mu$m of 2DEG, a regime previously achieved only in point contacts but essential to the formation of well separated non-Abelian states.

Off-resonant all-optical switching dynamics in a ferromagnetic model system,"We present a theoretical study of the the effects of off-resonant polarized optical fields on a ferromagnetic model system. We determine the light-induced dynamics of itinerant carriers in a system that includes magnetism at the mean-field level and spin-orbit coupling. We investigate an all-optical switching process for ferromagnets, which is close to the one proposed by Qaiumzadeh et al. [Phys. Rev. B 88, 064416] for the inverse Faraday effect. By computing the optically driven coherent dynamics together with incoherent scattering mechanisms we go beyond a perturbation expansion in powers of the optical field. We find an important contribution of a dynamic Stark effect coupling of the Raman type between the magnetic bands, which leads to a polarization-dependent effect on the magnetization that may support or oppose switching, but also contributes to demagnetization via an increase in electronic energy.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Room-temperature Low-field Colossal Magneto-resistance in Double-perovskite Manganite,"The gigantic decrease of resistance by an applied magnetic field, which is often referred to as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), has been an attracting phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. The discovery of CMR in manganese oxide compounds has developed the science of strong coupling among charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom. CMR is also attracting scientists from the viewpoint of possible applications to sensors, memories, and so on. However, no application using CMR effect has been achieved so far, partly because the CMR materials which satisfy all of the required conditions for the application, namely, high operating temperature, low operating magnetic field, and sharp resistive change, have not been discovered. Here we report a resistance change of more than two-orders of magnitude at a magnetic field lower than 2 T near 300 K in an A-site ordered NdBaMn_2_O_6_ crystal. When temperature and a magnetic field sweep from insulating (metallic) phase to metallic (insulating) phase, the insulating (metallic) conduction changes to the metallic (insulating) conduction within 1 K and 0.5 T, respectively. The CMR is ascribed to the melting of the charge ordering. The entropy change which is estimated from the B-T phase diagram is smaller than what is expected for the charge and orbital ordering. The suppression of the entropy change is attributable to the loss of the short range ferromagnetic fluctuation of Mn spin moments, which an important key of the high temperature and low magnetic field CMR effect.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,0
Formation of planetary debris discs around white dwarfs I: Tidal disruption of an extremely eccentric asteroid,"25%-50% of all white dwarfs (WDs) host observable and dynamically active remnant planetary systems based on the presence of close-in circumstellar dust and gas and photospheric metal pollution. Currently-accepted theoretical explanations for the origin of this matter include asteroids that survive the star's giant branch evolution at au-scale distances and are subsequently perturbed onto WD-grazing orbits following stellar mass loss. In this work we investigate the tidal disruption of these highly-eccentric (e > 0.98) asteroids as they approach and tidally disrupt around the WD. We analytically compute the disruption timescale and compare the result with fully self-consistent numerical simulations of rubble piles by using the N-body code PKDGRAV. We find that this timescale is highly dependent on the orbit's pericentre and largely independent of its semimajor axis. We establish that spherical asteroids readily break up and form highly eccentric collisionless rings, which do not accrete onto the WD without additional forces such as radiation or sublimation. This finding highlights the critical importance of such forces in the physics of WD planetary systems.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,Discovery of new X-ray sources near the unidentified gamma-ray source HESS J1841-055,"HESS J1841$-$055 is a diffuse unidentified gamma-ray source with the size of $\sim\,1.3^{\circ}\times\,1^{\circ}$. No conclusive counterpart in other wavelengths has so far detected. To search for X-rays responsible for the TeV emission, the Suzaku observations were conducted, which covered a half region of the HESS source. In the soft band (0.5-2.0 keV), we discovered a diffuse emission, Suzaku J1840.2$-$0552, with the size of $\sim10'$. Since its spectrum was fitted by an optically thin thermal plasma model, Suzaku J1840.2$-$0552 is likely to be a supernova remnant. We also discovered an extended source, Suzaku J1840.2$-$0544, in the hard band (2.0-8.0 keV) with an emission line at 6.1 keV. From the spectral feature and large interstellar absorption, this source is likely to be a cluster of galaxies behind the Galactic plane at the red-shift of $\sim$0.09. The other diffuse source spatially overlaps with the SNR candidate G26.6$-$0.2, which shows a non-thermal dominant spectrum.

Search for dijet resonances in events with an isolated charged lepton using $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector,"A search for dijet resonances in events with at least one isolated charged lepton is performed using $139~{\text{fb}}^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The dijet invariant-mass ($m_{jj}$) distribution constructed from events with at least one isolated electron or muon is searched in the region $0.22 < m_{jj} < 6.3$ TeV for excesses above a smoothly falling background from Standard Model processes. Triggering based on the presence of a lepton in the event reduces limitations imposed by minimum transverse momentum thresholds for triggering on jets. This approach allows smaller dijet invariant masses to be probed than in inclusive dijet searches, targeting a variety of new-physics models, for example ones in which a new state is produced in association with a leptonically decaying $W$ or $Z$ boson. No statistically significant deviation from the Standard Model background hypothesis is found. Limits on contributions from generic Gaussian signals with widths ranging from that determined by the detector resolution up to 15% of the resonance mass are obtained for dijet invariant masses ranging from 0.25 TeV to 6 TeV.

The model is confining at low energy and we use lattice simulations to investigate the properties of the lowest-lying hadrons. Compared to QCD, the theory has several peculiar differences: there are no Goldstone bosons or chiral symmetry restoration when the dark quark becomes massless; the usual global baryon number symmetry is enlarged to $\rm{SU}(2)_B$, resembling isospin; and baryons and mesons are unified together in $\rm{SU}(2)_B$ iso-multiplets. We argue that the lightest baryon, a vector boson, is a stable dark matter candidate and is a composite realization of the hidden vector dark matter scenario. The model naturally includes a lighter state, the analog of the $\eta^\prime$ in QCD, for dark matter to annihilate into to set the relic density via thermal freeze-out. Dark matter baryons may also be asymmetric, strongly self-interacting, or have their relic density set via $3 \to 2$ cannibalizing transitions.

Electron scattering on microscopic corrugations in graphene,"We discuss various scattering mechanisms for Dirac fermions in single-layer graphene.

The latter are an inherent feature of graphene due to its two-dimensional nature and can also be an important factor in defining the electron mean free path.

The Stellar Kinematic Center and the True Galactic Nucleus of NGC253,"We present the first sub-arcsecond resolution two-dimensional stellar kinematics and X-ray observations of the prototypical starburst galaxy NGC253 which define the position and nature of the galactic nucleus. We get an estimate of the stellar kinematic center location corresponding to an area of r~1.2"" centered 0.7"" southwest from the radio core (TH2). Newly processed Chandra data reveal a central hard X-ray source (X-1) lying 0.4"" southwest from the kinematic center. Very accurate alignment between radio, infrared and X-ray sources shows that TH2, the IR photometric center and X-1 are not associated with each other. As the kinematic center is consistent with TH2 and X-1, we consider the two as possible galactic nucleus candidates. Although TH2 is the strongest radio source in the nuclear region, it does not have any infrared, optical or X-ray counterparts. If the kinematic center is associated with this source, by analogy we suggest that the nucleus of NGC253 resembles our Galactic Center SgrA*. On the other hand, X-1 is a heavily absorbed object only detected at energies >2 keV. If X-1 is instead associated with the kinematic center, the nucleus of NGC253 is compatible with an obscured low luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a spatially resolved super star cluster (SSC) brightening up in X-rays most probably due to young supernovae or supernova remnants. If no SSC is associated with the kinematic center, we conclude that NGC253 is a galaxy in which a strong starburst and a weak AGN (either TH2 or X-1) coexist. Results from few other high resolution studies of nearby starburst galaxies indicate that the AGN in these systems, if present, is always in the low luminosity regime. This may indicate that the onset of nuclear activity in galaxies is closely related with the occurrence of star formation, and that we are witnessing the emergence or disappearance of an AGN.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,The Cherenkov Telescope Array Performance in Divergent Mode,"Two of the Key Science Projects of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) consist in performing a deep survey of the Galactic and Extragalactic sky, providing an unbiased view of the Universe at energies above tens of GeV. To optimize the time spent to perform the Extragalactic survey, a so-called ""divergent mode"" of the CTA was proposed as an alternative observation strategy to the traditional parallel pointing in order to increase its instantaneous field of view. The search for transient VHE sources would also benefit from an extended field of view. In the divergent mode, each telescope points to a position in the sky that is slightly offset, in the outward direction, from the center of the field of view. In this contribution, we present the first performance estimation from full Monte Carlo simulation of possible CTA divergent mode setups.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,0
Interfaces in driven Ising models: shear enhances confinement,"We use a phase-separated driven two-dimensional Ising lattice gas to study fluid interfaces exposed to shear flow parallel to the interface. The interface is stabilized by two parallel walls with opposing surface fields and a driving field parallel to the walls is applied which (i) either acts locally at the walls or (ii) varies linearly with distance across the strip. Using computer simulations with Kawasaki dynamics, we find that the system reaches a steady state in which the magnetisation profile is the same as that in equilibrium, but with a rescaled length implying a reduction of the interfacial width. An analogous effect was recently observed in sheared phase-separated colloidal dispersions. Pair correlation functions along the interface decay more rapidly with distance under drive than in equilibrium and for cases of weak drive can be rescaled to the equilibrium result.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Antipersistant Effects in the Dynamics of a Competing Population,"We consider a population of agents competing for finite resources using strategies based on two channels of signals. The model is applicable to financial markets, ecosystems and computer networks. We find that the dynamics of the system is determined by the correlation between the two channels. In particular, occasional mismatches of the signals induce a series of transitions among numerous attractors. Surprisingly, in contrast to the effects of noises on dynamical systems normally resulting in a large number of attractors, the number of attractors due to the mismatched signals remains finite. Both simulations and analyses show that this can be explained by the antipersistent nature of the dynamics. Antipersistence refers to the response of the system to a given signal being opposite to that of the signal's previous occurrence, and is a consequence of the competition of the agents to make minority decisions. Thus, it is essential for stabilizing the dynamical systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,0
Radiation of caustic beams from a collapsing bullet,"Collapse of an intense (2+1)-dimensional wave packet in a medium with cubic nonlinearity and a two-dimensional dispersion of an order higher than parabolic is studied both theoretically and experimentally. The carrier waves are microwave backward volume spin waves which propagate in a stripe made from a thin ferrimagnetic film and the packet is a spin-wave bullet. We show that before being self-destroyed the bullet irradiates untrapped dispersive waves, which is in agreement with a previous theoretical prediction. Since, in addition, the ferromagnetic medium is characterized by an induced uniaxial anisotropy, this radiation takes the form of narrow beams of continuous waves at very specific angles to its propagation direction. Based on our theoretical calculations we find that these beams are caustic beams and the angles are the characteristic spin-wave caustic angles modified by the motion of the source.",nlin,nlin.PS,On the dynamics of the singularities of the solutions of some non-linear integrable differential equations,"This paper concerns with some of the results related to the singular solutions of certain types of non-linear integrable differential equations (NIDE) and behavior of the singularities of those equations. The approach heavily relies on the Method of Operator Identities which proved to be a powerful tool in different areas such as interpolation problems, spectral analysis, inverse spectral problems, dynamic systems, non-linear equations. We formulate and solve a number of problems (direct and inverse) related to the singular solutions of sinh-Gordon, non-linear Schr\""{o}dinger and modified Korteweg - de Vries equations. Dynamics of the singularities of these solutions suggests that they can be interpreted in terms of particles interacting through the fields surrounding them. We derive differential equations describing the dynamics of the singularities and solve some of the related problems. The developed methodologies are illustrated by numerous examples.",nlin,nlin.SI,0
Spiraling elliptic solitons in generic nonlocal nonlinear media,We have introduced a class of spiraling elliptic solitons in generic nonlocal nonlinear media. The spiraling elliptic solitons carry the orbital angular momentum. This class solitons are stable for any degree of nonlocality except for the local case when the response function of the material is Gaussian function.,nlin,nlin.PS,Study of a model equation in detonation theory,"Here we analyze properties of an equation that we previously proposed to model the dynamics of unstable detonation waves [A. R. Kasimov, L. M. Faria, and R. R. Rosales. Model for shock wave chaos. Physical Review Letters, 110(10):104104, 2013]. The equation is \[ u_{t}+\frac{1}{2}\left(u^{2}-uu\left(0_{-},t\right)\right)_{x}=f\left(x,u\left(0_{-},t\right)\right),\quad x\le0,\quad t>0. \] It describes a detonation shock at $x=0$ with the reaction zone in $x<0$. We investigate the nature of the steady-state solutions of this nonlocal hyperbolic balance law, the linear stability of these solutions, and the nonlinear dynamics. We establish the existence of instability followed by a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations leading to chaos.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Polarization of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons along the beam direction in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV,"The $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperon polarization along the beam direction has been measured for the first time in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The polarization dependence on the hyperons' emission angle relative to the second-order event plane exhibits a sine modulation, indicating a quadrupole pattern of the vorticity component along the beam direction. The polarization is found to increase in more peripheral collisions, and shows no strong transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence at $p_T>1$ GeV/$c$. The magnitude of the signal is about five times smaller than those predicted by hydrodynamic and multiphase transport models; the observed phase of the emission angle dependence is also opposite to these model predictions. In contrast, blast-wave model calculations reproduce the modulation phase measured in the data and capture the centrality and transverse momentum dependence of the signal once the model is required to reproduce the azimuthal dependence of the Gaussian source radii measured via the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss intensity interferometry technique.",nucl,nucl-ex,From asymmetric nuclear matter to neutron stars: a functional renormalization group study,"A previous study of nuclear matter in a chiral nucleon-meson model is extended to isospin-asymmetric matter. Fluctuations beyond mean-field approximation are treated in the framework of the functional renormalization group. The nuclear liquid-gas phase transition is investigated in detail as a function of the proton fraction in asymmetric matter. The equations of state at zero temperature of both symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are found to be in good agreement with realistic many-body computations. We also study the density dependence of the pion mass in the medium. The question of chiral symmetry restoration in neutron matter is addressed; we find a stabilization of the phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry once fluctuations are included. Finally, neutron star matter including beta equilibrium is discussed. The model satisfies the constraints imposed by the existence of two-solar-mass neutron stars.",nucl,nucl-th,0
Experiment and theory: the case of the Doppler effect for photons,"In 1907, Einstein suggested an experiment with flying atoms for corroborating time dilation. In that paper, the flying atom was conceived as a flying clock: the reference to the Doppler effect was only indirect (the experiments by Stark to the first order of $v/c$). In 1922, Schr\""odinger showed that the emission of a light quantum by a (flying) atom is regulated by the conservation laws of energy and linear momentum. Therefore, the Doppler effect for photons is the consequence of the energy and momentum exchange between the atom and the photon: a central role is played by the quantum energy jump $\Delta E$ of the transition (a relativistic invariant). The first realization of the experiment devised by Einstein is due to Ives and Stilwell (1938). Since then till nowadays experiments of this kind have been repeated in search of better precision and/or a deviation from the predictions of special relativity. The striking feature is that all the papers dealing with these experiments completely neglect Schr\""odinger's dynamical treatment. The origins of this omission are of different kind: pragmatic (agreement between formulas, wherever coming from, and experiments), historical (deep rooting of the wave theory of light) and epistemological (neglect of basic epistemological rules).",physics,physics.hist-ph,An Introduction to Control of Chaos for Quasi-Integrable Hamiltonian Systems,"Quasi-integrable Hamiltonian systems are of great interest in many research fields of physics and mathematics. In these systems, the phase space has regular and chaotic trajectories. These trajectories depend in part on the magnitude of perturbation that breaks the integrability of the system. The value of the critical perturbation responsible for this transition is a key element in the control of chaos . In this paper, we explore a procedure for the control in quasi-integrable Hamiltonian systems via canonical map. Initially, we present the basic tools for this study: Hamiltonian map, linearization of the map and Chirikov criterion. Subsequently, we investigated the behavior of a wave-particle interaction front perturbation. Finally, we confront with a numerical analytical approach (iteration of the map) results, showing a good agreement.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,0
Heavy Quark Physics on the Lattice,"I review the current status of lattice calculations of the properties of bound states containing one or more heavy quarks. Many of my remarks focus on the heavy-light leptonic decay constants, such as $f_B$, for which the systematic errors have by now been quite well studied. I also discuss $B$-parameters, semileptonic form factors, and the heavy-light and heavy-heavy spectra. Some of my ``world averages'' are: $f_B=200(30) MeV$, $f_B\sqrt{\hat B_{B_d}}= 230(40) MeV$, $f_{B_s}/f_B=1.16(4)$ and $f_{B_s}\sqrt{\hat B_{B_s}}/f_B\sqrt{\hat B_{B_d}}=1.16(5)$.",hep,hep-lat,Tunneling Without Bounce,"The false vacua of some potentials do not decay via Euclidean bounces. This typically happens for tunneling actions with a flat direction (in field configuration space) that is lifted by a perturbation into a sloping valley, pushing the bounce off to infinity. Using three different approaches we find a consistent picture for such decays. In the Euclidean approach the bottom of the action valley consists of a family of pseudo-bounces (field configurations with some key good properties of bounces except extremizing the action). The pseudo-bounce result is validated by minimizing a WKB action in Minkowski space along appropriate paths in configuration space. Finally, the simplest approach uses the tunneling action method proposed recently with a simple modification of boundary conditions.",hep,hep-th,0
Coherent Curvature Radiation Spectrum by Dynamically Fluctuating Bunches in Magnetospheres,"Coherent curvature radiation by charged bunches has been discussed as the radiation mechanism for radio pulsars and fast radio bursts. Important issues for this radiation mechanism include how the bunches form and disperse in the magnetosphere of a pulsar or magnetar. More likely, bunches form and disperse continuously and it remains unclear what the spectral features are for these fluctuating bunches. In this work, we consider that the bunches in a magnetosphere have a formation rate of $\lambda_B$, a lifetime of $\tau_B$, and a typical Lorentz factor of $\gamma$, and analyze the spectral features of coherent curvature radiation by these fluctuating bunches. We find that the emission spectrum by a single fluctuating bunch is suppressed by a factor of $\sim(\lambda_B\tau_B)^2$ compared with that of a single persistent bunch, and there is a quasi-white noise in a wider band in the frequency domain. The high-frequency cutoff of the spectrum is at $\sim\max(\omega_{\rm peak},2\gamma^2/\tau_B)$, where $\omega_{\rm peak}$ is the peak frequency of curvature radiation. If the observed spectrum is not white-noise-like, the condition of $2\gamma^2\lambda_B\gtrsim \min(\omega_{\rm peak},2\gamma^2/\tau_B)$ would be required. Besides, the radiation by multiple fluctuating bunches along a field line is the incoherent summation of the radiation by single bunches if the bunch separation is longer than the wavelength. Conversely, a coherent summation should be involved. We also discuss the effects of bunch structures and the mechanism of bunch formation and dispersion.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,The Recent Growth History of the Fornax Cluster Derived from Simultaneous Sloshing and Gas Stripping: Simulating the Infall of NGC 1404,"We derive the recent growth history of the Fornax Cluster, in particular the recent infall of the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1404. We show, using a simple cluster minor merger simulation tailored to Fornax and NGC 1404, that a second or more likely third encounter between the two reproduces all main merger features observed in both objects; we firmly exclude a first infall scenario. Our simulations reveal a consistent picture: NGC 1404 passed by NGC 1399 about 1.1 - 1.3 Gyrs ago from the NE to the SW and is now almost at the point of its next encounter from the S. This scenario explains the sloshing patterns observed in Fornax - a prominent northern cold front and an inner southern cold front. This scenario also explains the truncated atmosphere, the gas stripping radius of NGC 1404, and its faint gas tail. Independent of the exact history, we can make a number of predictions. A detached bow shock south of NGC 1404 should exist which is a remnant of the galaxy's previous infall at a distance from NGC 1404 between 450 - 750 kpc with an estimated Mach number between 1.3 and 1.5. The wake of NGC 1404 also lies S of the galaxy with enhanced turbulence and a slight enhancement in metallicity compared to the undisturbed regions of the cluster. SW of NGC 1404, there is likely evidence of old turbulence originating from the previous infall. No scenario predicts enhanced turbulence outside of the cold front north west of the cluster center.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,0

However, even if the network dynamics is observable from a reduced set of measured variables, how to reliably identifying such a minimum set of variables providing full observability remains an unsolved problem. From the Jacobian matrix of the governing equations of nonlinear systems, we construct a {\it pruned fluence graph} in which the nodes are the state variables and the links represent {\it only the linear} dynamical interdependences encoded in the Jacobian matrix after ignoring nonlinear relationships. From this graph, we identify the largest connected sub-graphs where there is a path from every node to every other node and there are not outcoming links. In each one of those sub-graphs, at least one node must be measured to correctly monitor the state of the system in a $d$-dimensional reconstructed space. Our procedure is here validated by investigating large-dimensional reaction networks for which the determinant of the observability matrix can be rigorously computed.",nlin,nlin.CD,0
Signals embedded in the radial velocity noise. Periodic variations in the tau Ceti velocities,"The abilities of radial velocity exoplanet surveys to detect the lowest-mass extra-solar planets are currently limited by a combination of instrument precision, lack of data, and ""jitter"". Jitter is a general term for any unknown features in the noise, and reflects a lack of detailed knowledge of stellar physics (asteroseismology, starspots, magnetic cycles, granulation, and other stellar surface phenomena), as well as the possible underestimation of instrument noise. We study an extensive set of radial velocities for the star HD 10700 ($\tau$ Ceti) to determine the properties of the jitter arising from stellar surface inhomogeneities, activity, and telescope-instrument systems, and perform a comprehensive search for planetary signals in the radial velocities. We perform Bayesian comparisons of statistical models describing the radial velocity data to quantify the number of significant signals and the magnitude and properties of the excess noise in the data. We reach our goal by adding artificial signals to the ""flat"" radial velocity data of HD 10700 and by seeing which one of our statistical noise models receives the greatest posterior probabilities while still being able to extract the artificial signals correctly from the data. We utilise various noise components to assess properties of the noise in the data and analyse the HARPS, AAPS, and HIRES data for HD 10700 to quantify these properties and search for previously unknown low-amplitude Keplerian signals. ...",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,On the gauge dependence of gravitational waves generated at second order from scalar perturbations,"We revisit and clarify the gauge dependence of gravitational waves generated at second order from scalar perturbations. In a universe dominated by a perfect fluid with a constant equation-of-state parameter $w$, we compute the energy density of such induced gravitational waves in the Newtonian, comoving, and uniform curvature gauges. Huge differences are found between the Newtonian and comoving gauge results for any $w \,(\ge 0)$. This is always caused by the perturbation of the shift vector. Interestingly, the Newtonian and uniform curvature gauge calculations give the same energy density for $w>0$. In the case of $w=0$, the uniform curvature gauge result differs only by a factor from that of the comoving gauge, but deviates significantly from that of the Newtonian gauge. Our calculation is done analytically for $w=0$ and $w=1/3$, and our result is consistent with the previous numerical one.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,0
Decline in extinction rates and scale invariance in the fossil record,"We show that the decline in the extinction rate during the Phanerozoic can be accurately parameterized by a logarithmic fit to the cumulative total extinction. This implies that extinction intensity is falling off approximately as the reciprocal of time. We demonstrate that this observation alone is sufficient to explain the existence of the proposed power-law forms in the distribution of the sizes of extinction events and in the power spectrum of Phanerozoic extinction, results which previously have been explained by appealing to self-organized critical theories of evolutionary dynamics.",nlin,nlin.AO,Elliptic solutions to the KP hierarchy and elliptic Calogero-Moser model,We consider solutions of the KP hierarchy which are elliptic functions of $x=t_1$. It is known that their poles as functions of $t_2$ move as particles of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model. We extend this correspondence to the level of hierarchies and find the Hamiltonian $H_k$ of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model which governs the dynamics of poles with respect to the $k$-th hierarchical time. The Hamiltonians $H_k$ are obtained as coefficients of the expansion of the spectral curve near the marked point in which the Baker-Akhiezer function has essential singularity.,nlin,nlin.SI,0
Scattering of Bunched Fractionally Charged Quasiparticles,"The charge of fractionally charged quasiparticles, proposed by Laughlin to explain the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), was recently verified by measurements. Charge q=e/3 and e/5 (e is the electron charge), at filling factors nu=1/3 and 2/5, respectively, were measured. Here we report the unexpected bunching of fractional charges, induced by an extremely weak backscattering potential at exceptionally low electron temperatures (T<10 mK) - deduced from shot noise measurements. Backscattered charges q=nu e, specifically, q=e/3, q=2e/5, and q<3e/7, in the respective filling factors, were measured. For the same settings but at an only slightly higher electron temperature, the measured backscattered charges were q=e/3, q=e/5, and q=e/7. In other words, bunching of backscattered quasiparticles is taking place at sufficiently low temperatures. Moreover, the backscattered current exhibited distinct temperature dependence that was correlated to the backscattered charge and the filling factor. This observation suggests the existence of 'low' and 'high' temperature backscattering states, each with its characteristic charge and characteristic energy.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Temperature scaling in a dense vibro-fluidised granular material,"The leading order ""temperature"" of a dense two dimensional granular material fluidised by external vibrations is determined. An asymptotic solution is obtained where the particles are considered to be elastic in the leading approximation. The velocity distribution is a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the leading approximation. The density profile is determined by solving the momentum balance equation in the vertical direction, where the relation between the pressure and density is provided by the virial equation of state. The predictions of the present analysis show good agreement with simulation results at higher densities where theories for a dilute vibrated granular material, with the pressure-density relation provided by the ideal gas law, are in error. The theory also predicts the scaling relations of the total dissipation in the bed reported by McNamara and Luding (PRE v 58, p 813).",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,0

Final-state interactions in two-nucleon knockout reactions,"Background: Exclusive two-nucleon knockout after electroexcitation of nuclei ($A(e,e'NN)$ in brief) is considered to be a primary source of information about short-range correlations (SRC) in nuclei. For a proper interpretation of the data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled. Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive $A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass region. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role of FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a ""small"" and ""large"" coverage of the available phase space. Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive $(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on ""free"" nucleon pairs, drops from $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb. For all considered kinematics, the mass dependence of the $T^{pN}_{A}$ can be captured by the power law $T^{pN}_{A} \propto A^{- \lambda}$ with $ 0.4 \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 0.5 $. Apart from an overall reduction factor, we find that FSI only modestly affects the distinct features of SRC-driven $A(e,e'pN)$ which are dictated by the c.m. distribution of close-proximity pairs. Conclusion: The SCX mechanisms represent a relatively small (order of a few percent) contribution of SRC-driven $A(e,e'pN)$ processes. The mass dependence of FSI effects in exclusive $A(e,e'pN)$ can be captured in a robust power law and is in agreement with the predictions obtained in a toy model.",nucl,nucl-ex,Pion scattering and electro-production on nucleons in the resonance region in chiral quark models,"Pion scattering and electro-production amplitudes have been computed in a coupled-channel framework incorporating quasi-bound quark-model states, based on the Cloudy Bag model.

Varying constants driven baryogenesis,"We study the spontaneous baryogenesis scenario in the early universe for three different frameworks of varying constants theories. We replace the constants by dynamical scalar fields playing the role of thermions. We first obtain the results for baryogenesis driven by the varying gravitational constant, $G$, as in the previous literature, then challenge the problem for varying fine structure constant $\alpha$ models as well as for varying speed of light $c$ models. We show that in each of these frameworks the current observational value of the baryon to entropy ratio, $\eta_B \sim 8.6 \cdot 10^{-11}$, can be obtained for large set of parameters of dynamical constants models as well as the decoupling temperature, and the characteristic cut-off length scale.",hep,hep-th,Complex instantons in sigma models with chemical potential,"We analyze two-dimensional nonlinear sigma models at nonzero chemical potentials, which are governed by a complex action.

The decay of these solutions is controled by the imaginary part of mu and a vanishing imaginary part causes jumps in the action.
