The $UBV$ Color Evolution of Classical Novae. IV. Time-Stretched $(U-B)_0$-$(M_B-2.5\log f_{\rm s})$ and $(V-I)_0$-$(M_I-2.5\log f_{\rm s})$ Color-Magnitude Diagrams of Novae in Outburst,"Light curves and color evolutions of two classical novae can be largely overlapped if we properly squeeze or stretch the timescale of a target nova against that of a template nova by $t'=t/f_{\rm s}$. Then the brightness of the target nova is related to the brightness of the template nova by $(M[t])_{\rm template} = (M[t/f_{\rm s}] - 2.5 \log f_{\rm s})_{\rm target}$, where $M[t]$ is the absolute magnitude and a function of time $t$, and $f_{\rm s}$ is the ratio of timescales between the target and template novae. In the previous papers of this series, we show that many novae broadly overlap in the time-stretched $(B-V)_0$-$(M_V-2.5 \log f_{\rm s})$ color-magnitude diagram. In the present paper, we propose two other $(U-B)_0$-$(M_B-2.5\log f_{\rm s})$ and $(V-I)_0$-$(M_I-2.5\log f_{\rm s})$ diagrams, and show that their tracks overlap for 16 novae and for 52 novae, respectively. Here, $(U-B)_0$, $(B-V)_0$, and $(V-I)_0$ are the intrinsic $U-B$, $B-V$, and $V-I$ colors and not changed by the time-stretch, and $M_B$, $M_V$, and $M_I$ are the absolute $B$, $V$, and $I$ magnitudes. Using these properties, we considerably refine the previous estimates of their distance and reddening. The obtained distances are in reasonable agreement with those of {\it Gaia} Data Release 2 catalogue.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Solar transition region above sunspots,"We study the TR properties above sunspots and the surrounding plage regions, by analyzing several sunspot spectra obtained by SUMER in March 1999 and November 2006. We compare the SUMER spectra observed in the umbra, penumbra, plage, and sunspot plume regions. The Lyman line profiles averaged in each region are presented. For the sunspot observed in 2006, the electron densities, DEM, and filling factors of the TR plasma in the four regions are also investigated. The self-reversals of the Lyman line profiles are almost absent in umbral regions at different locations (heliocentric angle up to $49^\circ$) on the solar disk. In the sunspot plume, the Lyman lines are also not reversed, whilst the lower Lyman line profiles observed in the plage region are obviously reversed. The TR densities of the umbra and plume are similar and one order of magnitude lower than those of the plage and penumbra. The DEM curve of the sunspot plume exhibits a peak centered around $\log(T/\rm{K})\sim5.45$, which exceeds the DEM of other regions by one to two orders of magnitude at these temperatures. We also find that more than 100 lines, which are very weak or not observed anywhere else on the Sun, are well observed by SUMER in the sunspot, especially in the sunspot plume. We suggest that the TR above sunspots is higher and probably more extended, and that the opacity of the hydrogen lines is much smaller above sunspots, as compared to the TR above plage regions. Our result indicates that the enhanced TR emission of the sunspot plume is very likely to be the result of a large filling factor. The strongly enhanced emission at TR temperatures and the reduced continuum make many normally weak TR lines stick out clearly in the spectra of sunspot plumes.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Evolution along the sequence of S0 Hubble types induced by dry minor mergers. II - Bulge-disk coupling in the photometric relations through merger-induced internal secular evolution,"Galaxy mergers are considered as questionable mechanisms for the evolution of lenticular galaxies (S0's), on the basis that even minor ones induce structural changes that are difficult to reconcile with the strong bulge-disk coupling observed in the photometric scaling relations of S0's. We check if the evolution induced onto S0's by dry intermediate and minor mergers can reproduce their photometric scaling relations, analysing the bulge-disk decompositions of the merger simulations presented in Eliche-Moral et al. (2012). The mergers induce an evolution in the photometric planes compatible with the data of S0's, even in those ones indicating a strong bulge-disk coupling. The mergers drive the formation of the observed photometric relation in some cases, whereas they induce a slight dispersion compatible with data in others. Therefore, this evolutionary mechanism tends to preserve these scaling relations. In those photometric planes where the morphological types segregate, the mergers always induce evolution towards the region populated by S0's. The structural coupling of the bulge and the disk is preserved or reinforced because the mergers trigger internal secular processes in the primary disk that induce significant bulge growth, even although these models do not induce bars. Intermediate and minor mergers can thus be considered as plausible mechanisms for the evolution of S0's attending to their photometric scaling relations, as they can preserve and even strengthen any pre-existing structural bulge-disk coupling, triggering significant internal secular evolution (even in the absence of bars or dissipational effects). This means that it may be difficult to isolate the effects of pure internal secular evolution from those of the merger-driven one in present-day early-type disks (abridged).",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,The First Billion Years project: dark matter haloes going from contraction to expansion and back again,"We study the effect of baryons on the inner dark matter profile of the first galaxies using the First Billion Years simulation between z=16-6 before secular evolution sets in. Using a large statistical sample from two simulations of the same volume and cosmological initial conditions, one with and one without baryons, we are able to directly compare haloes with their baryon-free counterparts, allowing a detailed study of the modifications to the dark matter density profile due to the presence of baryons during the first billion years of galaxy formation. For each of the ~ 5000 haloes in our sample we quantify the impact of the baryons using eta, defined as the ratio of dark matter mass enclosed in 100 pc in the baryonic run to its counterpart without baryons. During this epoch of rapid growth of galaxies, we find that many haloes of these first galaxies show an enhancement of dark matter in the halo centre compared to the baryon-free simulation, while many others show a deficit. We find that the mean value of eta is close to unity, but there is a large dispersion, with a standard deviation of 0.677. The enhancement is cyclical in time and tracks the star formation cycle of the galaxy; as gas falls to the centre and forms stars, the dark matter moves in as well. Supernova feedback then removes the gas, and the dark matter again responds to the changing potential. We study three physical models relating the motion of baryons to that of the dark matter: adiabatic contraction, dynamical friction, and rapid outflows.

Three orbital model for the iron-based superconductors,"The theoretical need to study the properties of the Fe-based high-T_c superconductors with reliable many-body techniques requires us to determine the minimum number of orbital degrees of freedom that will capture the physics of these materials. While the shape of the Fermi surface (FS) obtained with the local density approximation (LDA) can be reproduced by a two-orbital model, it has been argued that the bands that cross the chemical potential result from the strong hybridization of three of the Fe 3d orbitals. For this reason, a three-orbital Hamiltonian obtained with the Slater-Koster formalism by considering the hybridization of the As p orbitals with the Fe d_xz,d_yz, and d_xy orbitals is discussed here. This model reproduces qualitatively the FS shape and orbital composition obtained by LDA calculations for undoped pnictides when four electrons per Fe are considered. Within a mean-field approximation, its magnetic and orbital properties in the undoped case are described. With increasing Coulomb repulsion, four regimes are obtained: (1) paramagnetic, (2) magnetic (pi,0) spin order, (3) the same (pi,0) spin order but now including orbital order, and finally (4) a magnetic and orbital ordered insulator. The spin-singlet pairing operators allowed by the lattice and orbital symmetries are also constructed. It is found that for pairs of electrons involving up to diagonal nearest-neighbors sites, the only fully gapped and purely intraband spin-singlet pairing operator is given by Delta(k)=f(k)\sum_{alpha} d_{k,alpha,up}d_{-k,alpha,down} with f(k)=1 or f(k)=cos(k_x)cos(k_y) which would arise only if the electrons in all different orbitals couple with equal strength to the source of pairing.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Static magnetic and ESR spectroscopic properties of the dimer-chain antiferromagnet BiCoPO$_5$,"We report a comprehensive study of the static susceptibility, high-field magnetization and high-frequency/high-magnetic field electron spin resonance (HF-ESR) spectroscopy of polycrystalline samples of the bismuth cobalt oxy-phosphate BiCoPO$_5$. This compound features a peculiar spin system that can be considered as antiferromagnetic (AFM) chains built of pairs of ferromagnetically coupled Co spins and interconnected in all three spatial directions. It was previously shown that BiCoPO$_5$ orders antiferromagnetically at $T_{\rm N} \approx 10$ K and this order can be continuously suppressed by magnetic field towards the critical value $\mu_0H_{\rm c} \approx 15$ T. In our experiments we find strongly enhanced magnetic moments and spectroscopic $g$ factors as compared to the expected spin-only values, suggesting a strong contribution of orbital magnetism for the Co$^{2+}$ ions. This is quantitatively confirmed by ab initio quantum chemical calculations. Within the AFM ordered phase, we observe a distinct field-induced magnetic phase transition. Its critical field rises to $\sim 6$ T at $T \ll T_{\rm N}$. The HF-ESR spectra recorded at $T\ll T_{\rm N}$ are very rich comprising up to six resonance modes possibly of the multimagnonic nature that soften towards the critical region around 6 T. Interestingly, we find that the Co moments are not yet fully polarized at $H_{\rm c}$ which supports a theoretical proposal identifying $H_{\rm c}$ as the quantum critical point for the transition of the spin system in BiCoPO$_5$ to the quantum disordered state at stronger fields.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
On the radiation energy density in the jet of high-energy emitting BL Lac objects and its impact on their multi-messenger role,"We examine the potential multi-messenger role of BL Lac objects emitting at high energy (so-called HBL) focusing on the limits on the energy density of soft radiation in the jet frame, a critical parameter which regulates the proton cooling and the fragmentation of ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei possibly accelerated in the jet. We show that (under the assumption that the high-energy emission bump is dominated by inverse Compton emission) the energy density of any external soft radiation field (e.g. produced by a layer surrounding the jet or in the accretion flow) cannot be larger than few times that associated to the observed synchrotron radiation produced in the emission region. Quite interestingly, the constraint that we derive is generally stronger than the limit obtained from the condition that the source is transparent to very-high energy $\gamma$-rays. Using this constraint we can derive a robust upper limit for the efficiency of the photopion reaction leading to the emission of PeV neutrinos, $f_{\pi}\lesssim 10^{-5}$, which makes HBL quite inefficient neutrino sources. For the photodisintegration of nuclei the results are more dependent on the spectral properties of the radiation field. The photodisintegration efficiency is safely below 1 (and nuclei can escape intact) for a `canonical' spectrum of the soft radiation field $\propto \nu^{-0.5}$. For radiation fields characterized by a softer spectrum and extended over a large portion of the jet, the efficiency increases and for an appreciable fraction of the sources nuclei with energies above $10^{19}$ eV might suffer significant photodisintegration.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Normal Type Ia supernovae from violent mergers of white dwarf binaries,"One of the most important questions regarding the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is whether mergers of two white dwarfs can lead to explosions that reproduce observations of normal events. Here we present a fully three-dimensional simulation of a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with masses of $0.9 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $1.1 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ combining very high resolution and exact initial conditions. A well-tested combination of codes is used to study the system. We start with the dynamical inspiral phase and follow the subsequent thermonuclear explosion under the plausible assumption that a detonation forms in the process of merging. We then perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and radiative transfer simulations to predict synthetic observables from the homologously expanding supernova ejecta. We find that synthetic color lightcurves of our merger, which produces about $0.62 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, show good agreement with those observed for normal SNe Ia in all wave bands from U to K. Line velocities in synthetic spectra around maximum light also agree well with observations. We conclude, that violent mergers of massive white dwarfs can closely resemble normal SNe Ia. Therefore, depending on the number of such massive systems available these mergers may contribute at least a small fraction to the observed population of normal SNe Ia.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Search for high energy {\gamma}-ray emission from galaxies of the Local Group with Fermi/LAT,"With the discovery of high energy {\gamma}-ray emission from the Andromeda galaxy (M 31) by the Fermi/LAT collaboration, normal galaxies begin to arise from the shadows for the first time, providing insight on cosmic ray acceleration in external galaxies. We search for high energy {\gamma}-ray emission from galaxies in the Local Group which were not investigated so far: M 81, M 83, IC 342, Maffei 1, Maffei 2 and M 94. Fermi/LAT public data from August 4, 2008 to January 1, 2011 were analysed for these galaxies. We compare the results to other starburst and normal galaxies detected at high energies so far: the Magellanic clouds, M 31, and the starburst galaxies M 82 and NGC 253. No significant detection is found in the data for the sources in our sample, and we derive upper limits on their photon flux. Comparing the results to other Local Group objects, we find that the derived upper limits are fully compatible with expectations from cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium within the host galaxies. In the case of M 33 and M 83, a detection in Fermi/LAT data should be imminent. The expected fluxes for the other sources in the sample are below the sensitivity of Fermi/LAT, even after 10 years of observation. Collective emission from compact objects in the host galaxies is also found to be negligible compared to the expected emission from cosmic ray interactions.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Probing Correlations in the Binary Black Hole Population with Flexible Models,"The astrophysical formation channels of binary black hole systems predict correlations between their mass, spin, and redshift distributions, which can be probed with gravitational-wave observations. Population-level analysis of the latest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog of binary black hole mergers has identified evidence for such correlations assuming linear evolution of the mean and width of the effective spin distribution as a function of the binary mass ratio and merger redshift. However, the complex astrophysical processes at play in compact binary formation do not necessarily predict linear relationships between the distributions of these parameters. In this work, we relax the assumption of linearity and instead search for correlations using a more flexible cubic spline model. Our results suggest a nonlinear correlation between the width of the effective spin distribution and redshift. We also show that the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaborations may find convincing Bayesian evidence for nonlinear correlations by the end of the fourth observing run, O4. This highlights the valuable role of flexible models in population analyses of compact-object binaries in the era of growing catalogs.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Saturation model for 2-gamma physics,"We introduce a saturation model for photon-photon interactions, based on a QCD dipole picture of high energy scattering. The two-dipole cross-section is assumed to satisfy the saturation property. This pomeron-like contribution is supplemented with QPM and non-pomeron reggeon contributions. The model gives a very good description of the data on the gamma-gamma total cross-section, on the photon structure function F_2^gamma(x,Q^2) at low x and on the gamma*-gamma* cross-section.",hep,hep-ph,Perturbative QCD versus pion exchange and hadronic FSI effects in the gamma gamma --> pi^+ pi^- reaction,"The interplay of pQCD, pion exchange and FSI effects is studied for the gamma gamma --> pi^+ pi^- reaction in the region of 2 GeV < W_{gamma gamma} < 6 GeV. We find strong interference effects between pQCD and soft pion-exchange amplitudes up to W_{gamma gamma} ~ 4 GeV. We discuss to which extend the conventional hadronic FSI effects could cloud the pQCD effects. We study multipole soft and hard scattering effects as well as the coupling between final state hadronic channels. We show how the perturbative effects in gamma gamma --> rho rho may mix with perturbative effects in gamma gamma --> pi^+ pi^-. The effects discussed in this paper improve the agreement with the new data of the DELPHI and ALEPH collaborations. We give estimates of the onset of the pQCD regime. Predictions for gamma gamma --> pi^0 pi^0 are presented.",hep,hep-ph,1
On the connection between the intergalactic medium and galaxies: The HI-galaxy cross-correlation at z < 1,"We present a new optical spectroscopic survey of 1777 'star-forming' ('SF') and 366 'non-star-forming' ('non-SF') galaxies at redshifts z < 1 (2143 in total), 22 AGN and 423 stars, observed by instruments such as DEIMOS, VIMOS and GMOS, in 3 fields containing 5 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) with HST UV spectroscopy. We also present a new spectroscopic survey of 165 'strong' (10^14 < NHI < 10^17 cm^-2), and 489 'weak' (10^13 < NHI < 10^14 cm^-2) intervening HI absorption line systems at z < 1 (654 in total), observed in the spectra of 8 QSOs by COS and FOS on the HST. Combining these new data with previously published galaxy catalogs such as VVDS and GDDS, we have gathered a sample of 654 HI absorption systems and 17509 galaxies at transverse scales < 50 Mpc. We present observational results on the HI-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy correlations at transverse scales r < 10 Mpc, and the HI-HI auto-correlation at transverse scales r < 2 Mpc. The two-point correlation functions are measured both along and transverse to the line-of-sight. We constrain the HI-galaxy statistical connection, as a function of both HI column density and galaxy star-forming activity. Our results are consistent with the following conclusions: (1) the bulk of HI systems on Mpc scales have little velocity dispersion (<120 km/s) with respect to the bulk of galaxies; (2) the vast majority of strong HI systems and SF galaxies are distributed in the same locations, together with 75+-15% of non-SF galaxies, all of which typically reside in dark matter haloes of similar masses; (3) 25+-15% of non-SF galaxies reside in galaxy clusters and are not correlated with strong HI systems at scales < 2 Mpc; and (4) 50% of weak HI systems reside within galaxy voids (hence not correlated with galaxies), and are confined in dark matter haloes of masses smaller than those hosting...

Fitting for calibration parameters using simultaneous analysis of all Type Ia supernova standard candles achieves a significant improvement over more traditional fit methods. This conclusion is robust under diverse experimental configurations (number of observed supernovae, maximum survey redshift, inclusion of additional systematics). This approach to supernova fitting considerably eases otherwise stringent mission calibration requirements. As an example we simulate a space-based mission based on the proposed JDEM satellite; however the method and conclusions are general and valid for any future supernova dark energy mission, ground or space-based.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Low-energy formulas for neutrino masses with $\tan \beta$-dependent hierarchy,"Using radiative correction and seesaw mechanism,we derive analytic formulas for neutrino masses in SUSY unified theories exhibiting, for the first time, a new hierarchial relation among them.The new hierarchy is found to be quite significant especially for smaller values of $\tan\beta$.",hep,hep-ph,Dark matter and observable Lepton Flavour Violation,"Seesaw models with leptonic symmetries allow right-handed (RH) neutrino masses at the electroweak scale, or even lower, at the same time having large Yukawa couplings with the Standard Model leptons, thus yielding observable effects at current or near-future lepton-flavour-violation (LFV) experiments. These models have been previously considered also in connection to low-scale leptogenesis, but the combination of observable LFV and successful leptogenesis has appeared to be difficult to achieve unless the leptonic symmetry is embedded into a larger one. In this paper, instead, we follow a different route and consider a possible connection between large LFV rates and Dark Matter (DM). We present a model in which the same leptonic symmetry responsible for the large Yukawa couplings guarantees the stability of the DM candidate, identified as the lightest of the RH neutrinos. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry, caused by a Majoron-like field, also provides a mechanism to produce the observed relic density via the decays of the latter. The phenomenological implications of the model are discussed, finding that large LFV rates, observable in the near-future $\mu \to e$ conversion experiments, require the DM mass to be in the keV range. Moreover, the active-neutrino coupling to the Majoron-like scalar field could be probed in future detections of supernova neutrino bursts.",hep,hep-ph,1
Composite Mediators and Lorentz Violation,"We briefly review the history and current status of models of particle interactions in which massless mediators are given, not by fundamental gauge fields as in the Standard Model, but by composite degrees of freedom of fermionic systems. Such models generally require the breaking of Lorentz invariance. We describe schemes in which the photon and the graviton emerge as Goldstone bosons from the breaking of Lorentz invariance, as well as generalizations of the quantum Hall effect in which composite excitations yield massless particles of all integer spins. While these schemes are of limited interest for the photon (spin 1), in the case of the graviton (spin 2) they offer a possible solution to the long-standing UV problem in quantum linear gravity.",hep,hep-th,"Renormalization, Hopf algebras and Mellin transforms","This article aims to give a short introduction into Hopf-algebraic aspects of renormalization, enjoying growing attention for more than a decade by now. As most available literature is concerned with the minimal subtraction scheme, we like to point out properties of the kinematic subtraction scheme which is also widely used in physics (under the names of MOM or BPHZ). In particular we relate renormalized Feynman rules $\phi_R$ in this scheme to the universal property of the Hopf algebra $H_R$ of rooted trees, exhibiting a refined renormalization group equation which is equivalent to $\phi_R: H_R \rightarrow K[x]$ being a morphism of Hopf algebras to the polynomials in one indeterminate. Upon introduction of analytic regularization this results in efficient combinatorial recursions to calculate $\phi_R$ in terms of the Mellin transform. We find that different Feynman rules are related by a distinguished class of Hopf algebra automorphisms of $H_R$ that arise naturally from Hochschild cohomology. Also we recall the known results for the minimal subtraction scheme and shed light on the interrelationship of both schemes. Finally we incorporate combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations to study the effects of renormalization on the physical meaningful correlation functions. This yields a precise formulation of the equivalence of the two different renormalization prescriptions mentioned before and allows for non-perturbative definitions of quantum field theories in special cases.",hep,hep-th,1
Distinct core and halo stellar populations and the formation history of the bright Coma cluster early-type galaxy NGC 4889,"We study the stellar population far into the halo of one of the two brightest galaxies in the Coma cluster, NGC 4889, based on deep medium resolution spectroscopy with FOCAS at the Subaru 8.2m telescope. We fit single stellar population models to the measured line-strength (Lick) indices (Hbeta, Mgb, [MgFe]' and <Fe>). Combining with literature data, we construct radial profiles of metallicity, [alpha/Fe] element abundance ratio and age for NGC 4889, from the center out to ~60 kpc (~4Re). We find evidence for different chemical and star formation histories for stars inside and outside 1.2Re = 18 kpc radius. The inner regions are characterized by a steep [Z/H] gradient and high [alpha/Fe] at ~2.5 times solar value. In the halo, between 18 and 60 kpc, the [Z/H] is near-solar with a shallow gradient, while [alpha/Fe] shows a strong negative gradient, reaching solar values at ~60 kpc. We interpret these data in terms of different formation histories for both components. The data for the inner galaxy are consistent with a rapid, quasi-monolithic, dissipative merger origin at early redshifts, followed by one or at most a few dry mergers. Those for the halo argue for later accretion of stars from old systems with more extended star formation histories. The half-light radius of the inner component alone is estimated as ~6 kpc, suggesting a significantly smaller size of this galaxy in the past. This may be the local stellar population signature of the size evolution found for early-type galaxies from high-redshift observations.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS): X-ray Properties and Scaling Relations of Galaxy Clusters and Groups,"We investigate the scaling relations between X-ray observables of the clusters detected in the eFEDS field using Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma/eROSITA observations taking into account the selection effects and the distributions of observables with cosmic time. We extract X-ray observables (Lx, Lbol, T, Mgas, Yx) within R500 for the sample of 542 clusters in the eFEDS field. By applying detection and extent likelihoods, we construct a subsample of 265 clusters with a contamination level of <10% (including AGNs and spurious fluctuations) to be utilized in the scaling relation analysis. The selection function based on the state-of-the-art simulations of the eROSITA sky is fully accounted for in our work. We provide the X-ray observables in the core-included <R500 and core-excised 0.15*R500-R500 apertures for 542 galaxy clusters and groups detected in the eFEDS field. Additionally, we present our best-fit results for the normalization, slope, redshift evolution and intrinsic scatter parameters of the X-ray scaling relations between Lx-T, Lx-Mgas, Lx-Yx, Lbol-T, Lbol-Mgas, Lbol-Yx and Mgas-T. We find that the best-fit slopes significantly deviate from the self-similar model at a >3sigma confidence level however, our results are in good agreement with the simulations including non-gravitational physics and the recent results that take into account selection effects. Strong deviations we find from the self-similar scenario indicate that the non-gravitational effects play an important role in shaping the observed physical state of clusters. This work extends the scaling relations to low mass, low luminosity galaxy cluster and group regime using eFEDS observations, demonstrating eROSITA's ability to measure ICM emission out to R500 with survey-depth exposures and constrain the scaling relations in a wide mass-luminosity-redshift range.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Non-Equilibrium Quantum Dissipation,"Dissipative processes in non-equilibrium many-body systems are fundamentally different than their equilibrium counterparts. Such processes are of great importance for the understanding of relaxation in single molecule devices. As a detailed case study, we investigate here a generic spin-fermion model, where a two-level system couples to two metallic leads with different chemical potentials. We present results for the spin relaxation rate in the nonadiabatic limit for an arbitrary coupling to the leads, using both analytical and exact numerical methods. The non-equilibrium dynamics is reflected by an exponential relaxation at long times and via complex phase shifts, leading in some cases to an ""anti-orthogonality"" effect. In the limit of strong system-lead coupling at zero temperature we demonstrate the onset of a Marcus-like Gaussian decay with {\it voltage difference} activation. This is analogous to the equilibrium spin-boson model, where at strong coupling and high temperatures the spin excitation rate manifests temperature activated Gaussian behavior. We find that there is no simple linear relationship between the role of the temperature in the bosonic system and a voltage drop in a non-equilibrium electronic case. The two models also differ by the orthogonality-catastrophe factor existing in a fermionic system, which modifies the resulting lineshapes. Implications for current characteristics are discussed. We demonstrate the violation of pair-wise Coulomb gas behavior for strong coupling to the leads. The results presented in this paper form the basis of an exact, non-perturbative description of steady-state quantum dissipative systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Optimal control of circuit quantum electrodynamics in one and two dimensions,"Optimal control can be used to significantly improve multi-qubit gates in quantum information processing hardware architectures based on superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics. We apply this approach not only to dispersive gates of two qubits inside a cavity, but, more generally, to architectures based on two-dimensional arrays of cavities and qubits. For high-fidelity gate operations, simultaneous evolutions of controls and couplings in the two coupling dimensions of cavity grids are shown to be significantly faster than conventional sequential implementations. Even under experimentally realistic conditions speedups by a factor of three can be gained. The methods immediately scale to large grids and indirect gates between arbitrary pairs of qubits on the grid. They are anticipated to be paradigmatic for 2D arrays and lattices of controllable qubits.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
X-ray microtomography of heavy microstructures: the case of Plasma-Sprayed Tungsten and Tungsten-Steel MMC,"In this paper synchrotron microtomography on Plasma Sprayed Tungsten (PS-W) is presented and discussed. PS-W is a challenging material for microtomography since it exhibits a random porous network at different length-scales (from nanometers to micrometers) and is hardly penetrable by X-rays. Furthermore, inner porosity causes strong internal scattering. The key challenges were, firstly, to optimize the beam parameters considering the inherent trade-off between photon energy (penetration depth) and spatial resolution and, secondly, to develop effective signal filtering algorithms. Despite the limited signal-to-noise ratio detected, large volumes of PS-W could be reconstructed with good image quality and micrometric resolution (voxel size = 1.4 {\mu}m). As an important result, we report excellent image quality and higher penetration depth by applying the same setup on a ferrous microstructure, namely a 10%W/Steel MMC used as interlayer between PS-W and a ferritic/martensitic steel substrate. The paper reports a detailed 3D morphological analysis of all inclusion types in PS-W and W/Steel, which led to disclosure of a complex connected porous network in both media. The analysis is presented in terms of multiphase volume fraction, ratio of percolation and 3D shape descriptors. 3D percolation patterns are analyzed in detail and sensitivity towards segmentation threshold for the noise-affected PS-W region is discussed. Remarkably, percolation of the porous phase was found throughout the entire coating thickness of PS-W. In W-Steel MMC percolation was found in the perpendicular plane and interpreted as onset of delamination caused by thermomechanical stress.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"Magnetic anisotropy of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films studied by Fe and Pt $L_{2,3}$-edges x-ray magnetic circular dichroism","The strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of $L{\rm1_0}$-ordered FePt has been the subject of extensive studies for a long time. However, it is not known which element, Fe or Pt, mainly contributes to the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). We have investigated the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moments of Fe 3$d$ and Pt 5$d$ electrons in $L{\rm1_0}$-ordered FePt thin films by Fe and Pt $L_{2,3}$-edge x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements for samples with various degrees of long-range chemical order $S$. Fe $L_{2,3}$-edge XMCD showed that the orbital magnetic moment was larger when the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the film than parallel to it, and that the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment increased with $S$. Pt $L_{2,3}$-edge XMCD also showed that the orbital magnetic moment was smaller when the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the film than parallel to it, opposite to the Fe $L_{2,3}$-edge XMCD results although the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment increases with $S$ like the Fe edge. These results are qualitatively consistent with the first-principles calculation by Solovyev ${\it et\ al.}$ [Phys. Rev. B $\bf{52}$, 13419 (1995).], which also predicts the dominant contributions of Pt 5$d$ to the magnetic anisotropy energy rather than Fe 3$d$ due to the strong spin-orbit coupling and the small spin splitting of the Pt 5$d$ bands in $L{\rm1_0}$-ordered FePt.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Relative Grain Boundary Energies from Triple Junction Geometry: Limitations to Assuming the Herring Condition in Nanocrystalline Thin Films,"Grain boundary character distributions (GBCD) are routinely measured from bulk microcrystalline samples by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and serial sectioning can be used to reconstruct relative grain boundary energy distributions (GBED) based on the 3D geometry of triple lines, assuming that the Herring condition of force balance is satisfied. These GBEDs correlate to those predicted from molecular dynamics (MD); furthermore, the GBCD and GBED are found to be inversely correlated. For nanocrystalline thin films, orientation mapping via precession enhanced electron diffraction (PED) has proven effective in measuring the GBCD, but the GBED has not been extracted. Here, the established relative energy extraction technique is adapted to PED data from four sputter deposited samples: a 40 nm-thick tungsten film and a 100 nm aluminum film as-deposited, after 30 and after 150 minutes annealing at 400{\deg}C. These films have columnar grain structures, so serial sectioning is not required to determine boundary inclination. Excepting the most energetically anisotropic and highest population boundaries, i.e. aluminum {\Sigma}3 boundaries, the relative GBED extracted from these data do not correlate with energies calculated using MD nor do they inversely correlate with the experimentally determined GBCD for either the tungsten or aluminum films. Failure to reproduce predicted energetic trends implies that the conventional Herring equation cannot be applied to determine relative GBEDs and thus geometries at triple junctions in these films are not well described by this condition; additional geometric factors must contribute to determining triple junction geometry and boundary network structure in spatially constrained, polycrystalline materials.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Defect Properties of Na and K in Cu2ZnSnS4 from Hybrid Functional Calculation,"In-growth or post-deposition treatment of $Cu_{2}ZnSnS_{4}$ (CZTS) absorber layer had led to improved photovoltaic efficiency, however, the underlying physical mechanism of such improvements are less studied. In this study, the thermodynamics of Na and K related defects in CZTS are investigated from first principle approach using hybrid functional, with chemical potential of Na and K established from various phases of their polysulphides. Both Na and K predominantly substitute on Cu sites similar to their behavior in $Cu(In,Ga)Se_{2}$, in contrast to previous results using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). All substitutional and interstitial defects are shown to be either shallow levels or highly energetically unfavorable. Defect complexing between Na and abundant intrinsic defects did not show possibility of significant incorporation enhancement or introducing deep n-type levels. The possible benefit of Na incorporation on enhancing photovoltaic efficiency is discussed. The negligible defect solubility of K in CZTS also suggests possible surfactant candidate.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Nanoscale probing of image-potential states and electron transfer doping in borophene polymorphs,"Using field-emission resonance spectroscopy with an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope, we reveal Stark-shifted image-potential states of the v_1/6 and v_1/5 borophene polymorphs on Ag(111) with long lifetimes, suggesting high borophene lattice and interface quality. These image-potential states allow the local work function and interfacial charge transfer of borophene to be probed at the nanoscale and test the widely employed self-doping model of borophene. Supported by apparent barrier height measurements and density functional theory calculations, electron transfer doping occurs for both borophene phases from the Ag(111) substrate. In contradiction with the self-doping model, a higher electron transfer doping level occurs for denser v_1/6 borophene compared to v_1/5 borophene, thus revealing the importance of substrate effects on borophene electron transfer.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Switching the magnetic configuration of a spin valve by current induced domain wall motion,"We present experimental results on the displacement of a domain wall by injection of a dc current through the wall. The samples are 1 micron wide long stripes of a CoO/Co/Cu/NiFe classical spin valve structure. The stripes have been patterned by electron beam lithography. A neck has been defined at 1/3 of the total length of the stripe and is a pinning center for the domain walls, as shown by the steps of the giant magnetoresistance curves at intermediate levels (1/3 or 2/3) between the resistances corresponding to the parallel and antiparallel configurations. We show by electric transport measurements that, once a wall is trapped, it can be moved by injecting a dc current higher than a threshold current of the order of magnitude of 10^7 A/cm^2. We discuss the different possible origins of this effect, i.e. local magnetic field created by the current and/or spin transfer from spin polarized current.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
The D0 Detector at TeV33,"The physics that can be done with 30 fb$^{-1}$ of data at the Tevatron (TeV33) will significantly advance our understanding of particle physics.

We show that the DO detector will perform well with some relatively modest modifications.",hep,hep-ex,A Time Projection Chamber with GEM-Based Readout,"For the International Large Detector concept at the planned International Linear Collider, the use of time projection chambers (TPC) with micro-pattern gas detector readout as the main tracking detector is investigated.

Dust depleted inner disks in a large sample of transition disks through long-baseline ALMA observations,"Transition disks with large inner dust cavities are thought to host massive companions. However, the disk structure inside the companion orbit and how material flows toward an actively accreting star remain unclear. We present a high resolution continuum study of inner disks in the cavities of 38 transition disks. Measurements of the dust mass from archival Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations are combined with stellar properties and spectral energy distributions to assemble a detailed picture of the inner disk. An inner dust disk is detected in 18 of 38 disks in our sample. Of the 14 resolved disks, 9 are significantly misaligned with the outer disk. The near-infrared excess is uncorrelated with the mm dust mass of the inner disk. The size-luminosity correlation known for protoplanetary disks is recovered for the inner disks as well, consistent with radial drift. The inner disks are depleted in dust relative to the outer disk and their dust mass is uncorrelated with the accretion rates. This is interpreted as the result of radial drift and trapping by planets in a low $\alpha$ ($\sim 10^{-3}$) disk, or a failure of the $\alpha$-disk model to describe angular momentum transport and accretion. The only disk in our sample with confirmed planets in the gap, PDS 70, has an inner disk with a significantly larger radius and lower inferred gas-to-dust ratio than other disks in the sample. We hypothesize that these inner disk properties and the detection of planets are due to the gap having only been opened recently by young, actively accreting planets.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,Observational signatures of the giant planets collisions,"We consider observational signatures of the collisions and partial destructions of giant exoplanets at the chaotic stage of the planetary systems evolution. The rate of these collisions in the Galaxy is estimated to be ~0.01-1 per yr. In the inelastic collision with a small relative velocity and small impact parameter, the planets may sufficiently lose their kinetic energy and merge together. Otherwise, if the planet is experienced a shallow tangential collision, it flews safety away. At the same time, the planets loss some part of their gas envelopes during mutual collisions. Collisions of the giant planets must be accompanied also by the radiation of energy from the radio to optical bands. The optical and near UV flashes result from the collision heating of the planet surface layers. Additionally, the collision compression and collapse of the powerful magnetosphere of giant planets are possible, with a successive generation of the radio bursts. According to our estimations, the corresponding rate the radio bursts is ~0.01-1 bursts per year with the maximum spectral flux ~30mJy at the frequencies ~3GHz and with a duration of the each burst ~1.5 hours. These signals are available for registration by the existing radio telescopes.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,1
Cosmic Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy,"Gamma-ray instrumentation for astronomical spectroscopy consists of multiple-interaction detectors in space combined with sophisticated post-processing of detector events on ground. Spectral signatures in the MeV regime originate from transitions in the nuclei of atoms (rather than in their electron shell). Nuclear transitions are stimulated by either radioactive decays or high-energy nuclear collisions such as with cosmic rays. Gamma-ray lines have been detected from radioactive isotopes produced in nuclear burning inside stars and supernovae, and from energetic-particle interactions in solar flares. 56Ni directly reflects the source of supernova light. The paucity of corresponding 44Ti gamma-ray line sources reflects the variety of dynamical conditions herein. 26Al and 60Fe are dispersed in interstellar space from massive-star nucleosynthesis over millions of years. Gamma-rays from their decay are measured in detail by gamma-ray telescopes, astrophysical interpretations reach from massive-star interiors to dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Nuclear de-excitation gamma-ray lines have been found in solar-flare events, and convey information about energetic-particle production in these events, and their interaction in the solar atmosphere. The annihilation of positrons leads to another type of cosmic gamma-ray source. The characteristic annihilation gamma-rays at 511 keV have been measured long ago in solar flares, and now throughout the interstellar medium of our Milky Way galaxy. But now a puzzle has appeared, as a surprising predominance of the central bulge region was determined. This requires either new positron sources or transport processes not yet known to us.

We investigate 2013 multifrequency positions under the eyes of Fermi Large Area Telescope, considering 11 years of observations in the energy range between 500 MeV to 500 GeV, which results in 1160 $\rm \gamma$-ray signatures detected down to the TS = 9 threshold. The detections include 235 additional sources concerning the Fermi Large Area Telescope Fourth Source Catalog (4FGL), all confirmed via high-energy TS maps, and represent an improvement of ~25% for the number of EHSP & HSP currently described in $\rm \gamma$-rays. We build the $\rm \gamma$-ray spectral energy distribution for all the 1160 2BIGB sources, plot the corresponding $\rm \gamma$-ray logN-logS, and measure their total contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background, which reaches up to ~33% at 100 GeV. Also, we show that the $\rm \gamma$-ray detectability improves according to the synchrotron peak flux as represented by the Figure of Merit (FOM) parameter, and note that the search for TeV peaked blazars may benefit from considering HSP and EHSP as a whole, instead of EHSPs only.

Annular billiard dynamics in a circularly polarized strong laser field,"We analyze the dynamics of a valence electron of the buckminsterfullerene molecule (C60) subjected to a circularly polarized laser field by modeling it with the motion of a classical particle in an annular billiard. We show that the phase space of the billiard model gives rise to three distinct trajectories: ""Whispering gallery orbits"", which only hit the outer billiard wall, ""daisy orbits"" which hit both billiard walls (while rotating solely clockwise or counterclockwise for all time), and orbits which only visit the downfield part of the billiard, as measured relative to the laser term. These trajectories, in general, maintain their distinct features, even as intensity is increased from 10^10 to 10^14 W*cm^-2. We attribute this robust separation of phase space to the existence of twistless tori.",physics,physics.atom-ph,Effective unidirectional pumping for steady-state amplification without inversion,"We discuss an opportunity to achieve amplification without inversion in three-level cascade scheme using an effective unidirectional pumping via bidirectional incoherent pump.

Technical Note: MC-GPU breast dosimetry validations with other Monte Carlo codes and Phase Space File implementation,"Purpose: To validate the MC-GPU Monte Carlo code for dosimetric studies in x-ray breast imaging modalities: mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, contrast enhanced digital mammography and breast-CT. Moreover, to implement and validate a phase space file generation routine. Methods: The MC-GPU code (v. 1.5 DBT) was modified in order to generate phase space files and to be compatible with PENELOPE v. 2018 derived cross section database. Simulations were performed with homogeneous and anthropomorphic breast phantoms for different breast imaging techniques. The glandular dose was computed for each case and compared with results from the PENELOPE (v. 2014) + penEasy (v. 2015) and egs brachy (EGSnrc) Monte Carlo codes. Afterwards, several phase space files were generated with MC-GPU and the scored photon spectra were compared between the codes. Results: MC-GPU showed good agreement with the other codes when calculating the glandular dose distribution for mammography, mean glandular dose for digital breast tomosynthesis, and normalized glandular dose for breast-CT. The latter case showed average/maximum relative differences of 2.3%/27%, respectively, compared to other literature works, with the larger differences observed at low energies (around 10 keV). The recorded photon spectra entering a voxel were similar (within statistical uncertainties) between the three Monte Carlo codes. Conclusions: The results indicate that MC-GPU code is suitable for breast dosimetric studies for different x-ray breast imaging modalities, with the advantage of a high performance. The phase space file implementation was validated and is compatible with the IAEA standard, allowing multiscale Monte Carlo simulations with a combination of CPU and GPU codes.",physics,physics.med-ph,Unsupervised Learning Methods in X-ray Spectral Imaging Material Segmentation,"In this work, we have investigated a number of unsupervised learning methods for material segmentation in projection x-ray imaging with a spectral detector. A phantom containing two hard materials (glass, steel) and three soft materials (PVC, polypropylene, and PFTE) all embedded in PMMA was imaged with a 5 energy bin spectal detector. The projection images were utilized to test nine unsupervised learning algorithms for automated material segmentation. Each algorithm was investigated using single energy (SE), dual energy (DE) and multi energy (ME) images. Clustering results were scored based on homogeneity and completeness of the clusters, which were combined into the Rosenberg and Hirshberg's V-measure. Principle component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) were tested as dimensional reduction methods. ME, DE and SE material segmentation was performed using five, two, and single energy images, respectively. ME had the highest V-measure on the soft materials using PCA and a novel interpolating bayesian gaussian mixture model (BGMM) clustering with a V-measure of 0.71. This was by 3.5% better than DE and 20.3% better than SE. Conversely, SE imaging was most capable of hard tissue segmentation using the standard BGMM, with a V-measures of 0.84. This was 6.3% better than DE and 5.0% better than ME. This work demonstrated that ME x-ray imaging might be superior in segmenting soft tissues compared to conventional SE x-ray imaging.",physics,physics.med-ph,1
Bounds on Regge growth of flat space scattering from bounds on chaos,"We study four-point functions of scalars, conserved currents, and stress tensors in a conformal field theory, generated by a local contact term in the bulk dual description, in two different causal configurations. The first of these is the standard Regge configuration in which the chaos bound applies. The second is the `causally scattering configuration' in which the correlator develops a bulk point singularity. We find an expression for the coefficient of the bulk point singularity in terms of the bulk S matrix of the bulk dual metric, gauge fields and scalars, and use it to determine the Regge scaling of the correlator on the causally scattering sheet in terms of the Regge growth of this S matrix. We then demonstrate that the Regge scaling on this sheet is governed by the same power as in the standard Regge configuration, and so is constrained by the chaos bound, which turns out to be violated unless the bulk flat space S matrix grows no faster than $s^2$ in the Regge limit. It follows that in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the chaos bound applied to the boundary field theory implies that the S matrices of the dual bulk scalars, gauge fields, and gravitons obey the Classical Regge Growth (CRG) conjecture.",hep,hep-th,Hidden conformal symmetry for dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole and its gauged family,"Motivated by advanced progress in the holographic theory between rotating black holes and CFT, we explore the conformal invariance on dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole and its gauged family. We consider a neutral massless scalar probe on the black holes' background within the low-frequency limit and exhibit that the solution space possesses $SL(2,R)\times SL(2,R)$ isometry. The periodic identification of the azimuthal angle corresponds to the spontaneous conformal symmetry breaking by temperatures $T_L,T_R$. Using the computation of the central charges on Ref. [25] that we recalculate by considering the contributions of all associated fields, we successfully derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy from Cardy entropy formula. Furthermore, we also calculate the absorption cross-section from gravity side for generic non-extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole and near-extremal gauged dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole. Our calculations show that those quantities are in a perfect match with the calculation from CFT. Therefore, our findings further support the duality between rotating black holes and CFTs.",hep,hep-th,1
Spin and pseudospin towers of the Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice,"In 1989, Lieb proved two theorems about the Hubbard model. One showed that the ground state of the attractive model was a spin singlet state ($S=0$), was unique, and was positive definite. The other showed that the ground state of the repulsive model on a bipartite lattice at half-filling has a total spin given by $|(N_A-N_B)/2|$, corresponding to the difference of the number of lattice sites on the two sublattices divided by two. In the mid to late 1990's, Shen extended these proofs to show that the pseudospin of the attractive model was minimal until the electron number equaled $2N_A$ where it became fixed at $J=|(N_A-N_B)/2|$ until the filling became $2N_B$, where it became minimal again. In addition, Shen showed that a spin tower exists for the spin eigenstates for the half-filled case on a bipartite lattice. The spin tower says the minimal energy state with spin $S$ is higher in energy than the minimal energy state with spin $S-1$ until we reach the ground-state spin given above. One long standing conjecture about this model remains, namely does the attractive model have such a spin tower for all fillings, which would then imply that the repulsive model has minimal pseudopsin in its ground state. While we do not prove this last conjecture, we provide a quick review of this previous work, provide a constructive proof of the pseudospin of the attractive model ground state, and describe the challenges with proving the remaining open conjecture.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Magnon-phonon coupling effects on the indirect K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectrum of a 2D Heisenberg antiferromagnet,"We compute the effects of magnon-phonon coupling on the indirect K-edge bimagnon resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) intensity spectrum of a square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We analyze the effects of competing nearest and next--nearest magnetic and magnon-phonon coupling interaction in the RIXS spectrum, for both the antiferromagnetic (AF) and the collinear antiferromagnetic (CAF) phases of the model. Utilizing the Dyson-Maleev representation of spin operators, the Bethe-Salpeter ladder approximation scheme for the bimagnon interacting channel, and considering the lowest order magnon-phonon-magnon scattering interaction we highlight distinct features in the X-ray spectrum. Considering damping effects, arising due to the presence of phonons, we find that in the AF phase the RIXS intensity spectrum attains a maximum value primarily localized around the K $\left(\pm\frac{\pi}{2}, \pm \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ - point. For the CAF phase the intensity is broadly distributed with a significant scattering intensity located around the Y $\left(\pm\frac{\pi}{2}, 0\right)$ - point. Furthermore, in the CAF phase for suitable anisotropy, nearest-, and next-nearest neighbor interaction parameters the phonon effects can manifest itself as a distinct peak both below and above the bimagnon peak. Such a feature is in contrast to the antiferromagnetic spectrum where the effect due to the phonon peak was located consistently beyond the bimagnon peak in the high energy end of the spectrum. Additionally, in the CAF phase we find the RIXS bimagnon-phonon spectrum to be more sensitive to anisotropy compared to its antiferromagnetic counterpart. We conclude that the ultimate effect of magnon-phonon effects in the indirect K-edge RIXS spectrum, in both the antiferromagnetic and the collinear antiferromagnetic phase, is an observable effect.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Is High-density Amorphous Ice Simply a 'Derailed' State along the Ice I to Ice IV Pathway?,"The structural nature of high-density amorphous ice (HDA), which forms through low-temperature pressure-induced amorphization of the 'ordinary' ice I, is heavily debated. Clarifying this question is not only important for understanding the complex condensed states of H$_2$O but also in the wider context of pressure-induced amorphization processes, which are encountered across the entire materials spectrum. We first show that ammonium fluoride (NH$_4$F), which has a similar hydrogen-bonded network to ice I, also undergoes a pressure collapse upon compression at 77 K. However, the product material is not amorphous but NH$_4$F II, a high-pressure phase isostructural with ice IV. This collapse can be rationalized in terms of a highly effective mechanism. In the case of ice I, the orientational disorder of the water molecules leads to a deviation from this mechanism and we therefore classify HDA as a 'derailed' state along the ice I to ice IV pathway.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Cleaving-temperature dependence of layered-oxide surfaces,"The surfaces generated by cleaving non-polar, two-dimensional oxides are often considered to be perfect or ideal. However, single particle spectroscopies on Sr2RuO4, an archetypal non-polar two dimensional oxide, show significant cleavage temperature dependence. We demonstrate that this is not a consequence of the intrinsic characteristics of the surface: lattice parameters and symmetries, step heights, atom positions, or density of states. Instead, we find a marked increase in the density of defects at the mesoscopic scale with increased cleave temperature. The potential generality of these defects to oxide surfaces may have broad consequences to interfacial control and the interpretation of surface sensitive measurements.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
The scaling relations of galaxies back in time: the road toward virialization,"Context. The structural scaling relations (SSRs) of galaxies, i.e. the observed correlations between effective radius, effective surface intensity and velocity dispersion, are important tools for understanding how evolution proceeds. Aims. In this paper we aim to demonstrate that the evolution of the SSRs back in time is governed by the combination of the virial theorem (VT) and the relation $L=L'_0 \sigma^{\beta(t)}$, where the parameters $\beta$ and $L'_0$ vary with time and from galaxy to galaxy. Methods. Using the WINGS database for the galaxies at redshift $z=0$ and the Illustris-1 and Illustris-TNG databases of artificial galaxies, for the galaxies up to redshift $z=4$, we analyse the SSRs back in time and, by means of simple algebraic expressions for $L'_0$ and $\beta$ (functions of time and other physical quantities), we derive the expected paths followed by galaxies in the various SSRs toward the distributions observed at $z=0$. Results. The distribution of galaxies in the SSRs is ultimately related to the evolution in luminosity and velocity dispersion that are empirically mirrored by the $L=L'_0 \sigma^{\beta(t)}$ law. Furthermore, the $\beta$ parameter works as a thermometer of the virialization of a galaxy. This parameter can assume either positive or negative values, and its absolute value attains high values when the galaxy is close to the virial condition, while it tends to zero when the galaxy is far from it. Conclusions. As the SSRs change with time, the method we are proposing allows us to decipher the temporal evolution of galaxies.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Multi-epoch properties of the warm absorber in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 985,"(Abridged) NGC 985 was observed by XMM-Newton twice in 2015, revealing that the source was coming out from a soft X-ray obscuration event that took place in 2013. These kinds of events are possibly recurrent since a previous XMM-Newton archival observation in 2003 also showed signatures of partial obscuration. We have analyzed the high-resolution X-ray spectra of NGC 985 obtained by the RGS in 2003, 2013, and 2015 in order to characterize the ionized absorbers superimposed to the continuum and to study their response as the ionizing flux varies. We found that up to four warm absorber (WA) components were present in the grating spectra of NGC 985, plus a mildy ionized (log xi ranging between 0.2 and 0.5) obscuring (log N(H) of about 22.3) wind outflowing at about 6000 km/s. The absorbers have a log N(H) ranging from 21 to about 22.5, and ionization parameters ranging from 1.6 to 2.9. The most ionized component is also the fastest, moving away at 5100 km/s, while the others outflow in two kinematic regimes, at about 600 and 350 km/s. These components showed variability at different time scales in response to changes in the ionizing continuum. Assuming that these changes are due to photoionization we have obtained upper and lower limits on the density of the gas and therefore on its distance, finding that the closest two components are at pc-scale distances, while the rest may extend up to tens of pc from the central source. The fastest, most ionized WA component accounts for the bulk of the kinetic luminosity injected back into the ISM of the host galaxy, which is on the order of 0.8% of the bolometric luminosity of NGC 985. According to the models, this amount of kinetic energy per unit time would be sufficient to account for cosmic feedback.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Flavor structure of the baryon-baryon interaction from lattice QCD,"We investigate baryon-baryon (BB) interactions in the 3-flavor full QCD simulations with degenerate quark masses for all flavors. The BB potentials in the orbital S-wave are extracted from the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter wave functions measured on the lattice. We observe strong flavor-spin dependences of the BB potentials at short distances. In particular, a strong repulsive core exists in the flavor-octet and spin-singlet channel(the 8_s representation), while an attractive core appears in the flavor singlet channel (the 1 representation). We discuss the relation of such flavor-spin dependence with the Pauli exclusion principle at the quark level. The possible existence of an H-dibaryon resonance above the Lambda-Lambda threshold is also discussed.",nucl,nucl-th,Elastic scattering measurements for the $^{10}$C + $^{208}$Pb system at E$_{\rm lab}$ = 66 MeV,"Background: The influence of halo structure of $^6$He, $^8$B, $^{11}$Be and $^{11}$Li nuclei in several mechanisms such as direct reactions and fusion is already established, although not completely understood. The influence of the $^{10}$C Brunnian structure is less known. Purpose: To investigate the influence of the cluster configuration of $^{10}$C on the elastic scattering at an energy close to the Coulomb barrier. Methods: We present experimental data for the elastic scattering of the $^{10}$C+$^{208}$Pb system at $E_{\rm lab}$ = 66 MeV. The data are compared to the three- and the four-body continuum-discretized coupled-channels calculations assuming $^9$B+$p$, $^6$Be+$\alpha$ and $^8$Be+$p$+$p$ configurations. Results: The experimental angular distribution of the cross sections shows the suppression of the Fresnel peak that is reasonably well reproduced by the continuum-discretized coupled-channels calculations. However, the calculations underestimate the cross sections at backward angles. Couplings to continuum states represent a small effect. Conclusions: The cluster configurations of $^{10}$C assumed in the present work are able to describe some of the features of the data. In order to explain the data at backward angles, experimental data for the breakup and an extension of theoretical formalism towards a four-body cluster seem to be in need to reproduce the measured angular distribution.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Superconductivity in monolayer and few-layer graphene: I. Review of possible pairing symmetries and basic electronic properties,"We review all symmetry-allowed spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconducting (SC) order parameters in graphene ($s$-wave, $d$-wave, $p$-wave, and $f$-wave) generated by generic onsite, nearest-neighbor (NN), and next-to-nearest-neighbor (NNN) pairing interactions in a tight-binding model. For each pairing channel, we calculate both the band structure and the dependence of the density of states on energy, chemical potential, and on the pairing strength. In particular, we distinguish between nodal superconducting states and fully gapped states and study the dependence of gap closing points on the chemical potential and the superconducting pairing strength. We further investigate the difference between mono-, bi-, and tri-layer ABC and ABA graphene, including accounting for the effects of trigonal warping.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,Vortex interaction in thin films -- a crossover from type I to type II superconductivity,"Interactions between vortices in thin superconducting films are investigated in the crossover (intertype) regime between superconductivity types I and II. We consider two main factors responsible for this crossover: a) changes in the material characteristics of the film and b) variations of the film thickness controlling the effect of the stray magnetic fields outside superconducting sample. The analysis is done within the formalism that combines the perturbation expansion of the microscopic equations to one order beyond the Ginzburg-Landau theory with the leading contribution of the stray fields. It is shown that the latter gives rise to qualitatively different spatial profile and temperature dependence of the vortex interaction potential, as compared to bulk vortex interactions. The resulting interaction is long-range repulsive while exhibiting complex competition of attraction and repulsion at small and intermediate separations of vortices. This explains the appearance of vortex chains reported earlier for superconducting films.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,1
Transient Exchange Interaction in a Helical Antiferromagnet,We have performed time-resolved resonant x-ray scattering studies in the Lanthanide metal Dy to reveal the dynamic response of the helical order exchange coupling to injection of unpolarized spins. The observed spin dynamics are significantly slower than that exhibited by the ferromagnetic phase in Lanthanide metals and are strongly dependent on temperature and excitation fluence.

On the transition temperature(s) of magnetized two-flavour holographic QCD,"During heavy ion collisions, high temperatures and strong magnetic fields are generated. We employ the gauge-gravity duality to study the N_f=2 QCD phase diagram under these extreme conditions in the quenched approximation, in particular we use the non-antipodal Sakai-Sugimoto model (SSM). We take the different coupling of up and down flavours to the magnetic field into account geometrically, resulting in a split of the chiral phase transition according to flavour. We discuss the influence of the magnetic field on the chiral temperatures -in physical GeV units- in terms of the choice of the confinement scale in the model, extending hereby our elsewhere presented discussion of fixing the non-antipodal SSM parameters to the deconfinement phase. The flavour-dependent (T,L,eB) phase diagram, with variable asymptotic brane-antibrane separation L, is also presented, as a direct generalization of the known (T,L) phase diagram of the non-antipodal SSM at zero magnetic field. In particular, for sufficiently small L we are probing a NJL-like boundary field theory in which case we do find results very reminiscent of the predictions in NJL models.",hep,hep-ph,Using quasar X-ray and UV flux measurements to constrain cosmological model parameters,"Risaliti and Lusso have compiled X-ray and UV flux measurements of 1598 quasars (QSOs) in the redshift range $0.036 \leq z \leq 5.1003$, part of which, $z \sim 2.4 - 5.1$, is largely cosmologically unprobed. In this paper we use these QSO measurements, alone and in conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, to constrain cosmological parameters in six different cosmological models, each with two different Hubble constant priors. In most of these models, given the larger uncertainties, the QSO cosmological parameter constraints are mostly consistent with those from the $H(z)$ + BAO data. A somewhat significant exception is the non-relativistic matter density parameter $\Omega_{m0}$ where the QSO data favors $\Omega_{m0} \sim 0.5 - 0.6$ in most models. Consequently in joint analyses of QSO data with $H(z)$ + BAO data the one-dimensional $\Omega_{m0}$ distributions shift slightly toward larger values. A joint analysis of the QSO + $H(z)$ + BAO data is consistent with the current standard model, spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM, but mildly favors closed spatial hypersurfaces and dynamical dark energy. Since the higher $\Omega_{m0}$ values favored by the QSO data appear to be associated with the $z \sim 2 - 5$ part of these data, and conflict somewhat with strong indications for $\Omega_{m0} \sim 0.3$ from most $z < 2.5$ data as well as from the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data at $z \sim 1100$, in most models, the larger QSO data $\Omega_{m0}$ is possibly more indicative of an issue with the $z \sim 2 - 5$ QSO data than of an inadequacy of the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model.",hep,hep-ph,1
CP violation in $B^{\pm} \rightarrow \pi^{\pm}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ in the region with low invariant mass of one $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pair,"Recently, the large CP asymmetries in $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm\pi^+\pi^-$ decays were found by the LHCb Collaboration to localize in the region $m_{\pi^+\pi^-}^2<0.4 \text{GeV}^2$. We find such large localized CP asymmetries may be due to the interference between a light scalar and $\rho^0(770)$ intermediate resonances. Consequently, we argue that the distribution of CP asymmetries in the Dalitz plots of three-body B decays could be very helpful for identifying the presence of the scalar resonance.",hep,hep-ph,A new determination of the charm mass from the non-analytic reconstruction of the heavy quark correlator,"Using the new non-analytic reconstruction method obtained from Mellin-Barnes properties, one can extract the value $m_c(\bar{\text{MS}}) = 1.12 \pm 0.08 \;\; \text{GeV}$ from experimental data of the radiation-corrected measured hadronic cross section to the calculated lowest-order cross section for muon pair production in the heavy-quark approximation.",hep,hep-ph,1
What is the right formalism to search for resonances? II. The pentaquark chain,"We discuss the differences between several partial-wave analysis formalisms used in the construction of three-body decay amplitudes involving fermions. Specifically, we consider the decay Lambda_b -> psi p K- , where the hidden charm pentaquark signal has been reported. We analyze the analytical properties of the amplitudes and separate kinematical and dynamical singularities. The result is an amplitude with the minimal energy dependence compatible with the S-matrix principles.",hep,hep-ex,Charm Physics at CDF II,"The CDF II detector has the capability of triggering on displaced tracks. Because of this ability, CDF II has accrued large samples of charmed meson decays to fully hadronic final states in 64 pb^-1 of ppbar collision data gathered at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. Using initial Run II data samples, the production cross sections for J/psi, D0, D+, D*+ and Ds+ mesons have been measured. Ratios of branching ratios for Cabibbo suppressed final states and CP asymmetries in D0 meson decays have been studied. A measurement of the mass difference m(Ds+) - m(D+) has been done, and a limit for the branching fraction of the FCNC D0 -> mu+ mu- decays has been set.",hep,hep-ex,1
Condensate fraction in a 2D Bose gas measured across the Mott-insulator transition,"We realize a single-band 2D Bose-Hubbard system with Rb atoms in an optical lattice and measure the condensate fraction as a function of lattice depth, crossing from the superfluid to the Mott-insulating phase. We quantitatively identify the location of the superfluid to normal transition by observing when the condensed fraction vanishes. Our measurement agrees with recent quantum Monte Carlo calculations for a finite-sized 2D system to within experimental uncertainty.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,Local field of magnetic islands: role of their shape,"I analyze in details distribution of local magnetic field induced by micro- and nano-magnets. I consider three kinds of elongated magnetic islands: ellipse-, diamond- and rectangular shaped islands which were magnetized uniformly along long axis. This report concentrates on the role of their shape upon distribution of the field. Calculations show that unlike rectangular-shaped magnet, ellipse-shaped and diamond-shaped ones produce much more localized field in proximity of its magnetic poles. Additionally in the case of ellipse-shaped islands the magnitude of induced field is large. This two facts favor arrays of ellipse-shaped magnetic islands to build zero-dimensional spin traps in a hybrid based on Ferromagnet/Semiconductor structure.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,1
A Renormalizable Theory of Quantum Gravity: Renormalization Proof of the Gauge Theory of Volume Preserving Diffeomorphisms,Inertial and gravitational mass or energy-momentum need not be the same for virtual quantum states. Separating their roles naturally leads to the gauge theory of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of an inner four-dimensional space. The gauge-fixed action and the path integral measure occurring in the generating functional for the quantum Green functions of the theory are shown to obey a BRST-type symmetry. The related Zinn-Justin-type equation restricting the corresponding quantum effective action is established. This equation limits the infinite parts of the quantum effective action to have the same form as the gauge-fixed Lagrangian of the theory proving its spacetime renormalizability. The inner space integrals occurring in the quantum effective action which are divergent due to the gauge group's infinite volume are shown to be regularizable in a way consistent with the symmetries of the theory demonstrating as a byproduct that viable quantum gauge field theories are not limited to finite-dimensional compact gauge groups as is commonly assumed.,hep,hep-th,Implications of a frame dependent gravitational effective action for perturbations on the Robertson-Walker Metric,"In earlier work we showed that a frame dependent effective action motivated by the postulates of three-space general coordinate invariance and Weyl scaling invariance exactly mimics a cosmological constant in Robertson-Walker (RW) spacetimes. Here we study the implications of this effective action for small fluctuations around a spatially flat RW background geometry. The equations for the conserving extension of the modified stress-energy tensor can be integrated in closed form, and involve only the metric perturbation $h_{00}$. Hence the equations for tensor and vector perturbations are unmodified, but there are Hubble scale additions to the scalar perturbation equations, which nonetheless admit no propagating wave solutions. Consequently, there are no modifications to standard gravitational wave propagation theory, but there may be observable implications for cosmology. We give a self-contained discussion, including an analysis of the restricted class of gauge transformations that act when a frame dependent effective action is present.",hep,hep-th,1
Comparison of planetary H\alpha-emission models: A new correlation with accretion luminosity,"Accreting planets have been detected through their hydrogen-line emission, specifically H$\alpha$. To interpret this, stellar-regime empirical correlations between the H$\alpha$ luminosity $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ and the accretion luminosity $L_\mathrm{acc}$ or accretion rate $\dot{M}$ have been extrapolated to planetary masses, however without validation. We present a theoretical $L_\mathrm{acc}$--$L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ relationship applicable to a shock at the surface of a planet. We consider wide ranges of accretion rates and masses and use detailed spectrally-resolved, non-equilibrium models of the postshock cooling. The new relationship gives a markedly higher $L_\mathrm{acc}$ for a given $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ than fits to young stellar objects, because Ly-$\alpha$, which is not observable, carries a large fraction of $L_\mathrm{acc}$. Specifically, an $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ measurement needs ten to 100 times higher $L_\mathrm{acc}$ and $\dot{M}$ than previously predicted, which may explain the rarity of planetary H$\alpha$ detections. We also compare the $\dot{M}$--$L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ relationships coming from the planet-surface shock or implied by accretion-funnel emission. Both can contribute simultaneously to an observed H$\alpha$ signal but at low (high) $\dot{M}$ the planetary-surface shock (heated funnel) dominates. Only the shock produces Gaussian line wings. Finally, we discuss accretion contexts in which different emission scenarios may apply, putting recent literature models in perspective, and also present $L_\mathrm{acc}$--$L_\mathrm{line}$ relationships for several other hydrogen lines.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Massive compact disks around FU Orionis-type young eruptive stars revealed by ALMA,"FU Orionis-type objects (FUors) are low-mass pre-main sequence stars undergoing a temporary, but significant increase of mass accretion rate from the circumstellar disk onto the protostar. It is not yet clear what triggers the accretion bursts and whether the disks of FUors are in any way different from disks of non-bursting young stellar objects. Motivated by this, we conducted a 1.3 mm continuum survey of ten FUors and FUor-like objects with ALMA, using both the 7 m array and the 12 m array in two different configurations to recover emission at the widest possible range of spatial scales. We detected all targeted sources and several nearby objects as well. To constrain the disk structure, we fit the data with models of increasing complexity from 2D Gaussian to radiative transfer, enabling comparison with other samples modeled in a similar way. The radiative transfer modeling gives disk masses that are significantly larger than what is obtained from the measured millimeter fluxes assuming optically thin emission, suggesting that the FUor disks are optically thick at this wavelength. In comparison with samples of regular Class II and Class I objects, the disks of FUors are typically a factor of 2.9-4.4 more massive and a factor of 1.5-4.7 smaller in size. A significant fraction of them (65-70%) may be gravitationally unstable.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Electronic Transport Properties of Carbon NanoBuds,"Fullerene functionalized carbon nanotubes -- NanoBuds -- form a novel class of hybrid carbon materials, which possesses many advantageous properties as compared to the pristine components. Here, we report a theoretical study of the electronic transport properties of these compounds. We use both ab initio techniques and tight-binding calculations to illustrate these materials' transmission properties, and give physical arguments to interpret the numerical results. Specifically, above the Fermi energy we find a strong reduction of electron transmission due to localized states in certain regions of the structure while below the Fermi energy all considered structures exhibit a high-transmission energy band with a geometry dependent width.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Understanding Variations in Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence in Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides,"Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides are promising materials for valleytronic operations. They exhibit two inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin zone, and the valley populations can be directly controlled and determined using circularly polarized optical excitation and emission. The photoluminescence polarization reflects the ratio of the two valley populations. A wide range of values for the degree of circularly polarized emission, Pcirc, has been reported for monolayer WS2, although the reasons for the disparity are unclear. Here we optically populate one valley, and measure Pcirc to explore the valley population dynamics at room temperature in a large number of monolayer WS2 samples synthesized via chemical vapor deposition. Under resonant excitation, Pcirc ranges from 2% to 32%, and we observe a pronounced inverse relationship between photoluminescence (PL) intensity and Pcirc. High quality samples exhibiting strong PL and long exciton relaxation time exhibit a low degree of valley polarization, and vice versa. This behavior is also demonstrated in monolayer WSe2 samples and transferred WS2, indicating that this correlation may be more generally observed and account for the wide variations reported for Pcirc. Time resolved PL provides insight into the role of radiative and non-radiative contributions to the observed polarization. Short non-radiative lifetimes result in a higher measured polarization by limiting opportunity for depolarizing scattering events.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
"Influence de l'\'{e}lasticit\'{e} des lignes d'arbres, des roulements et du carter sur les vitesses critiques de rotation d'une transmission par engrenages","The dynamic behaviour of a gearbox fitted out with a helical gear pair is studied. Shafts, bearings and housing are discretised using the finite element method. The elastic coupling between the toothed wheels is characterised by a 12x12 stiffness matrix. The calculation of the vibration response induced by the static transmission error shows that the highest dynamic mesh forces correspond to a resonant excitation of modes which have a high mesh stiffness energy. The numerical simulations show that a realistic prediction of the critical rotational speeds should take account of all the components of the gearbox.",physics,physics.class-ph,Brittle fracture in a periodic structure with internal potential energy. Quasi-static analysis,"We consider a linearly elastic body consisting of two equal symmetrically arranged layers (or half-planes) connected by a structured interface as a prospective crack path. The interface is comprised by periodic discrete system of bonds. In the initial state with no external forces, the bonds are assumed to be stressed in such a way that tensile and compressive forces of the same value alternate. In the general considerations, the layers are assumed to be of a general, unspecified {\em periodic} structure, where such self-equilibrated residual stresses can also exist. A two-line chain and an anisotropic lattice are examined as illustrative examples. We consider the states of the body-with-a-crack under the residual stresses and under a combined action of the remote forces and residual stresses. Analytical solutions to the considered problems are presented. The solutions are based on a selective discrete transform introduced. In particular, it is found that a formula for local-to-global energy release ratio, written in terms of the Wiener-Hopf equation kernel, is very general. We show that the residual stresses can manifest themselves in a number of phenomena such as the crack bridging, `porous' in front of the crack and crack growth irregularities. We also demonstrate analytically and graphically that the residual stresses can result in increase as well as in decrease of the crack resistance depending on the internal energy level. The quasi-static considerations suggest different scenarios of the crack growth depending on the internal energy level.",physics,physics.class-ph,1
Electroweak Corrections,"The test of the electroweak corrections has played a major role in providing evidence for the gauge and the Higgs sectors of the Standard Model.

Dimensional reduction from five-dimensional gauge theories,"We study the phase diagram of five-dimensional SU(2) gauge theories on anisotropic lattices with periodic boundary conditions. We locate a line of first order bulk phase transitions and second order phase transitions related to breaking of the center along one direction. A reduction to four dimensions occurs through compactification of one dimension but not only. By choosing a lattice spacing in the extra dimension larger than in the other dimensions, we find hints that the hyperplanes orthogonal to the extra dimension decouple from each other. Our analysis is based on measurements of Polyakov loops, the static potential extracted from Wilson loops and renormalized couplings defined through the static force and its derivative.",hep,hep-th,First Order Actions for New Massive Dual Gravities,"We present a first order formulation for the fourth order action of the new massive dual gravity in four dimensions.

"Nanoscale structures formed in silicon cleavage studied with large-scale electronic structure alculations; surface reconstruction, step and bending","The 10-nm-scale structure in silicon cleavage is studied by the quantum mechanical calculations for large-scale electronic structure. The cleavage process on the order of 10 ps shows surface reconstruction and step formation. These processes are studied by analyzing electronic freedom and compared with STM experiments. The discussion presents the stability mechanism of the experimentally observed mode, the $(111)$-$(2 x 1)$ mode, beyond the traditional approach with surface energy. Moreover, in several results, the cleavage path is bent into the experimentally observed planes, owing to the relative stability among different cleavage modes. Finally, several common aspects between cleavage and other phenomena are discussed from the viewpoints of the nonequilibrium process and the 10-nm-scale structure.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,How to realize a negative refractive index material at the atomic level in an optical frequency range,"The theoretical mechanism for realizing the negative refractive index with {\it electromagnetically induced transparency} (EIT) is studied. It is shown that in a three-level dense atomic gas, there is a frequency band in which the EIT medium will exhibit simultaneously negative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in the optical frequency range, and the atomic gas thus becomes a left-handed material. The expressions for the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability for the probe frequency is presented. One of the remarkable features of the present novel scheme is such that the obtained EIT left-handed material is {\it isotropic} and may therefore have some potentially important applications in the development of new techniques in quantum optics.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
ALMA Observations of the Host Galaxy of GRB090423 at z=8.23: Deep Limits on Obscured Star Formation 630 Million Years After the Big Bang,"We present rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) and optical observations of the host galaxy of GRB090423 at z=8.23 from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the Spitzer Space Telescope, respectively. The host remains undetected to 3-sigma limits of Fnu(222 GHz)<33 microJy and Fnu(3.6 micron)<81 nJy. The FIR limit is about 20 times fainter than the luminosity of the local ULIRG Arp220, and comparable to the local starburst M82. Comparing to model spectral energy distributions we place a limit on the IR luminosity of L_IR(8-1000 micron)<3e10 Lsun, corresponding to a limit on the obscured star formation rate of SFR_IR<5 Msun/yr; for comparison, the limit on the unobscured star formation rate from Hubble Space Telescope rest-frame UV observations is SFR_UV<1 Msun/yr. We also place a limit on the host galaxy stellar mass of <5e7 Msun (for a stellar population age of 100 Myr and constant star formation rate). Finally, we compare our millimeter observations to those of field galaxies at z>4 (Lyman break galaxies, Ly-alpha emitters, and submillimeter galaxies), and find that our limit on the FIR luminosity is the most constraining to date, although the field galaxies have much larger rest-frame UV/optical luminosities than the host of GRB090423 by virtue of their selection techniques. We conclude that GRB host galaxies at z>4, especially those with measured interstellar medium metallicities from afterglow spectroscopy, are an attractive sample for future ALMA studies of high redshift obscured star formation.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Hot Stuff for One Year (HSOY) - A 583 million star proper motion catalogue derived from Gaia DR1 and PPMXL,"Recently, the first installment of data from ESA's Gaia astrometric satellite mission (Gaia-DR1) was released, containing positions of more than 1 billion stars with unprecedented precision, as well as only proper motions and parallaxes, however only for a subset of 2 million objects. The second release, due in late 2017 or early 2018, will include those quantities for most objects. In order to provide a dataset that bridges the time gap between the Gaia-DR1 and Gaia-DR2 releases and partly remedies the lack of proper motions in the former, HSOY (""Hot Stuff for One Year"") was created as a hybrid catalogue between Gaia-DR1 and ground-based astrometry, featuring proper motions (but no parallaxes) for a large fraction of the DR1 objects. While not attempting to compete with future Gaia releases in terms of data quality or number of objects, the aim of HSOY is to provide improved proper motions partly based on Gaia data, allowing some studies to be carried out just now or as pilot studies for later larger projects requiring higher-precision data. The HSOY catalogue was compiled using the positions taken from Gaia-DR1 combined with the input data from the PPMXL catalogue, employing the same weighted least-squares technique that was used to assemble the PPMXL catalogue itself. Results. This effort resulted in a four-parameter astrometric catalogue containing 583,000,000 objects, with Gaia-DR1 quality positions and proper motions with precisions from significantly less than 1 mas/yr to 5 mas/yr, depending on the object's brightness and location on the sky.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1

Probing Chiral Symmetry Restoration with Heavy Ions,It is discussed how chiral symmetry restoration manifests itself through mixing of vector and axial-vector correlators.

The results for $^{44}$Ti were surprisingly good despite the severity of this approximation. In this approximation degeneracies arose in the T=1/2 I=$({1/2})^-_1$ and $({13/2})^-_1$ states in $^{43}$Sc and the T=1/2 $I=({13/2})_2^-$, $({17/2})^-_1$, and $({19/2})_1^-$ in $^{43}$Sc. The T=0 $3_2^+$, $7_2^+$, $9_1^+$, and $10_1^+$ states in $^{44}$Ti were degenerate as well. The degeneracies can be explained by certain 6j symbols and 9j symbols either vanishing or being equal as indeed they are. Previously we used Regge symmetries of 6j symbols to explain these degeneracies. In this work a simpler more physical method is used. This is Talmi's method of calculating coefficients of fractional parentage for identical particles to states which are forbidden by the Pauli principle. This is done for both one particle cfp to handle 6j symbols and two particle cfp to handle 9j symbols. The states can be classified by the dual quantum numbers ($J_{\pi},J_{\nu}$).",nucl,nucl-th,1
Rotational Symmetry Protected Edge and Corner States in Abelian topological phases,"Spatial symmetries can enrich the topological classification of interacting quantum matter and endow systems with non-trivial strong topological invariants (protected by internal symmetries) with additional ""weak"" topological indices. In this paper, we study the edge physics of systems with a non-trivial shift invariant, which is protected by either a continuous $\text{U}(1)_r$ or discrete $\text{C}_n$ rotation symmetry, along with internal $\text{U}(1)_c$ charge conservation. Specifically, we construct an interface between two systems which have the same Chern number but are distinguished by their Wen-Zee shift and, through analytic arguments supported by numerics, show that the interface hosts counter-propagating gapless edge modes which cannot be gapped by arbitrary local symmetry-preserving perturbations. Using the Chern-Simons field theory description of two-dimensional Abelian topological orders, we then prove sufficient conditions for continuous rotation symmetry protected gapless edge states using two complementary approaches. One relies on the algebraic Lagrangian sub-algebra framework for gapped boundaries while the other uses a more physical flux insertion argument. For the case of discrete rotation symmetries, we extend the field theory approach to show the presence of fractional corner charges for Abelian topological orders with gappable edges, and compute them in the case where the Abelian topological order is placed on the two-dimensional surface of a Platonic solid. Our work paves the way for studying the edge physics associated with spatial symmetries in symmetry enriched topological phases.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Interlayer Pairing Symmetry of Composite Fermions in Quantum Hall Bilayers,"We study the pairing symmetry of the interlayer paired state of composite fermions in quantum Hall bilayers. Based on the Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) theory, the effect of the long-range Coulomb interaction and the internal Chern-Simons gauge fluctuation is analyzed with the random-phase approximation beyond the leading order contribution in small momentum expansion, and we observe that the interlayer paired states with a relative angular momentum $l=+1$ are energetically favored for filling $\nu=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}$. The degeneracy between states with $\pm l$ is lifted by the interlayer density-current interaction arising from the interplay of the long-range Coulomb interaction and the Chern-Simons term in the HLR theory.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Maximum Spin of Black Holes Driving Jets,"Unbounded outflows in the form of highly collimated jets and broad winds appear to be a ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems. The most powerful jets are thought to derive a significant fraction, if not the majority, of their power from the rotational energy of the black hole. Whatever the precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must therefore exert a braking torque on the black hole. We calculate the spin-up function for an accreting black hole, accounting for this braking torque. We find that the predicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole spin and dimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using recent relativistic magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulation results to calibrate the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the flow, we find that an ADAF flow will spin a black hole up (or down) to an equilibrium value of about 96% of the maximal spin value in the absence of jets. Combining our ADAF system with a simple model for jet power, we demonstrate that an equilibrium is reached at approximately 93% of the maximal spin value, as found in the numerical simulation studies of the spin-up of accreting black holes, at which point the spin-up of the hole by accreted material is balanced by the braking torque arising from jet production. Our model also yields a relationship between jet efficiency and black hole spin that is in surprisingly good agreement with that seen in the simulation studies, indicating that our simple model is a useful and convenient description of ADAF inflow - jet outflow about a spinning black hole for incorporation in models of the formation and evolution of galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Kinematics of MgII Absorbers from the Redshift-space Distortion Around Massive Quiescent Galaxies,"The kinematics of MgII absorbers is the key to understanding the origin of cool, metal-enriched gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium of massive quiescent galaxies. Exploiting the fact that the cloud line-of-sight velocity distribution is the only unknown for predicting the redshift-space distortion~(RSD) of MgII absorbers from their 3D real-space distribution around galaxies, we develop a novel method to infer the cool cloud kinematics from the redshift-space galaxy-cloud cross-correlation $\xi^{s}$. We measure $\xi^{s}$ for ${\sim}10^4$ MgII absorbers around ${\sim}8{\times}10^5$ CMASS galaxies at $0.4{<}z{<}0.8$. We discover that $\xi^{s}$ does not exhibit a strong Fingers-of-God effect, but is heavily truncated at velocity ${\sim}300\,km/s$. We reconstruct both the redshift and real-space cloud number density distributions inside haloes, $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ and $\xi_{1h}$, respectively. Thus, for any model of cloud kinematics, we can predict $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ from the reconstructed $\xi_{1h}$, and self-consistently compare to the observed $\xi^{s}_{1h}$. We consider four types of cloud kinematics, including an isothermal model with a single velocity dispersion, a satellite infall model in which cool clouds reside in the subhaloes, a cloud accretion model in which clouds follow the cosmic gas accretion, and a tired wind model in which clouds originate from the galactic wind-driven bubbles. All the four models provide statistically good fits to the RSD data, but only the tired wind model can reproduce the observed truncation by propagating ancient wind bubbles at ${\sim}250\,km/s$ on scales ${\sim}400\,kpc/h$. Our method provides an exciting path to decoding the dynamical origin of metal absorbers from the RSD measurements with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1

We calculate the decay widths of the observed channels X-> Jpsi+2\pi (3\pi) and X-> \bar D0+D0+\pi0 via the intermediate off--shell states X-> Jpsi+\rho(\omega) and X-> \bar D + D*. For reasonable values of the size parameter of the X(3872) we find consistency with the available experimental data.

Model-independent Constraint on the Neutrino Mass Spectrum from the Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay,"We present a concise formula to relate the effective mass term of the neutrinoless double beta decay to a single neutrino mass, two Majorana CP-violating phases and four observables of neutrino oscillations for a generic neutrino mass spectrum. If the alleged evidence for the neutrinoless double beta decay is taken into account, one may obtain a rough but model-independent constraint on the absolute scale of neutrino masses -- it is most likely to be in the range between 0.1 eV and 1 eV.",hep,hep-ph,Compositeness of near-threshold exotic hadrons with decay and coupled-channel effects,"The near-threshold exotic hadrons such as $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$ are naively considered as the hadronic molecular state from the viewpoint of the low-energy universality. However, it is also known that the elementary dominant state is not completely excluded as the internal structure of the near-threshold states. Furthermore, the dominance of molecules is expected to be modified by the decay or coupled channels. We discuss these features of the near-threshold bound states by calculating the compositeness with the effective field theory.",hep,hep-ph,1
Fully heavy pentaquarks,"Very recently, the LHCb Collaboration reported a fully charmed tetraquark state $X(6900)$ in the invariant mass spectrum of $J/\psi$ pairs.

In this work, we perform a systematic study on the mass spectra of the S-wave fully heavy pentaquark $QQQQ\bar{Q}$ in the framework of the chromomagnetic interaction model. Based on our results in two different schemes, we further investigate the decay behaviors for them. We hope that our study will be helpful in searching for such types of exotic pentaquark states in experiments in the future.",hep,hep-ex,Observation of B+ -> proton Lambdabar gamma,"We report the first observation of the radiative hyperonic B decay B+ -> proton Lambdabar gamma, using a 140 fb-1 data sample recorded on the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+e- collider.

A search for B+ -> proton Sigmabar gamma yields no significant signal, so we set a 90% confidence-level upper limit on the branching fraction of B(B+ -> proton Sigmabar gamma) < 3.3 times 10^{-6}.",hep,hep-ex,1
Physics Informed Deep Learning for Flow and Transport in Porous Media,"We present our progress on the application of physics informed deep learning to reservoir simulation problems. The model is a neural network that is jointly trained to respect governing physical laws and match boundary conditions. The methodology is hereby used to simulate a 2-phase immiscible transport problem (Buckley-Leverett). The model is able to produce an accurate physical solution both in terms of shock and rarefaction and honors the governing partial differential equation along with initial and boundary conditions. We test various hypothesis (uniform and non-uniform initial conditions) and show that with the proper implementation of physical constraints, a robust solution can be trained within a reasonable amount of time and iterations. We revisit some of the limitations presented in previous work \cite{Fuks2020} and further the applicability of this method in a forward, pure hyperbolic setup. We also share some practical findings on the application of physics informed neural networks (PINN). We review various network architectures presented in the literature and show tips that helped improve their convergence and accuracy. The proposed methodology is a simple and elegant way to instill physical knowledge to machine-learning algorithms. This alleviates the two most significant shortcomings of machine-learning algorithms: the requirement for large datasets and the reliability of extrapolation. The principles presented can be generalized in innumerable ways in the future and should lead to a new class of algorithms to solve both forward and inverse physical problems.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,Liquid marbles as thermally robust droplets: coating-assisted Leidenfrost-like effect,"The Leidenfrost effect-prolonged evaporation of droplets on a superheated surface-happens only when the surface temperature is above a certain transitional value. Here, we show that specially engineered droplets - liquid marbles - can exhibit similar effect at any superheated temperatures (up to 465 oC tested in our experiment) without a transition. Very possibly, this phenomenon is due to the fact that liquid marbles are droplets coated with microparticles and these microparticles help levitate the liquid core and maintain an insulation layer between the liquid and the superheated surface.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,1
Dynamics of supertubes,"We find the evolution of arbitrary excitations on 2-charge supertubes, by mapping the supertube to a string carrying traveling waves. We argue that when the coupling is increased from zero the energy of excitation leaks off to infinity, and when the coupling is increased still further a new set of long lived excitations emerge. We relate the excitations at small and large couplings to excitations in two different phases in the dual CFT. We conjecture a way to distinguish bound states from unbound states among 3-charge BPS geometries; this would identify black hole microstates among the complete set of BPS geometries.",hep,hep-th,Note on Thermodynamics Method of Black Hole/CFT Correspondence,"In the paper we further refine the thermodynamics method of black hole/CFT correspondence. We show that one can derive the central charges of different holographic pictures directly from the entropy product $S_+S_-$ if it is mass-independent, for a black hole in the Einstein gravity or the gravity without diffeomorphism anomaly. For a general black hole in the Einstein gravity that admits holographic descriptions, we show that the thermodynamics method and asymptotic symmetry group (ASG) analysis can always give consistent results in the extreme limit. Furthermore, we discuss the relation between black hole thermodynamics and the hidden conformal symmetry. We show that the condition $T_+A_+=T_-A_-$, with $A_\pm$ being the outer and inner horizon areas, is the necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a black hole to have the hidden conformal symmetry. In particular, for the Einstein(-Maxwell) gravity $T_+A_+=T_-A_-$ is just the condition $T_+S_+=T_-S_-$, with $S_\pm$ being the outer and inner horizon entropies, which is the condition for the entropy product $S_+S_-$ being mass-dependent. When there exists the hidden conformal symmetry in the low-frequency scattering off the generic non-extremal black hole, it always leads to the same temperatures of dual CFT as the ones got from the thermodynamics method.",hep,hep-th,1
Long-Lived Vortex Structures in Collisional Pure and Gas-Discharge Nonneutral Electron Plasmas,"The analysis of experimental investigations of equilibrium, interaction and dynamics of vortex structures in pure electron and gas-discharge electron nonneutral plasmas during the time much more than the electron-neutral collision time has been carried out. The problem of long confinement of the column of pure electron plasma in Penning-Malmberg trap is considered. The mechanism of stability of long-lived vortex structure in gas-discharge nonneutral electron plasma is investigated. The collapse of electron sheath in gas-discharge nonneutral electron plasma in Penning cell at high pressures of neutral gas is described. The interaction between the stable vortex structure and the annular electron sheath, and the action of vortex structures on the transport of electrons along and across the magnetic field are discussed.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,Anomalies in Universal Intensity Scaling in Ultrarelativistic Laser-Plasma Interactions,"Laser light incident on targets at intensities such that the electron dynamics is ultrarelativistic gives rise to a harmonic power spectrum extending to high orders and characterized by a relatively slow decay with the harmonic number m that follows a power law dependence, m^{-p}. Relativistic similarity theory predicts a universal value for p = 8/3 up to some cut-off m = m*. The results presented in this work suggest that under conditions in which plasma effects contribute to the emission spectrum, the extent of this contribution may invalidate the concept of universal decay. We report a decay with harmonic number in the ultrarelativistic range characterised by an index 5/3 < p < 7/3, significantly weaker than that predicted by the similarity model.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,1
The Noncommutative S-Matrix,"As a simple example of how recently developed on-shell techniques apply to nonlocal theories, we study the S-matrix of noncommutative gauge theories. In the complex plane, this S-matrix has essential singularities that signal the nonlocal behavior of the theory. In spite of this, we show that tree-level amplitudes may be obtained by BCFW type recursion relations. At one loop we find a complete basis of master integrals (this basis is larger than the corresponding basis in the ordinary theory). Any one-loop noncommutative amplitude may be written as a linear combination of these integrals with coefficients that we relate to products of tree amplitudes. We show that the noncommutative N=4 SYM theory has a structurally simple S-matrix, just like the ordinary N=4 SYM theory.",hep,hep-ph,The Muon g-2,"The muon anomalous magnetic moment is one of the most precisely measured quantities in particle physics. In a recent experiment at Brookhaven it has been measured with a remarkable 14-fold improvement of the previous CERN experiment reaching a precision of 0.54ppm. Since the first results were published, a persisting ""discrepancy"" between theory and experiment of about 3 standard deviations is observed. It is the largest ""established"" deviation from the Standard Model seen in a ""clean"" electroweak observable and thus could be a hint for New Physics to be around the corner. This deviation triggered numerous speculations about the possible origin of the ""missing piece"" and the increased experimental precision animated a multitude of new theoretical efforts which lead to a substantial improvement of the prediction of the muon anomaly a_mu=(g_mu-2)/2. The dominating uncertainty of the prediction, caused by strong interaction effects, could be reduced substantially, due to new hadronic cross section measurements in electron-positron annihilation at low energies. Also the recent electron g-2 measurement at Harvard contributes substantially to the progress in this field, as it allows for a much more precise determination of the fine structure constant alpha as well as a cross check of the status of our theoretical understanding.",hep,hep-ph,1
Imaging and spectroscopy of artificial-atom states in core/shell nanocrystal quantum dots,"Current imaging scanning tunneling microscopy is used to observe the electronic wavefunctions in InAs/ZnSe core/shell nanocrystals. Images taken at a bias corresponding to the s conduction band state show that it is localized in the central core region, while images at higher bias probing the p state reveal that it extends to the shell. This is supported by optical and tunneling spectroscopy data demonstrating that the s-p gap closes upon shell growth. Shapes of the current images resemble atom-like envelope wavefunctions of the quantum dot calculated within a particle in a box model.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Relative efficiency of polariton emission in two-dimensional materials,"We investigated emission and propagation of polaritons in a two dimensional van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Our specific emphasis in this work is on hyperbolic phonon polariton emission that we investigated by means of scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy. Real-space nano-images detail how the polaritons are launched in several common arrangements including: light scattering by the edges of the crystal, metallic nanostructures deposited on the surface of hBN crystals, as well as random defects and impurities. Notably, the scanned tip of the near-field microscope is itself an efficient polariton launcher. Our analysis reveals that the scanning tips are superior to other types of emitters we have investigated. Furthermore, the study of polariton emission and emission efficiency may provide insights for development of polaritonic devices and for fundamental studies of collective modes in other van der Waals materials.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Statistical Analysis for Long Term Correlations in the Stress Time Series of Jerky Flow,"Stress time series from the PLC effect typically exhibit stick-slips of upload and download type. These data contain strong short-term correlations of a nonlinear type. We investigate whether there are also long term correlations, i.e. the successive up-down patterns are generated by a deterministic mechanism. A statistical test is conducted for the null hypothesis that the sequence of the up-down patterns is totally random. The test is constructed by means of surrogate data, suitably generated to represent the null hypothesis. Linear and nonlinear estimates are used as test statistics, namely autocorrelation, mutual information and Lyapunov exponents, which are found to have proper performance for the test. The test is then applied to three stress time series under different experimental conditions. Rejections are obtained for one of them and not with all statistics. From the overall results we cannot conclude that the underlying mechanism to the PLC effect has long memory.",physics,physics.data-an,Classification of interest rate curves using Self-Organising Maps,"The present study deals with the analysis and classification of interest rate curves. Interest rate curves (IRC) are the basic financial curves in many different fields of economics and finance. They are extremely important tools in banking and financial risk management problems. Interest rates depend on time and maturity which defines term structure of the interest rate curves. IRC are composed of interest rates at different maturities (usually fixed number) which move coherently in time. In the present study machine learning algorithms, namely Self-Organising maps - SOM (Kohonen maps), are used to find clusters and to classify Swiss franc (CHF) interest rate curves.",physics,physics.data-an,1
Cosmography in $f(Q)$ gravity,"Cosmography is an ideal tool to investigate the cosmic expansion history of the Universe in a model-independent way. The equations of motion in modified theories of gravity are usually very complicated; cosmography may select practical models without imposing arbitrary choices a priori. We use the model-independent way to derive $f(z)$ and its derivatives up to fourth order in terms of measurable cosmographic parameters. We then fit those functions into the luminosity distance directly. We perform the MCMC analysis by considering three different sets of cosmographic functions. Using the largest supernovae Ia Pantheon sample, we derive the constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the cosmographic functions, and find that the former two terms in Taylor expansion of luminosity distance work dominantly in $f(Q)$ gravity.",hep,hep-th,The gravity duals of SO/USp superconformal quivers,"We study the gravity duals of SO/USp superconformal quiver gauge theories realized by M5-branes wrapping on a Riemann surface (""G-curve"") together with a Z_2-quotient. When the G-curve has no punctures, the gravity solutions are classified by the genus g of the G-curve and the torsion part of the four-form flux G_4. We also find that there is an interesting relation between anomaly contributions from two mysterious theories: T_{SO(2N)} theory with SO(2N)^3 flavor symmetry and \tilde{T}_{SO(2N)} theory with SO(2N) x USp(2N-2)^2 flavor symmetry. The dual gravity solutions for various SO/USp-type tails are also studied.",hep,hep-th,1
The CP violating phase $\gamma$ from global fit of rare charmless hadronic B decays,"We study constraints on the CP violating phase $\gamma$ in the Kobayashi-Maskawa model using available experimental data. We first follow the conventional method to up date the constraint on $\gamma$ by performing a $\chi^2$ analysis using data from $|\epsilon_K|$, $\Delta m_{B_{d,s}}$ and $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$. We also include the recent information on $\sin2\beta$ in the analysis. We obtain the best fit for $\gamma$ to be $66^\circ$ and the 95% C.L. allowed range to be $42^\circ \sim 87^\circ$. We then develop a method to carry out a $\chi^2$ analysis based on SU(3) symmetry using data from $B\to \pi \pi$ and $B\to K \pi$. We also discuss SU(3) breaking effects from model estimate. We find that present data on $B\to \pi\pi, K \pi$ can also give some constraint on $\gamma$ although weaker than the earlier method limited by the present experimental errors. Future improved data will provide more stringent constraint. Finally we perform a combined fit using data from $|\epsilon_K|$, $\Delta m_{B_{d,s}}$, $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$, $\sin2\beta$ and rare charmless hadronic B decays. The combined analysis gives $\gamma=67^\circ$ for the best fit value and $43^\circ \sim 87^\circ$ as the 95% C.L. allowed range. Several comments on other methods to determine $\gamma$ based on SU(3) symmetry are also provided.",hep,hep-ex,Faster Parton Distribution Evaluation in Monte Carlos,"I recommend a few trivial changes to the routines that evaluate CTEQ parton distribution functions. These changes allow modern compilers to optimize the evaluation routines, while having no quantitative effect on the results. Computation time is reduced by a factor of 2 in matrix-element calculations, and by 1.3-1.5 in the showering Monte Carlo event generators with fast detector effects included. The results suggest that additional time should be invested in optimizing these routines.",hep,hep-ex,1
"Beyond boundaries of redshift surveys: assessing mass fluctuations on ""super-survey"" scales","The observed density field in redshift space is directly affected by the radial motions generated from mass fluctuations outside the volume occupied by a given galaxy redshift survey. These motions introduce redshift space anisotropies which are more pronounced at larger distances from the survey's center, thus offering clues to the nature of mass fluctuations on super-survey scales. Furthermore, we note that all estimates of the growth factor derived from redshift space distortions are based on relations which explicitly assume that the velocity field is generated by mass fluctuations inside the survey volume. This may cause uncertainties in these estimates which are on the order of a few percent.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Generation of Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves from Dilaton-Gauge Field Dynamics,"We study the observational signatures from particle production of a $U(1)$ gauge field kinetically coupled to an inflaton. Regarding the form of gauge kinetic function, we consider the possibility that it becomes stabilized at a certain time, which makes the growing power of the gauge field evolve non-monotonically with a sharp transition. Remarkably, the copious production of the gauge field occurs on super-horizon scales at the late stage of inflation and perturbations are enhanced on the intermediate scales during inflation. We find that it can predict a bumpy shape of the curvature power spectrum which leads to the generation of primordial black holes as a dark matter after inflation. We also estimate two types of tensor modes sourced by the gauge field: the primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation and the induced gravitational waves provided by the enhanced curvature perturbation after inflation. We show that both of them are potentially testable with the future space-based gravitational wave interferometers.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Comparison of Chiral Perturbation Theory and QCD Sum Rule Results for Pseudoscalar Isoscalar-Isovector Mixing,"The forms of the neutral, non-strange pseudoscalar propagator matrix and mixed axial current correlator, $\lngle0|T(A_\mu^3 A_\nu^8)|0\rangle$, are discussed at next-to-leading (one-loop) order in chiral perturbation theory, and the results compared to those obtained using QCD sum rules. This comparison provides a check of the truncations employed in the sum rule treatment of the current correlator. Values for the slope of the correlator with $q^2$ in the two approaches are found to differ by more than an order of magnitude and the source of this discrepancy is shown to be the incorrect chiral behavior of the sum rule result.",nucl,nucl-th,The study of fusion barriers of neutron-rich colliding nuclei using various isospin-dependent potentials,"A detailed study fusion of neutron-rich colliding nuclei is performed using various isospin dependent potentials.

Curvature relations in almost product manifolds,New relations involving curvature components for the various connections appearing in the theory of almost product manifolds are given and the conformal behaviour of these connections are studied. New identities for the irreducible parts of the deformation tensor are derived. Some direct physical applications in Kaluza-Klein and gauge theory are discussed.,hep,hep-th,Origin of the tail in Green's functions in odd dimensional space-times,"It is well known that the scalar field Green's function in odd dimensions has a tail, i.e. a non-zero support inside the light cone, which in turn implies that the Huygens' principle is violated. However, the reason behind this behavior is still not quite clear. In this paper we shed more light on the physical origin of the tail by regularizing the term which is usually ignored in the literature since it vanishes due to the action of the delta function. With this extra term the Green's function does not satisfy the source-free wave equation (in the region outside of the source). We show that this term corresponds to a charge imprinted on the light cone shell. Unlike the vector field charge, a moving scalar field charge is not Lorentz invariant and is contracted by the relativistic $\sqrt{1-v^2}$ factor. If a scalar charge is moving at the speed of light, it appears to be zero in the static (with respect to the original physical charge) observer's frame. However, the field it sources is not entirely on the light cone. Thus, it is likely that this hidden charge sources the mysterious tail in odd dimensions.",hep,hep-th,1
Fourth-order QCD renormalization group quantities in the {\rm{V}}-scheme and the relation of the $\beta$-function to the Gell-Mann--Low function in QED,"The semi-analytical $O(\alpha_s^4)$ expression for the renormalization group $\beta$-function in the ${\rm{V}}$-scheme is obtained in the case of the $SU(N_c)$ gauge group. In the process of calculations we use the existing information about the three-loop perturbative approximation for the QCD static potential, evaluated in the $\rm{\overline{MS}}$-scheme. The comparison of the numerical values of the third and fourth coefficients for the QCD RG $\beta$- functions in the gauge-independent ${\rm{V}}$- and $\rm{\overline{MS}}$-schemes and in minimal MOM scheme in the the Landau gauge is presented. The phenomenologically-oriented comparisons for the coefficients of $O(\alpha_s^4)$ expression for the $e^+e^-$-annihilation R-ratio in these schemes are presented. It is shown, that taking into account of these QCD contributions are of vital importance and lead to the drastic decrease of the scheme-dependence ambiguities of the fourth-order perturbative QCD approximations for the $e^+e^-$ annihilation R-ratio for the number of active flavours,$n_f=5$ in particular. We demonstrate that in the case of QED with $N$-types of leptons the coefficients of the $\beta^{\rm{V}}$-function are closely related to the ones of the Gell-Mann--Low $\Psi$-function and emphasise that they start to differ from each other at the fourth order due to the appearance of the extra $N^2$-contribution in the V-scheme. The source of this extra correction is clarified. The general all-order QED relations between the coefficients of the $\beta^{\rm{V}}$- and $\Psi$-functions are discussed.",hep,hep-th,Gravitational waves of a first-order QCD phase transition at finite coupling from holography,"We consider a holographic study of coupling dependent gravitational waves produced by the cosmic first order QCD phase transition at finite baryochemical potential. In the dual description, the first-order QCD phase transition corresponds to the first-order Hawking-Page phase transition in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. At intermediate coupling, we obtain key quantities characterizing the gravitational wave energy density spectrum. We then find that the gravitational waves might be detected for sufficiently large Gauss-Bonnet coupling, while sound waves play an important role in the spectrum. We also consider a supercooling scenario during the QCD phase transition and show that the gravitational waves generated during this period can be detected by pulsar timing array experiments.",hep,hep-th,1
Scalar Absorption and the Breaking of the World Volume Conformal Invariance,We investigate a version of fixed scalars for non-dilatonic branes which correspond to dilatations of the brane world-volume. We obtain a cross-section whose world-volume interpretation falls out naturally from an investigation of the breaking of conformal invariance by the irrelevant Born-Infeld corrections to Yang-Mills theory. From the same irrelevant world-volume operator we obtain the leading correction to the cross-sections of minimal scalars. This correction can be obtained in supergravity via an improved matching of inner and outer solutions to the minimal wave equation.,hep,hep-th,Azimuthally-correlated contributions to QCD transverse-momentum resummation at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\rm S}^2)$,"Singular factors originating from the QCD factorisation of scattering amplitudes in soft and collinear limits play a prominent role in both organising and computing high-order perturbative contributions to hard-scattering cross sections. In this talk, we start from the factorisation structure of scattering amplitudes in the collinear limit, and we introduce collinear functions that have a process-independent structure. These collinear functions, which are defined at the fully-differential level, can then be integrated over the appropriate observable-dependent phase space to compute logarithmically-enhanced contributions to the corresponding observable. For transverse-momentum dependent observables, we show how the collinear functions can be defined without introducing what is known as rapidity divergences in the literature. We present the results of explicit computations of the collinear functions up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the QCD perturbation theory.",hep,hep-th,1
Non-oscillating Early Dark Energy and Quintessence from Alpha-Attractors,"Early dark energy (EDE) is one of the most promising possibilities in order to resolve the Hubble tension: the discrepancy between early and late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant. In this paper we propose a model of a scalar field which can explain both EDE and late Dark Energy (DE) in a joined manner without additional fine-tuning. The field features kinetic poles as with alpha-attractors. Our model provides an injection of EDE near matter-radiation equality, and redshifts away shortly after via free-fall, later refreezing to become late-time DE at the present day. Using reasonable estimates of the current constraints on EDE from the literature, we find that the parameter space is narrow but viable. As such our model is readily falsifiable. In contrast to other work in EDE, our model is non-oscillatory, which causes its decay to be faster than that of the usual oscillatory EDE, thereby achieving better agreement with observations.",hep,hep-th,Spectrum of Massive and Massless Ambitwistor Strings,"Inspired by recent work arXiv:2301.11227 on massive ambitwistor strings this paper examines the spectrum of such models using oscillator expansions. The spectrum depends heavily on the constant related to the normal ordering of the zero mode operator ${L_0}$ of the Virasoro algebra. The supergravity model is investigated in more detail, and two anomaly-free variations are presented, both with a rich spectrum and with tree scattering amplitudes that include a kinematic Parke-Taylor factor for particles other than gravitons without a need for an external current algebra. The spectrum of some of the models can also be interpreted as containing three generations of the Pati-Salam model.",hep,hep-th,1
Luminosity of young Jupiters revisited. Massive cores make hot planets,"The intrinsic luminosity of young Jupiters is of high interest for planet formation theory. It is an observable quantity that is determined by important physical mechanisms during formation, namely the accretion shock structure, and even more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or gravitational instability). We study the impact of the core mass on the post-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core accretion with a supercritical shock (cold accretion). For this, we conduct self-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets with masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120 Earth masses. We find that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant planets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase of the core mass by a factor 6 results in an increase of the post-formation luminosity of a 10 Jovian mass planet by a factor 120. Due to this dependency, there is no single well defined post-formation luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range. For massive cores (~100 Earth masses), the post-formation luminosities of core accretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start scenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the mechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or during gas runaway accretion, and that they sink deep into the planet. We make no claims whether or not such massive cores can actually form in giant planets. But if yes, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as formation mechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more luminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational instability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity could also be caused simply by a more massive core.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,Hidden Worlds: Dynamical Architecture Predictions of Undetected Planets in Multi-planet Systems and Applications to TESS Systems,"Multi-planet systems produce a wealth of information for exoplanet science, but our understanding of planetary architectures is incomplete. Probing these systems further will provide insight into orbital architectures and formation pathways. Here we present a model to predict previously undetected planets in these systems via population statistics. The model considers both transiting and non-transiting planets, and can test the addition of more than one planet. Our tests show the model's orbital period predictions are robust to perturbations in system architectures on the order of a few percent, much larger than current uncertainties. Applying it to the multi-planet systems from TESS provides a prioritized list of targets, based on predicted transit depth and probability, for archival searches and for guiding ground-based follow-up observations hunting for hidden planets.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,1
Characterizing solute hydrogen and hydrides in pure and alloyed titanium at the atomic scale,"Ti has a high affinity for hydrogen and is a typical hydride formers. Ti-hydride are brittle phases which probably cause premature failure of Ti-alloys. Here, we used atom probe tomography and electron microscopy to investigate the hydrogen distribution in a set of specimens of commercially pure Ti, model and commercial Ti-alloys. Although likely partly introduced during specimen preparation with the focused-ion beam, we show formation of Ti-hydrides along {\alpha} grain boundaries and {\alpha}/\b{eta} phase boundaries in commercial pure Ti and {\alpha}+\b{eta} binary model alloys. No hydrides are observed in the {\alpha} phase in alloys with Al addition or quenched-in Mo supersaturation.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Prediction of Macrobending and Splice Losses for Photonic Crystal Fibers based on the Effective Index Method,"An index-guiding photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with an array of air holes surrounding the silica core region has special characteristics compared to conventional single-mode fibers (SMFs). Using the effective index method and the Gaussian beam propagation theory, the macro-bending and splice losses for PCFs are investigated. The wavelength dependence of the cladding index of the PCF has been taken properly into account. We obtain the effective spot size for different configurations of PCFs, which is used for computing the splice losses. The Gaussian approximation for the fundamental modal field leads to simple closed-form expressions for the splice losses produced by transverse, longitudinal and angular offsets. Calculations of macro-bending losses are based on antenna theory for bend standard fibers.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Mending $\rho\pi\pi$ vertex through the $\pi a_1$ diagonalization,"The problem of the strong momentum dependence of the $\rho\pi\pi$-vertex in the extended Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio model is solved by an appropriate choice of fields for spin-1 particles. A corresponding phenomenological Lagrangian is derived. As straightforward applications, the decay widths of $\rho\to\pi\pi$, and $a_1\to\rho\pi$ transitions are calculated and compared with known empirical data and previous theoretical estimates.",hep,hep-ph,Spin Structure of the Nucleon - Status and Recent Results,"After the initial discovery of the so-called ""spin crisis in the parton model"" in the 1980's, a large set of polarization data in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering was collected at labs like SLAC, DESY and CERN. More recently, new high precision data at large x and in the resonance region have come from experiments at Jefferson Lab. These data, in combination with the earlier ones, allow us to study in detail the polarized parton densities, the Q^2 dependence of various moments of spin structure functions, the duality between deep inelastic and resonance data, and the nucleon structure in the valence quark region. Together with complementary data from HERMES, RHIC and COMPASS, we can put new limits on the flavor decomposition and the gluon contribution to the nucleon spin. In this report, we provide an overview of our present knowledge of the nucleon spin structure and give an outlook on future experiments. We focus in particular on the spin structure functions g_1 and g_2 of the nucleon and their moments.",hep,hep-ph,1
Double-winding Wilson loops and monopole confinement mechanisms,"We consider ""double-winding"" Wilson loops in SU(2) gauge theory. These are contours which wind once around a loop $C_1$ and once around a loop $C_2$, where the two co-planar loops share one point in common, and where $C_1$ lies entirely in (or is displaced slightly from) the minimal area of $C_2$. We discuss the expectation value of such double-winding loops in abelian confinement pictures, where the spatial distribution of confining abelian fields is controlled by either a monopole Coulomb gas, a caloron ensemble, or a dual abelian Higgs model, and argue that in such models an exponential falloff in the sum of areas $A_1+A_2$ is expected. In contrast, in a center vortex model of confinement, the behavior is an exponential falloff in the difference of areas $A_2-A_1$. We compute such double-winding loops by lattice Monte Carlo simulation, and find that the area law falloff follows a difference-in-areas law. The conclusion is that even if confining gluonic field fluctuations are, in some gauge, mainly abelian in character, the spatial distribution of those abelian fields cannot be the distribution predicted by the simple monopole gas, caloron ensemble, or dual abelian Higgs actions, which have been used in the past to explain the area law falloff of Wilson loops.",hep,hep-lat,Quadrupole pressure and shear forces inside baryons in the large $N_c$ limit,"We derive number of relations between quadrupole energy, elastic pressure, and shear force distributions in baryons using the large $N_c$ picture of baryons as chiral solitons. The obtained large $N_c$ relations are independent of particular dynamics and should hold in any picture in which the baryon is the chiral soliton. One of remarkable qualitative predictions of the soliton picture is the nullification of the tangential forces acting on the radial area element for any tensor polarisation of the baryon. The derived relations provide a powerful tool to check the hypothesis that the baryons are chiral solitons, say using lattice QCD.",hep,hep-lat,1
Cosmological and Astrophysical Implications of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect,"The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect provides a useful probe of cosmology and structure formation in the Universe. Recent years have seen rapid progress in both quality and quantity of its measurements. In this review, we overview cosmological and astrophysical implications of recent and near future observations of the effect. They include measuring the evolution of the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature, the distance-redshift relation out to high redshifts, number counts and power spectra of galaxy clusters, distributions and dynamics of intracluster plasma, and large-scale motions of the Universe.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,E and B families of the Stokes parameters in the polarized synchrotron and thermal dust foregrounds,"Better understanding of Galactic foregrounds is one of the main obstacles to detection of primordial gravitational waves through measurement of the B mode in the polarized microwave sky. We generalize the method proposed in \cite{2011PhRvD..83h3003B} and decompose the polarization signals into the E and B families directly in the domain of the Stokes $Q$, $U$ parameters as $(Q,U)\equiv(Q_E, U_E)+(Q_B,U_B)$. This also enables an investigation of the morphology and the frequency dependence of these two families, which has been done in the WMAP K, Ka (tracing synchrotron emission) and Planck 2015 HFI maps (tracing thermal dust). The results reveal significant differences in spectra between the E and B families. The spectral index of the E family fluctuates less across the sky than that of the B family, and the same tendency occurs for the polarization angles of the dust and synchrotron channels. The new insight from WMAP and Planck data on the North Polar Spur and BICEP2 zones through our method clearly indicates that these zones are characterized by very low polarization intensity of the B family compared to the E family. We have detected global structure of the B family polarization angles at high Galactic latitudes which cannot be attributed to the cosmic microwave background or instrumental noise. However, we cannot exclude instrumental systematics as a partial contributor to these anomalies.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Proton helicity structure function g_1^p from a holographic Pomeron,"We present a detailed analysis of the polarized and the unpolarized deep inelastic scattering structure functions of the proton, g_1^p and F_2^p respectively, in the context of a holographic dual description based on type IIB superstring theory. We compare this description with experimental data and Quantum Chromodynamics estimates computed at leading, next-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbation. We confront the predictions of a holographic dual model and those of perturbative QCD for g_1^p at the kinematics that will be probed by the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider. We find that the extrapolation of g_1^p to very small values the Bjorken variable computed with a Holographic Pomeron model based on actual data at higher momentum fractions is always positive and differs significantly with standard projections based on perturbative QCD.",hep,hep-th,On the Standard Approach to Renormalization Group Improvement,"Two approaches to renormalization-group improvement are examined: the substitution of the solutions of running couplings, masses and fields into perturbatively computed quantities is compared with the systematic sum of all the leading log (LL), next-to-leading log (NLL) etc. contributions to radiatively corrected processes, with n-loop expressions for the running quantities being responsible for summing N^{n}LL contributions. A detailed comparison of these procedures is made in the context of the effective potential V in the 4-dimensional O(4) massless $\lambda \phi^{4}$ model, showing the distinction between these procedures at two-loop order when considering the NLL contributions to the effective potential V.",hep,hep-th,1
ATLAS Commander: an ATLAS production tool,"This paper describes the ATLAS production tool AtCom (for ATLAS Commander). The purpose of the tool is to automate as much as possible the task of a production manager: defining and submitting jobs in large quantities, following up upon their execution, scanning log files for known and unknown errors, updating the various ATLAS bookkeeping databases on successful completion of a job whilst cleaning up and resubmitting otherwise. The design of AtCom is modular, separating the generic basic job management functionality from the interactions with the various databases on the one hand, and the computing systems on the other hand. Given the near future reality of different flavors of computing systems (legacy and GRID) deployed concurrently at the various, or even a single ATLAS site, AtCom allows several of them to be used at the same time transparently.",hep,hep-ex,Global Analysis of the Higgs Candidate with Mass ~ 125 GeV,"We analyze the properties of the Higgs candidate with mass ~ 125 GeV discovered by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations, constraining the possible deviations of its couplings from those of a Standard Model Higgs boson. The CMS, ATLAS and Tevatron data are compatible with Standard Model couplings to massive gauge bosons and fermions, and disfavour several types of composite Higgs models unless their couplings resemble those in the Standard Model. We show that the couplings of the Higgs candidate are consistent with a linear dependence on particle masses, scaled by the electroweak scale ~ 246 GeV, the power law and the mass scale both having uncertainties ~ 20%.",hep,hep-ex,1
Concurrent effects of gas drag and planet migration on pebble accretion,"We study the effect of a migrating planet ($10<M_p<20$ Earth mass) on the dynamics of pebbles in a radiative disk using 2D two-fluid simulations carried out with the RoSSBi code. The combined action of the waves induced by the migrating planet and drag back-reaction on the gas produces a complex evolution of the flux of pebbles. The waves excite zonal flows which act as dust traps, and accumulate pebbles. Owing to drag back-reaction, a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops, generating turbulent dust rings containing several Earth masses of solids, where planetesimal formation is likely. The more massive the planet, the faster the dust rings develop. In competition with planet migration, this process triggers several dust rings, with a radial separation scaling as $1/M_p$. We discover a transition around $13$ Earth masses. Below that, pebbles are stopped at the inner side of the planet's orbit, but pebble accretion on the planet is sustained. Above that, drag back-reaction in the dust ring region flattens the pressure profile while the planet migrates, which limits further growth by pebble accretion. This new {\it pebble isolation mass} is about a factor of 2 lower than often reported in the literature. This reduces the overall formation timescale of Super-Earth planets, while favoring their survival after the disk's dissipation because further accretion is stifled. Finally, our results support an hybrid model for the formation of Jupiter via both pebbles and planetesimals accretion.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,Stellar wind-magnetosphere interaction at exoplanets: computations of auroral radio powers,"We present calculations of the auroral radio powers expected from exoplanets with magnetospheres driven by an Earth-like magnetospheric interaction with the solar wind. Specifically, we compute the twin cell-vortical ionospheric flows, currents, and resulting radio powers resulting from a Dungey cycle process driven by dayside and nightside magnetic reconnection, as a function of planetary orbital distance and magnetic field strength. We include saturation of the magnetospheric convection, as observed at the terrestrial magnetosphere, and we present power law approximations for the convection potentials, radio powers and spectral flux densities. We specifically consider a solar-age system and a young (1 Gyr) system. We show that the radio power increases with magnetic field strength for magnetospheres with saturated convection potential, and broadly decreases with increasing orbital distance. We show that the magnetospheric convection at hot Jupiters will be saturated, and thus unable to dissipate the full available incident Poynting flux, such that the magnetic Radiometric Bode's Law (RBL) presents a substantial overestimation of the radio powers for hot Jupiters. Our radio powers for hot Jupiters are $\sim$5-1300 TW for hot Jupiters with field strengths of 0.1-10 $B_J$ orbiting a Sun-like star, while we find that competing effects yield essentially identical powers for hot Jupiters orbiting a young Sun-like star. However, in particular for planets with weaker magnetic fields our powers are higher at larger orbital distances than given by the RBL, and there are many configurations of planet that are expected to be detectable using SKA.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,1
Chern insulators without band inversion in MoS2 monolayers with 3d adatoms,"Electronic and topological properties of MoS2 monolayers endowed with 3d transition metal (TM) adatoms (V-Fe) are explored by using ab initio methods and k.p models. Without the consideration of the Hubbard U interaction, the V, Cr, and Fe adatoms tend to locate on the top of the Mo atoms, while the most stable site for the Mn atom is at the hollow position of the Mo-S hexagon. After the Hubbard U is applied, the most stable sites of all the systems become the top of the Mo atoms. Chern insulators without band inversion are achieved in these systems. The V and Fe adsorption systems are the best candidates to produce the topological states. The k.p model calculations indicate that these topological states are determined by the TM magnetism, the C3v crystal field from the MoS2 substrate, and the TM atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The special two-meron pseudospin texture is found to contribute to the topology. The apparent difference between the Berry curvatures for the V and Fe adsorption systems are also explored. Our results widen the understanding to the Chern insulators and are helpful for the applications of the MoS2 monolayers in the future electronics and spintronics.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Intergranular Hotspots: A Molecular Dynamics Study on the Influence of Compressive and Shear Work,"Numerous crystal- and microstructural-level mechanisms are at play in the formation of hotspots, which are known to govern high explosive initiation behavior. Most of these mechanisms, including pore collapse, interfacial friction, and shear banding, involve both compressive and shear work done within the material and have thus far remained difficult to separate. We assess hotspots formed at shocked crystal-crystal interfaces using quasi-1D molecular dynamics simulations that isolate effects due to compression and shear. Two high explosive materials are considered (TATB and PETN) that exhibit distinctly different levels of molecular conformational flexibility and crystal packing anisotropy. Temperature and intra-molecular strain energy localization in the hotspot is assessed through parametric variation of the crystal orientation and two velocity components that respectively modulate compression and shear work. The resulting hotspots are found to be highly localized to a region within 5-20 nm of the crystal-crystal interface. Compressive work plays a considerably larger role in localizing temperature and intra-molecular strain energy for both materials and all crystal orientations considered. Shear induces a moderate increase in energy localization relative to unsheared cases only for relatively weak compressive shock pressures of approximately 10 GPa. These results help isolate and rank the relative importance of hotspot generation mechanisms and are anticipated to guide the treatment of crystal-crystal interfaces in coarse-grained models of polycrystalline high explosive materials.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Single and double spin asymmetries for deeply virtual Compton scattering measured with CLAS and a longitudinally polarized proton target,"Single-beam, single-target, and double-spin asymmetries for hard exclusive photon production on the proton $\vec{e}\vec{p} \to e' p'\gamma$ are presented. The data were taken at Jefferson Lab using the CLAS detector and a longitudinally polarized ${}^{14}$NH$_3$ target. The three asymmetries were measured in 165 4-dimensional kinematic bins, covering the widest kinematic range ever explored simultaneously for beam and target-polarization observables in the valence quark region. The kinematic dependences of the obtained asymmetries are discussed and compared to the predictions of models of Generalized Parton Distributions. The measurement of three DVCS spin observables at the same kinematic points allows a quasi-model-independent extraction of the imaginary parts of the $H$ and $\tilde{H}$ Compton Form Factors, which give insight into the electric and axial charge distributions of valence quarks in the proton.",nucl,nucl-ex,Measuring light-by-light scattering at the LHC and FCC,"Elastic light-by-light scattering, $\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$, can be measured in electromagnetic interactions of lead (Pb) ions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC), using the large (quasi)real photon fluxes available in ultraperipheral collisions. The $\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$ cross sections for diphoton masses m$_{\gamma\gamma}>$ 5 GeV in pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions at LHC ($\sqrt{\rm s_{_{NN}}}$ = 5.5, 8.8, 14 TeV) and FCC ($\sqrt{\rm s_{_{NN}}}$ = 39, 63, 100 TeV) center-of-mass energies are presented. The measurement has controllable backgrounds in PbPb collisions, and one expects about 70 and 2500 signal events per year at the LHC and FCC respectively, after typical detector acceptance and reconstruction efficiency selections.",nucl,nucl-ex,1
Noncommutative gauge theories on $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$: Perturbatively finite models,"We show that natural noncommutative gauge theory models on $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$ can accommodate gauge invariant harmonic terms, thanks to the existence of a relationship between the center of $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$ and the components of the gauge invariant 1-form canonical connection. This latter object shows up naturally within the present noncommutative differential calculus. Restricting ourselves to positive actions with covariant coordinates as field variables, a suitable gauge-fixing leads to a family of matrix models with quartic interactions and kinetic operators with compact resolvent. Their perturbative behavior is then studied. We first compute the 2-point and 4-point functions at the one-loop order within a subfamily of these matrix models for which the interactions have a symmetric form. We find that the corresponding contributions are finite. We then extend this result to arbitrary order. We find that the amplitudes of the ribbon diagrams for the models of this subfamily are finite to all orders in perturbation. This result extends finally to any of the models of the whole family of matrix models obtained from the above gauge-fixing. The origin of this result is discussed. Finally, the existence of a particular model related to integrable hierarchies is indicated, for which the partition function is expressible as a product of ratios of determinants.",hep,hep-th,Non-Abelian cosmic strings in de Sitter and anti-de Sitter space,"In this paper we investigate the non-Abelian cosmic string in de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes. In order to do that we construct the complete set of equations of motion considering the presence of a cosmological constant. By using numerical analysis we provide the behavior of the Higgs and gauge fields and also for the metric tensor for specific values of the physical parameters of the theory. For de Sitter case, we find the appearance of horizons that although being consequence of the presence of the cosmological constant it strongly depends on the value of the gravitational coupling. In the anti-de Sitter case, we find that the system does not present horizons. In fact the new feature of this system is related with the behavior of the $(00)$ and $(zz)$ components of the metric tensor. They present a strongly increasing for large distance from the string.",hep,hep-th,1
The effect of initial nuclear deformation on dielectron photoproduction in hadronic heavy-ion collisions,"Significant excesses of $e^+e^-$ pair production at very low transverse momentum ($p_T <$ 0.15 GeV/c) were observed by the STAR collaboration in hadronic heavy-ion collisions. Such enhancement is assumed to be a sign of photon-photon production in heavy-ion collisions with hadronic overlap, based on comparisons with model calculations for spherical Au + Au collisions. However, there is a lack of calculations for $e^+e^-$ pair production from coherent photon-photon interactions in hadronic U + U collisions, due to the deformity of Uranium nuclei. In this article, we present calculations for $e^+e^-$ pair photoproduction at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV in both spherical and deformed U + U collisions within STAR detector acceptance using the equivalent photon approximation (EPA). We conduct event-by-event analysis to investigate the effects of initial nuclear deformation on pair production. Our numerical results show good agreement with experimental data for the 40%--60% and 60%--80% centrality classes in U + U collisions, and the differences between spherical and deformed configurations are approximately 3\%. We also calculate the yields of the photoproduced $e^+e^-$ pair in hadronic deformed Ru + Ru and Zr + Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The results reveal that the ratios of the yields of Ru to Zr exhibit very small differences ($<$ 1%) between spherical and deformed cases.",hep,hep-ph,Rapid Thermalization by Baryon Injection in Gauge/Gravity Duality,"Using the AdS/CFT correspondence for strongly coupled gauge theories, we calculate thermalization of mesons caused by a time-dependent change of a baryon number chemical potential. On the gravity side, the thermalization corresponds to a horizon formation on the probe flavor brane in the AdS throat. Since heavy ion collisions are locally approximated by a sudden change of the baryon number chemical potential, we discuss implication of our results to RHIC and LHC experiments, to find a rough estimate of rather rapid thermalization time-scale t_{th} < 1 [fm/c]. We also discuss universality of our analysis against varying gauge theories.",hep,hep-ph,1
Leggett modes and multi-band superconductivity in Sr2RuO4,"Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is a prototypical multi-band superconductor with three bands crossing the Fermi level. These bands exhibit distinct dimensional characteristics, with one quasi-2D $\gamma$-band and two quasi-1D $\alpha$- and $\beta$-bands. This leads to the expectation that the superconductivity on the $\gamma$-band may be only weakly Josephson-coupled to that on the other two bands. Based on an explicit microscopic weak coupling calculation appropriate for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, we study the collective Leggett modes associated with the relative phase oscillations between the bands and show that a relatively soft Leggett mode exists due to the comparatively weaker inter-band Josephson coupling. These calculations also provide insight into why the superconducting gap magnitudes may be comparable on all three bands, despite the noticeable differences between the $\gamma$ and $\alpha, \beta$ bands. The analyses can be readily applied to other multi-band superconductors.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,On the possibility of the fractional ac Josephson effect in non-topological conventional superconductor-normal-superconductor junctions,"Topological superconductors supporting Majorana Fermions with non-abelian statistics are presently a subject of intense theoretical and experimental effort. It has been proposed that the observation of a half-frequency or a fractional Josephson effect is a more reliable test for topological superconductivity than the search for end zero modes. Low-energy end modes can occur accidentally due to impurities. In fact, the fractional Josephson effect has been observed for the semiconductor nanowire system. Here we consider the ac Josephson effect in a conventional s-wave superconductor-normal metal-superconductor junction at a finite voltage. Using a Floquet-Keldysh treatment of the finite voltage junction, we show that the power dissipated from the junction, which measures the ac Josephson effect, can show a peak at half (or even incommensurate fractions) of the Josephson frequency. A similar conclusion is shown to hold for the Shapiro step measurement. The ac fractional Josephson peak can also be understood simply in terms of Landau-Zener processes associated with the Andreev bound state spectrum of the junction.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,1
Disentangling AGN and Star Formation in Soft X-rays,"We have explored the interplay of star formation and AGN activity in soft X-rays (0.5-2 keV) in two samples of Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy2s). Using a combination of low resolution CCD spectra from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we modeled the soft emission of 34 Sy2s using power law and thermal models. For the 11 sources with high signal-to-noise Chandra imaging of the diffuse host galaxy emission, we estimate the luminosity due to star formation by removing the AGN, fitting the residual emission. The AGN and star formation contributions to the soft X-ray luminosity (i.e. L$_{x,AGN}$ and L$_{x,SF}$) for the remaining 24 Sy2s were estimated from the power law and thermal luminosities derived from spectral fitting. These luminosities were scaled based on a template derived from XSINGS analysis of normal star forming galaxies. To account for errors in the luminosities derived from spectral fitting and the spread in the scaling factor, we estimated L$_{x,AGN}$ and L$_{x,SF}$ from Monte Carlo simulations. These simulated luminosities agree with L$_{x,AGN}$ and L$_{x,SF}$ derived from Chandra imaging analysis within a 3\sigma\ confidence level. Using the infrared [NeII]12.8\mu m and [OIV]26\mu m lines as a proxy of star formation and AGN activity, respectively, we independently disentangle the contributions of these two processes to the total soft X-ray emission. This decomposition generally agrees with L$_{x,SF}$ and L$_{x,AGN}$ at the 3\sigma\ level. In the absence of resolvable nuclear emission, our decomposition method provides a reasonable estimate of emission due to star formation in galaxies hosting type 2 AGN.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,The temperature of hot gas halos of early-type galaxies,"Recently, the temperature T and luminosity L_X of the hot gas halos of early type galaxies have been derived with unprecedented accuracy from Chandra data, for 30 galaxies covering a wider range of galactic luminosity (and central velocity dispersion sigma_c) than before. This work investigates the origin of the observed temperatures, by examining the relationship between them and the galaxy structure, the gas heating due to Type Ia supernovae (SNIa's) and the gravitational potential, and the dynamical status of the gas flow. In galaxies with sigma_c<200 km/s, the T's are close to a fiducial average temperature for the gas when in outflow; at 200<sigma_c (km/s)<250, the T's are generally lower than this, and unrelated with sigma_c, which requires a more complex gas flow status; at larger sigma_c, the T's may increase as sigma_c^2, as expected for infall heating, though heating from SNIa's, independent of sigma_c, should be dominant. All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to ~0.5 keV. This additional heating can be provided in the X-ray brightest galaxies by SNIa's and infall heating, with a SNIa's energy input even lower than in standard assumptions; in the X-ray fainter ones it can be provided by SNIa's, whose energy input would be required close to the full standard value at the largest sigma_c. This same energy input, though, would produce temperatures larger than observed at low sigma_c, if entirely thermalized. The values of the observed T's increase from outflows to inflows; the gas is relatively hotter in outflows, though, if the T's are rescaled by the virial temperature. For 200<sigma_c(km/s)<250, lower L_X values tend to correspond to lower T's, which deserves further investigation.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Mesoscopic density-operator in a uniform magnetic field,"A self-consistent linear-response theory for a two-lead mesoscopic structure in Landauer's viewpoint for transport is developed. A density operator relevant in this viewpoint, in a uniform magnetic field is derived. It is shown that this operator differs from the one given in Kubo's viewpoint by a term that represents the self-consistent effects. Hence, a special emphasis is devoted to the diagonal master equation where an exact solution is obtained in the framework of elastic scattering theory.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Theory of electrical spin-detection at a ferromagnet/semiconductor interface,"We present a theoretical model that describes electrical spin-detection at a ferromagnet/semiconductor interface. We show that the sensitivity of the spin detector has strong bias dependence which, in the general case, is dramatically different from that of the tunneling current spin polarization. We show that this bias dependence originates from two distinct physical mechanisms: 1) the bias dependence of tunneling current spin polarization, which is of microscopic origin and depends on the specific properties of the interface, and 2) the macroscopic electron spin transport properties in the semiconductor. Numerical results show that the magnitude of the voltage signal can be tuned over a wide range from the second effect which suggests a universal method for enhancing electrical spin-detection sensitivity in ferromagnet/semiconductor tunnel contacts. Using first-principles calculations we examine the particular case of a Fe/GaAs Schottky tunnel barrier and find very good agreement with experiment. We also predict the bias dependence of the voltage signal for a Fe/MgO/GaAs tunnel structure spin detector.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Soliton disentangling and ferroelectric hysteresis in reconstructed moire superlattices,"Moire materials, created by lattice-mismatch or/and twist-angle, have spurred great interest in excavating novel quantum phases of matter. Latterly, emergent interfacial ferroelectricity has been surprisingly found in spatial inversion symmetry broken systems, such as rhombohedral-stacked bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, the evolution of moire superlattices corresponding to polarization switching and hysteresis is still unclear, which is crucial for giving insight into the interplay between lattice symmetry and band topology, as well as developing optoelectronic memory devices. Here we report on the observation of phonon splitting at strain soliton networks in reconstructed moire superlattices, arising from the twisting and relaxing induced strong three-fold rotational symmetry (C3) breaking. The interval of phonon splitting is tunable by a perpendicular displacement field and exhibits ferroelectric-related hysteresis loops. These phonon evolution features are attributed to the contribution of moire solitons disentangling and lattice viscosity during the motion of domain walls. Moreover, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle moire ferroelectric tunneling junction, whose barrier is modified by net polarization with a tunneling electroresistance of ~10^4. Our work not only reveals the lattice dynamics of moire solitons but also presents a potential pathway for future ferroelectric-based optoelectronic memory devices.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Potential mechanical loss mechanisms in bulk materials for future gravitational wave detectors,"Low mechanical loss materials are needed to further decrease thermal noise in upcoming gravitational wave detectors. We present an analysis of the contribution of Akhieser and thermoelastic damping on the experimental results of resonant mechanical loss measurements. The combination of both processes allows the fit of the experimental data of quartz in the low temperature region (10 K to 25 K). A fully anisotropic numerical calculation over a wide temperature range (10 K to 300 K) reveals, that thermoelastic damping is not a dominant noise source in bulk silicon samples. The anisotropic numerical calculation is sucessfully applied to the estimate of thermoelastic noise of an advanced LIGO sized silicon test mass.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Densities of states in Fe-doped III-V semiconductors: a first-principles study,"The electronic structures of Fe-doped III-V semiconductors were studied by first-principles supercell calculation. It was found that their electronic structures are basically the same as those of Mn-doped ones except that the extra electron of Fe compared to Mn occupies either majority-spin $p$-$d$ hybridized antibonding states ($t_{a,\uparrow}$) or minority-spin $e$ states ($e_{\downarrow}$) and that the center of gravity of the $d$ partial density of states is higher for Fe than for Mn. The present calculations suggest that ferromagnetism appears when the $e_{\downarrow}$ states start to be occupied. The band splitting due to $s$-$d$ hybridization was found to be significantly smaller than the one due to $p$-$d$ hybridization. This indicates that the $s,p$-$d$ exchange interaction is not responsible for the high-temperature ferromagnetism of the Fe-doped ferromagnetic semiconductors even in $n$-type compounds.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Singularities of Magnetic and Elastic Characteristics of La2/3Ba1/3MnO3: Analysis of Martensitic Kinetics,A coordinated temperature behavior of magnetic susceptibility and internal friction has been observed in the La2/3Ba1/3MnO3 manganite in the temperature region of the crystal phase separation 5-340 K. Stepwise temperature behavior of the susceptibility of the single crystal sample and corresponding singular behavior of the internal friction in the polycrystalline manganite have been found. These small-scale features of the temperature dependences of the susceptibility and the internal friction are considered to be a reflection of martensitic kinetics of the structural phase transformation R3c-Imma in the 200 K temperature region.,cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
String bits and the Myers effect,"Based on the non-abelian effective action for D1-branes, a new action for matrix string theory in non-trivial backgrounds is proposed.

A complete quasi-classical model,"This is the first of two papers presenting different versions of quasi-classical toy models for the non-singular evolution of the geometry and the associated effective stress-energy tensor for a spherically symmetric black hole that evolves into a white hole and eventually disappears after evaporating down to the Planck scale. The ansatz for the geometry is inspired by calculations of the semi-classical stress-energy tensor in the Schwarzschild background and ideas from loop quantum gravity for a nonsingular transition to the white hole. In this paper the main emphasis is on the evolution of the black hole, and the evolution of the white hole is assumed to be essentially the time reverse of that of the black hole. The negative energy of the Hawking ""partners"" flows out of the white hole to future null infinity. The white hole disappears when the matter and radiation that collapsed to form the black hole emerges. I discuss the compatibility of the model with some of the quantum energy conditions proposed in the literature, and, briefly, the implications for the interpretation of black hole entropy. The second paper considers how the evolution of the white hole can be modified to avoid prolonged emission of negative energy.",hep,hep-th,1
On the finite temperature Drude weight of the anisotropic Heisenberg chain,"We present a study of the Drude weight $D(T)$ of the spin-1/2 $XXZ$ chain in the gapless regime. The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) is applied in two different ways. In the first application we employ the particle basis of magnons and their bound states. In this case we rederive and considerably extend earlier work in the literature. However, in the course of our investigation we find arguments that cast doubt on the applicability of the TBA in this case. In a second application by use of the spinon and anti-spinon particle basis we obtain completely different results. Only for anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ close to 0 we find that $D(T)$ is a monotonously decaying function of temperature. For $\Delta$ close to 1 the behaviour is entirely different showing a finite temperature maximum. Also for the isotropic antiferromagnetic chain ($\Delta=1$) the results for $D(T)$ are finite for T=0 as well as for $T>0$ with an infinite positive slope at T=0.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,"Interplay of electron correlations, spin-orbit couplings, and structural effects for Cu centers in the quasi-two-dimensional magnet InCu$_{2/3}$V$_{1/3}$O$_3$","Less common ligand coordination of transition-metal centers is often associated with peculiar valence-shell electron configurations and outstanding physical properties. One example is the Fe$^+$ ion with linear coordination, actively investigated in the research area of single-molecule magnetism. Here we address the nature of 3$d^9$ states for Cu$^{2+}$ ions sitting in the center of trigonal bipyramidal ligand cages in the quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb compound InCu$_{2/3}$V$_{1/3}$O$_3$, whose unusual magnetic properties were intensively studied in the recent past. In particular, we discuss the interplay of structural effects, electron correlations, and spin-orbit couplings in this material. A relevant computational finding is a different sequence of the Cu ($xz$, $yz$) and ($xy$, $x^2\!-\!y^2$) levels as compared to existing electronic-structure models, which has implications for the interpretation of various excitation spectra. Spin-orbit interactions, both first- and second-order, turn out to be stronger than previously assumed, suggesting that rather rich single-ion magnetic properties can be in principle achieved also for the 3$d^9$ configuration by properly adjusting the sequence of crystal-field states for such less usual ligand coordination.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
All-Optical Formation of Quantum Degenerate Mixtures,"We report the realization of quantum degenerate mixed gases of ytterbium (Yb) isotopes using all-optical methods. We have succeeded in cooling attractively interacting 176Yb atoms via sympathetic cooling down to below the Bose-Einstein transition temperature, coexisting with a stable condensate of 174Yb atoms with a repulsive interaction. We have observed a rapid atom loss in 176Yb atoms after cooling down below the transition temperature, which indicates the collapse of a 176Yb condensate. The sympathetic cooling technique has been applied to cool a 173Yb-174Yb Fermi-Bose mixture to the quantum degenerate regime.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,Detecting the tunneling rates for strongly interacting fermions on optical lattices,"Strongly interacting fermionic atoms on optical lattices are studied through a Hubbard-like model Hamiltonian, in which tunneling rates of atoms and molecules between neighboring sites are assumed to be different. In the limit of large onsite repulsion U, the model is shown to reproduce the t-J Hamiltonian, in which the J coefficient of the Heisenberg term depends on the particle-assisted tunneling rate g: explicitly, $J=4 g^2/U$. At half-filling, g drives a crossover from a Brinkman-Rice paramagnetic insulator of fully localized atoms (g=0) to the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator of the standard Hubbard case (g=t). This is observed already at the intermediate coupling regime in the number of doubly occupied sites, thus providing a criterion to extract from measurements the effective value of g.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,1
Vector Curvaton with varying Kinetic Function,"A new model realisation of the vector curvaton paradigm is presented and analysed. The model consists of a single massive Abelian vector field, with a Maxwell type kinetic term. By assuming that the kinetic function and the mass of the vector field are appropriately varying during inflation, it is shown that a scale invariant spectrum of superhorizon perturbations can be generated. These perturbations can contribute to the curvature perturbation of the Universe. If the vector field remains light at the end of inflation it is found that it can generate substantial statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and bispectrum of the curvature perturbation. In this case the non-Gaussianity in the curvature perturbation is predominantly anisotropic, which will be a testable prediction in the near future. If, on the other hand, the vector field is heavy at the end of inflation then it is demonstrated that particle production is approximately isotropic and the vector field alone can give rise to the curvature perturbation, without directly involving any fundamental scalar field. The parameter space for both possibilities is shown to be substantial. Finally, toy-models are presented which show that the desired variation of the mass and kinetic function of the vector field can be realistically obtained, without unnatural tunings, in the context of supergravity or superstrings.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,On the gauge dependence of gravitational waves generated at second order from scalar perturbations,"We revisit and clarify the gauge dependence of gravitational waves generated at second order from scalar perturbations. In a universe dominated by a perfect fluid with a constant equation-of-state parameter $w$, we compute the energy density of such induced gravitational waves in the Newtonian, comoving, and uniform curvature gauges. Huge differences are found between the Newtonian and comoving gauge results for any $w \,(\ge 0)$. This is always caused by the perturbation of the shift vector. Interestingly, the Newtonian and uniform curvature gauge calculations give the same energy density for $w>0$. In the case of $w=0$, the uniform curvature gauge result differs only by a factor from that of the comoving gauge, but deviates significantly from that of the Newtonian gauge.

Radiative coupling and weak lasing of exciton-polariton condensates,"In spite of having finite life-time exciton-polaritons in microcavities are known to condense at strong enough pumping of the reservoir. We present an analytical theory of such Bose-condensates on a set of localized one-particle states: condensation centers. To understand physics of these arrays one has to supplement the Josephson coupling by the radiative coupling caused by the interference of the light emitted by different centers. Combination of these couplings with the one-site interaction between the bosons leads to a rich nonlinear dynamics. In particular, a new regime of radiation appears. We call it weak lasing: the centers have macroscopic occupations and radiate coherently, but the coupling alone is sufficient for stabilization. The system can have several stable states and switch between them. Moreover, the time reversal symmetry in this regime is, as a rule, broken. A number of existing experimental puzzles find natural interpretation in the framework of this theory.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Sub-picosecond molecular dynamics modulate the energies of spin states for hundreds of nanoseconds,"Molecular vibrations are increasingly seen as a key factor for spin dynamics in single-ion magnets and molecular spin qubits. Herein we show how an inexpensive combination of molecular dynamics calculations and a crystal field analysis can be employed to obtain a dynamical picture of the crystal field splitting. We present the time evolution during 500ns of the spin energy levels in a terbium complex. Our calculations evidence an amplitude of up to tens of cm-1 for the oscillations of the spin energy levels in the fs time scale. Crucially, we also see that the oscillations average out and practically disappear at longer time scales, thus ruling out the modulation of spin energy levels by phonons of long wavelength $\lambda$ (up to $\lambda$ = 40 $\AA$). Our results are compatible with the common approximation of focusing on local vibrations, but at the same time highlight the risks of assuming that the spin energy levels are time- and temperature-independent.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Mechanisms of SiO oxidation: Implications for dust formation,"Reactions of SiO molecules have been postulated to initiate efficient formation of silicate dust particles in outflows around dying (AGB) stars. Both OH radicals and H$_2$O molecules can be present in these environments and their reactions with SiO and the smallest SiO cluster, Si$_2$O$_2$, affect the efficiency of eventual dust formation. Rate coefficients of gas-phase oxidation and clustering reactions of SiO, Si$_2$O$_2$ and Si$_2$O$_3$ have been calculated using master equation calculations based on density functional theory calculations. The calculations show that the reactions involving OH are fast. Reactions involving H$_2$O are not efficient routes to oxidation but may under the right conditions lead to hydroxylated species. The reaction of Si$_2$O$_2$ with H$_2$O, which has been suggested as efficient producing Si$_2$O$_3$, is therefore not as efficient as previously thought. If H$_2$O molecules dissociate to form OH radicals, oxidation of SiO and dust formation could be accelerated. Kinetics simulations of oxygen-rich circumstellar environments using our proposed reaction scheme suggest that under typical conditions only small amounts of SiO$_2$ and Si$_2$O$_2$ are formed and that most of the silicon remains as molecular SiO.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Cosmic evolution of the H2 mass density and the epoch of molecular gas,"We present new empirical constraints on the evolution of $\rho_{\rm H_2}$, the cosmological mass density of molecular hydrogen, back to $z\approx2.5$. We employ a statistical approach measuring the average observed $850\mu{\rm m}$ flux density of near-infrared selected galaxies as a function of redshift. The redshift range considered corresponds to a span where the $850\mu{\rm m}$ band probes the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of thermal dust emission in the rest-frame, and can therefore be used as an estimate of the mass of the interstellar medium (ISM). Our sample comprises of ${\approx}150,000$ galaxies in the UKIDSS-UDS field with near-infrared magnitudes $K_{\rm AB}\leq25$ mag and photometric redshifts with corresponding probability distribution functions derived from deep 12-band photometry. With a sample approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than in previous works we significantly reduce statistical uncertainties on $\rho_{\rm H_2}$ to $z\approx2.5$. Our measurements are in broad agreement with recent direct estimates from blank field molecular gas surveys, finding that the epoch of molecular gas coincides with the peak epoch of star formation with $\rho_{\rm H_2}\approx2\times10^7\,{\rm M_\odot}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z\approx2$. We demonstrate that $\rho_{\rm H_2}$ can be broadly modelled by inverting the star-formation rate density with a fixed or weakly evolving star-formation efficiency. This 'constant efficiency' model shows a similar evolution to our statistically derived $\rho_{\rm H_2}$, indicating that the dominant factor driving the peak star formation history at $z\approx2$ is a larger supply of molecular gas in galaxies rather than a significant evolution of the star-formation rate efficiency within individual galaxies.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Formation and Reconnection of Three-dimensional Current Sheets with a Guide Field in the Solar Corona,"We analyze a series of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection in a model solar corona to study the effect of the guide field component on quasi-steady state interchange reconnection in a pseudostreamer arcade configuration. This work extends the analysis of \citet{Edmondson2010b} by quantifying the mass density enhancement coherency scale in the current sheet associated with magnetic island formation during the nonlinear phase of plasmoid-unstable reconnection. We compare the results of four simulations of a zero, weak, moderate, and a strong guide field, $B_{GF}/B_0 = \lbrace 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 \rbrace$, to quantify the plasmoid density enhancement's longitudinal and transverse coherency scales as a function of the guide field strength. We derive these coherency scales from autocorrelation and wavelet analyses, and demonstrate how these scales may be used to interpret the density enhancement fluctuation's Fourier power spectra in terms of a structure formation range, an energy continuation range, and an inertial range---each population with a distinct spectral slope. We discuss the simulation results in the context of solar and heliospheric observations of pseudostreamer solar wind outflow and possible signatures of reconnection-generated structure.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,The Hydrodynamic Origin of Neutron Star Kicks,"We present results from a suite of axisymmetric, core-collapse supernova simulations in which hydrodynamic recoil from an asymmetric explosion produces large proto-neutron star (PNS) velocities. We use the adaptive-mesh refinement code CASTRO to self-consistently follow core-collapse, the formation of the PNS and its subsequent acceleration. We obtain recoil velocities of up to 620 km/s at ~1 s after bounce. These velocities are consistent with the observed distribution of pulsar kicks and with PNS velocities obtained in other theoretical calculations. Our PNSs are still accelerating at several hundred km/s at the end of our calculations, suggesting that even the highest velocity pulsars may be explained by hydrodynamic recoil in generic, core-collapse supernovae.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1

To reduce the computational effort further, we also introduce two approximate coupling strategies. The resulting schemes are compared numerically to a fully compressible scheme and show good agreement with these standard algorithm at lower numerical costs.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,1
Feedback from Reorienting AGN Jets,"[abridged] Aims: We test the effects of re-orienting jets from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) on the intracluster medium in a galaxy cluster environment with short central cooling time. We investigate appearance and properties of the resulting cavities, and the efficiency of jets in providing near-isotropic heating to the cooling cluster core. Methods: We use numerical simulations to explore four models of jets over several active/inactive cycles. We keep the jet power and duration fixed, varying only the jet angle prescription. We track the total energy of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the cluster core over time, and the fraction of the jet energy transferred to the ICM, paying attention to where the energy is deposited. We also compare synthetic X-ray images of the simulated cluster to actual observations. Results: Jets whose re-orientation is minimal ($\lesssim 20^{\circ}$) typically produce conical structures of interconnected cavities, with the opening angle of the cones being $\sim 15-20^{\circ}$, extending to $\sim 300$ kpc from the cluster centre. Such jets transfer about $60\%$ of their energy to the ICM, yet they are not very efficient at heating the cluster core, as the jet energy is deposited further out. Jets that re-orient by $\gtrsim 20^{\circ}$ generally produce multiple pairs of detached cavities. Although smaller, these cavities are inflated within the central 50~kpc and are more isotropically distributed, resulting in more effective heating of the core. Such jets, over few hundreds Myr, can deposit up to $80\%$ of their energy where it is required. Consequently, these models come the closest to an heating/cooling balance and to mitigating runaway cooling of the core, even though all models have identical power/duration profiles. Additionally, the corresponding synthetic X-ray images exhibit structures closely resembling those seen in real cool-core clusters.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,High-resolution observations of the symbiotic system R Aqr. Direct imaging of the gravitational effects of the secondary on the stellar wind,"We have observed the symbiotic stellar system R Aqr, aiming to describe the gravitational interaction between the white dwarf (WD) and the wind from the Mira star, the key phenomenon driving the symbiotic activity and the formation of nebulae in such systems. We present high-resolution ALMA maps of the 12CO and 13CO J=3-2 lines, the 0.9 mm continuum distribution, and some high-excitation molecular lines in R Aqr. The maps, which have resolutions ranging between 40 milliarcsecond (mas) and less than 20 mas, probe the circumstellar regions at suborbital scales as the distance between the stars is ~ 40 mas. Our observations show the gravitational effects of the secondary on the stellar wind. The AGB star was identified in our maps from the continuum and molecular line data, and we estimated the probable position of the secondary from a new estimation of the orbital parameters. The (preliminary) comparison of our maps with theoretical predictions is surprisingly satisfactory and the main expected gravitational effects are directly mapped for the first time. We find a strong focusing in the equatorial plane of the resulting wind, which shows two plumes in opposite directions that have different velocities and very probably correspond to the expected double spiral due to the interaction. Our continuum maps show the very inner regions of the nascent bipolar jets, at scales of some AU. Continuum maps obtained with the highest resolution show the presence of a clump that very probably corresponds to the emission of the ionized surroundings of the WD and of a bridge of material joining both stars, which is likely material flowing from the AGB primary to the accretion disk around the WD secondary.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Neutral pion and $\eta$ meson production in p-Pb collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV,"Neutral pion and $\eta$ meson invariant differential yields were measured in non-single diffractive p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC. The analysis combines results from three complementary photon measurements, utilizing the PHOS and EMCal calorimeters and the Photon Conversion Method. The invariant differential yields of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ meson inclusive production are measured near mid-rapidity in a broad transverse momentum range of $0.3<p_{\rm T}< 20$ GeV/$c$ and $0.7<p_{\rm T}<20$ GeV/$c$, respectively. The measured $\eta$/$\pi^{0}$ ratio increases with $p_{\rm T}$ and saturates for $p_{\rm T} > 4$ GeV/$c$ at $0.483\pm 0.015_{\rm stat}\pm 0.015_{\rm sys}$. A deviation from $m_{\rm T}$ scaling is observed for $p_{\rm T}<2$ GeV/$c$. The measured $\eta$/$\pi^{0}$ ratio is consistent with previous measurements from proton-nucleus and pp collisions over the full $p_{\rm T}$ range. The measured $\eta$/$\pi^{0}$ ratio at high $p_{\rm T}$ also agrees within uncertainties with measurements from nucleus-nucleus collisions. The $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ yields in p-Pb relative to the scaled pp interpolated reference, $R_{\rm pPb}$, are presented for $0.3<p_{\rm T}<20$ GeV/$c$ and $0.7<p_{\rm T}< 20$ GeV/$c$, respectively. The results are compared with theoretical model calculations. The values of $R_{\rm pPb}$ are consistent with unity for transverse momenta above 2 GeV/$c$. These results support the interpretation that the suppressed yield of neutral mesons measured in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies is due to parton energy loss in the hot QCD medium.",nucl,nucl-ex,First observation of an attractive interaction between a proton and a multi-strange baryon,"This work presents the first experimental observation of the attractive strong interaction between a proton and a multi-strange baryon (hyperon) $\Xi^-$. The result is extracted from two-particle correlations of combined $\rm{p}-\Xi^{-}$$\oplus$$\rm{\bar{p}}-\bar{\Xi}^{+}$ pairs measured in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV at the LHC with ALICE. The measured correlation function is compared with the prediction obtained assuming only an attractive Coulomb interaction and a standard deviation in the range $[3.6,5.3]$ is found. Since the measured $\rm{p}-\Xi^{-}$$\oplus$$\rm{\bar{p}}-\bar{\Xi}^{+}$ correlation is significantly enhanced with respect to the Coulomb prediction, the presence of an additional, strong, attractive interaction is evident. The data are compatible with recent lattice calculations by the HAL-QCD Collaboration, with a standard deviation in the range $ [1.8,3.7]$. The lattice potential predicts a shallow repulsive $\Xi^-$ interaction within pure neutron matter at saturation densities and this implies stiffer equations of state for neutron-rich matter including hyperons. Implications of the strong interaction for the modeling of neutron stars are discussed.",nucl,nucl-ex,1
Turning drops into bubbles: Elastic cavitation by diffusion,"Some members of the vegetal kingdom can achieve surprisingly fast movements making use of a clever combination of evaporation, elasticity and cavitation. In this process, enthalpic energy is transformed into elastic energy and suddenly released in a cavitation event which produces kinetic energy. Here we study this uncommon energy transformation by a model system: a droplet in an elastic medium shrinks slowly by diffusion and eventually transforms into a bubble by a rapid cavitation event. The experiments reveal the cavity dynamics over the extremely disparate timescales of the process, spanning 9 orders of magnitude. We model the initial shrinkage as a classical diffusive process, while the sudden bubble growth and oscillations are described using an inertial-(visco)elastic model, in excellent agreement with the experiments. Such a model system could serve as a new paradigm for motile synthetic materials.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,"Physics of drying complex fluid drop: flow field, pattern formation, and desiccation cracks","Drying complex fluids is a common phenomenon where a liquid phase transforms into a dense or porous solid. This transformation involves several physical processes, such as the diffusion of liquid molecules into the surrounding atmosphere and the movement of dispersed phases through evaporation-driven flow. As a result, the solute forming a dried deposit exhibits unique patterns and often displays structural defects like desiccation cracks, buckling, or wrinkling. Various drying configurations have been utilized to study the drying of colloids, the process of their consolidation, and fluid-flow dynamics. This review focuses on the drying of colloids and the related phenomena, specifically the drying-induced effects observed during sessile drop drying. We first present a theoretical overview of the physics of drying pure and binary liquid droplets, followed by drying colloidal droplets. Then, we explain the phenomena of pattern formation and desiccation cracks. Additionally, the article briefly describes the impact of evaporation-driven flows on the accumulation of particles and various physical parameters that influence deposit patterns and cracks.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,1
Earthquake magnitude distribution and aftershocks: a statistical geometry explanation,"The emergence of a power-law distribution for the energy released during an earthquake is investigated in several models. Generic features are identified which are based on the self-affine behavior of the stress field prior to an event. This field behaves at large scale as a random trajectory in 1 dimension of space and a random surface in 2 dimensions. Using concepts of statistical mechanics and results on the properties of these random objects, several predictions are obtained and verified, in particular the value of the power-law exponent of the earthquake energy distribution (the Gutenberg-Richter law) as well as a mechanism for the existence of aftershocks after a large earthquake (the Omori law).",physics,physics.geo-ph,Sensitivity of Love and quasi-Rayleigh waves to model parameters,"We examine the sensitivity of the Love and the quasi-Rayleigh waves to model parameters. Both waves are guided waves that propagate in the same model of an elastic layer above an elastic halfspace. We study their dispersion curves without any simplifying assumptions, beyond the standard approach of elasticity theory in isotropic media. We examine the sensitivity of both waves to elasticity parameters, frequency and layer thickness, for varying frequency and different modes. In the case of Love waves, we derive and plot the absolute value of a dimensionless sensitivity coefficient in terms of partial derivatives, and perform an analysis to find the optimum frequency for determining the layer thickness. For a coherency of the background information, we briefly review the Love-wave dispersion relation and provide details of the less common derivation of the quasi-Rayleigh relation in an appendix. We compare that derivation to past results in the literature, finding certain discrepancies among them.",physics,physics.geo-ph,1
The Dunhuang chinese sky: a comprehensive study of the oldest known star atlas,"This paper presents an analysis of the star atlas included in the medieval Chinese manuscript (Or.8210/S.3326), discovered in 1907 by the archaeologist Aurel Stein at the Silk Road town of Dunhuang and now held in the British Library. Although partially studied by a few Chinese scholars, it has never been fully displayed and discussed in the Western world. This set of sky maps (12 hour angle maps in quasi-cylindrical projection and a circumpolar map in azimuthal projection), displaying the full sky visible from the Northern hemisphere, is up to now the oldest complete preserved star atlas from any civilisation. It is also the first known pictorial representation of the quasi-totality of the Chinese constellations. This paper describes the history of the physical object - a roll of thin paper drawn with ink. We analyse the stellar content of each map (1339 stars, 257 asterisms) and the texts associated with the maps. We establish the precision with which the maps are drawn (1.5 to 4 degrees for the brightest stars) and examine the type of projections used. We conclude that precise mathematical methods were used to produce the atlas. We also discuss the dating of the manuscript and its possible author and confirm the dates 649-684 (early Tang dynasty) as most probable based on available evidence. This is at variance with a prior estimate around +940. Finally we present a brief comparison with later sky maps, both in China and in Europe.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Solar System Physics for Exoplanet Research,"Over the past three decades, we have witnessed one of the great revolutions in our understanding of the cosmos - the dawn of the Exoplanet Era. Where once we knew of just one planetary system (the Solar system), we now know of thousands, with new systems being announced on a weekly basis. Of the thousands of planetary systems we have found to date, however, there is only one that we can study up-close and personal - the Solar system. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the Solar system for the exoplanetary science community - with a focus on the processes thought to have shaped the system we see today. In section one, we introduce the Solar system as a single well studied example of the many planetary systems now observed. In section two, we describe the Solar system's small body populations as we know them today - from the two hundred and five known planetary satellites to the various populations of small bodies that serve as a reminder of the system's formation and early evolution. In section three, we consider our current knowledge of the Solar system's planets, as physical bodies. In section four, we discuss the research that has been carried out into the Solar system's formation and evolution, with a focus on the information gleaned as a result of detailed studies of the system's small body populations. In section five, we discuss our current knowledge of planetary systems beyond our own - both in terms of the planets they host, and in terms of the debris that we observe orbiting their host stars. As we learn ever more about the diversity and ubiquity of other planetary systems, our Solar system will remain the key touchstone that facilitates our understanding and modelling of those newly found systems, and we finish section five with a discussion of the future surveys that will further expand that knowledge.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Bose-Einstein condensation in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory,"In this paper we study the corrections emergent from a Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz extension of the complex scalar sector to the Bose-Einstein condensation and to the thermodynamics parameters. We initially discussed some features of the model to only then compute the corrections to the Bose-Einstein condensation. The calculations were done by computing the generating functional, from which we extract the thermodynamics parameters. We also obtained the Lifshitz scaling correction for the critical temperature $T_c$ that sets the Bose-Einstein Condensation.",hep,hep-th,CONNECTIONS of the LIOUVILLE MODEL and XXZ SPIN CHAIN,"The quantum theory of the Liouville model with imaginary field is considered using the quantum inverse scattering method. An integrable structure with nontrivial spectral parameter dependence is developed for lattice Liouville theory by scaling the $L$-matrix of lattice sine-Gordon theory. This $L$-matrix yields Bethe Ansatz equations for Liouville theory, by the methods of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. Using the string picture of exited Bethe states, the lattice Liouville Bethe equations are mapped to the corresponding equations for the spin 1/2 XXZ chain. The well developed theory of finite size corrections in spin chains is used to deduce the conformal properties of the lattice Liouville Bethe states. The unitary series of conformal field theories emerge for Liouville couplings of the form $\gam = \pi\frac{\nu}{\nu+1}$, corresponding to root of unity XXZ anisotropies. The Bethe states give the full spectrum of the corresponding unitary conformal field theory, with the primary states in the \Kac table parameterized by a string length $K$, and the remnant of the chain length mod $(\nu+1)$.",hep,hep-th,1
Compact Modeling of pH-Sensitive FETs Based on Two-Dimensional Semiconductors,"We present a physics-based circuit-compatible model for pH-sensitive field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional (2D) materials. The electrostatics along the electrolyte-gated 2D-semiconductor stack is treated by solving the Poisson equation including the Site-Binding model and the Gouy-Chapman-Stern approach, while the carrier transport is described by the drift-diffusion theory. The proposed model is provided in an analytical form and then implemented in Verilog-A, making it compatible with standard technology computer-aided design tools employed for circuit simulation.

Highly variable young massive stars in ATLASGAL clumps,"High-amplitude variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is usually associated with episodic accretion events. It has not been observed so far in massive YSOs. Here, the high-amplitude variable star sample of ContrerasPe\~{n}a et al.(2016) has been used to search for highly-variable($\Delta$K$\ge$1\,mag) sources coinciding with dense clumps mapped using the 850\mum continuum emission by the ATLASGAL survey. 18 variable sources are centred on the sub-mm clump peaks, and coincide ($<$1"") with a 24$\mu$m point or compact ($<$10"") source. 13 of these 18 sources can be fit by YSO models. The 13 variable YSOs(VYSO) have luminosities of $\sim$10$^3$ L$_{\odot}$, an average mass of 8 M$_{\odot}$ and a range of ages up to 10$^6$ yr. 11 of these 13 VYSOs are located in the midst of infrared dark clouds. 9 of the 13 sources have $\Delta$K$>$2 mag, significantly higher compared to the mean variability of the entire VVV sample. The light curves of these objects sampled between 2010-2015 display rising, declining, or quasi-periodic behaviour but no clear periodicity. Light-curve analysis using Plavchan method show that the most prominent phased signals have periods of a few hundred days. The nature and time-scale of variations found in 6.7 Ghz methanol maser emission (MME) in massive stars are similar to that of the VYSO light curves. We argue that the origin of the observed variability is episodic accretion. We suggest that the timescale of a few hundred days may represent the frequency at which a spiralling disk feeds dense gas to the young massive star.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,The Hamburg/ESO R-process Enhanced Star survey (HERES) VI. The Galactic Chemical Evolution of Silicon,"We determined the silicon abundances of 253 metal-poor stars in the metallicity range $-4<\mathrm{[Fe/H]} <-1.5$, based on non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation calculations of neutral silicon and high-resolution spectra obtained with VLT-UT2/UVES. The $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ dependence of [Si/Fe] noticed in previous investigation is diminished in our abundance analysis due to the inclusion of NLTE effects. An increasing slope of [Si/Fe] towards decreasing metallicity is present in our results, in agreement with Galactic chemical evolution models. The small intrinsic scatter of [Si/Fe] in our sample may imply that these stars formed in a region where the yields of type II supernovae were mixed into a large volume, or that the formation of these stars was strongly clustered, even if the ISM was enriched by single SNa II in a small mixing volume. We identified two dwarfs with $\mathrm{[Si/Fe]}\sim +1.0$: HE 0131$-$3953, and HE 1430$-$1123. These main-sequence turnoff stars are also carbon-enhanced. They might have been pre-enriched by sub-luminous supernovae.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Universal relaxation function in nonextensive systems,We have derived the dipolar relaxation function for a cluster model whose volume distribution was obtained from the generalized maximum Tsallis nonextensive entropy principle. The power law exponents of the relaxation function are simply related to a global fractal parameter $\alpha$ and for large time to the entropy nonextensivity parameter $q$. For intermediate times the relaxation follows a stretched exponential behavior. The asymptotic power law behaviors both in the time and the frequency domains coincide with those of the Weron generalized dielectric function derived from an extension of the Levy central limit theorem. They are in full agreement with the Jonscher universality principle. Moreover our model gives a physical interpretation of the mathematical parameters of the Weron stochastic theory and opens new paths to understand the ubiquity of self-similarity and power laws in the relaxation of large classes of materials in terms of their fractal and nonextensive properties.,cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Coarsening dynamics of binary liquids with active rotation,"Active matter comprised of many self-driven units can exhibit emergent collective behaviors such as pattern formation and phase separation in both biologica and synthetic systems. While these behaviors are increasingly well understood for ensembles of linearly self-propelled particles, less is known about the collective behaviors of active rotating particles where energy input at the particle level gives rise to rotational particle motion. A recent simulation study revealed that active rotation can induce phase separation in mixtures of counter-rotating particles in 2D. In contrast to that of linearly self-propelled particles, the phase separation of counter-rotating fluids is accompanied by steady convective flows that originate at the fluid-fluid interface. Here, we investigate the influence of these flows on the coarsening dynamics of actively rotating binary liquids using a phenomenological, hydrodynamic model that combines a Cahn-Hilliard equation for the fluid composition with a Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. The effect of active rotation is introduced though an additional force within the Navier-Stokes equations that arises due to gradients in the concentrations of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating particles. Depending on the strength of active rotation and that of frictional interactions with the stationary surroundings, we observe and explain new dynamical behaviors such as ""active coarsening"" via self-generated flows as well as the emergence of self-propelled vortex doublets. We confirm that many of the qualitative behaviors identified by the continuum model can also be found in discrete, particle-based simulations of actively rotating liquids. Our results highlight further opportunities for achieving complex dissipative structures in active materials subject to distributed actuation.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Stationary Spiral Structure and Collective Motion of the Stars in a Spiral Galaxy,"Most fully developed galaxies have a vivid spiral structure, but the formation and evolution of the spiral structure are still an enigma in astrophysics. In this paper, according to the standard Newtonian gravitational theory and some observational facts, we derive an idealized model for spiral galaxy, and give a natural explanation to the spiral structure. We solve some analytic solutions to a spiral galaxy, and obtain manifest relations between density and speed. From the solution we get some interesting results: (I) The spiral pattern is a stationary or static structure of density wave, and the barred galaxy globally rotate around an axis at tiny angular speed. (II) All stars in the disc of a barred spiral galaxy move in almost circular orbits. (III) In the spiral arms, the speed of stars takes minimum and the stellar density takes maximum. (IV) The mass-energy density of the dark halo is compensatory for that of the disc, namely, it takes minimum in the spiral arms. This phenomenon might reflect the complicated stream lines of the dark halo.",physics,physics.gen-ph,Imprints of Discrete Space Time - A Brief Note,We point out that the observed decay mode of the pion and the Kaon decay puzzle are really imprints of discrete micro space-time.,physics,physics.gen-ph,1
Bessel beams revisited: a generalized scheme to derive optical vortices,"The electromagnetic field of optical vortices is in most cases derived from vector and scalar potentials using either a procedure based on the Lorenz or the Coulomb gauge. The former procedure has been typically used to derive paraxial solutions with Laguerre-Gauss radial profiles, while the latter procedure has been used to derive full solutions of the wave equation with Bessel radial profiles. We investigate the differences in the derivation procedures applying each one to both Bessel and Laguerre-Gauss profiles. We show that the electromagnetic fields thus derived differ in the relative strength of electric and magnetic contributions. The new solution that arises from the Lorenz procedure in the case of Bessel beams restores a field symmetry that previous work failed to resolve. Our procedure is further generalized and we find a spectrum of fields beyond the Lorenz and Coulomb gauge types. Finally, we describe a possible experiment to test our findings.",physics,physics.optics,Room-temperature Continuous-wave Lasing from Monolayer Molybdenum Ditelluride with a Silicon Nanobeam Cavity,"Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide the most efficient optical gain materials and have potential for making nanolasers with the smallest gain media with lowest energy consumption. But lasing demonstrations based on TMDs have so far been limited to low temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the first room-temperature laser operation in the infrared wavelengths from a monolayer of molybdenum ditelluride on a silicon photonic-crystal nanobeam cavity. Our demonstration is made possible by a unique choice of TMD material with emission wavelength below silicon absorption, combined with the high Q-cavity design by silicon nanobeam. Lasing at 1132 nm is demonstrated at room-temperature pumped by a continuous-wave laser, with a threshold density at 6.6 W/cm2. The room-temperature linewidth of 0.202 nm is the narrowest with the corresponding Q of 5603, the largest observed for a TMD laser. This demonstration establishes TMDs as practical nanolaser materials. The silicon structures provide additional benefits for silicon-compatible nanophotonic applications in the important infrared wavelengths.",physics,physics.optics,1
Tuning correlation effects with electron-phonon interactions,"We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double kondo peak arrangement",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Extent of frustration in the classical Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model via bond anisotropy,"In the pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ honeycomb Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling, there are two types of bond-dependent exchange interactions, named Kitaev ($K$) and $\Gamma$, leading to strong frustration. While the ground state of the Kitaev model is a quantum spin liquid with fractionalized excitations, the ground state of the $\Gamma$ model remains controversial. In particular, the phase diagram of the $K\Gamma$ model with ferromagnetic $K$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma$ interactions has been intensively studied because of its relevance to candidate materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. Numerical studies also included the effects of tuning the bond strengths, i.e., $z$-bond strength different from the other bonds. However, no clear consensus on the overall phase diagram has been reached yet. Here we study the classical $K\Gamma$ model with the anisotropic bond strength using Monte Carlo simulations to understand the emerging phases out of competition between the two frustrated limits. We also address how the anisotropic bond strength affects the phase diagram and strength of quantum fluctuations. We found various large unit cell phases due to the competing frustrations, and analyzed their intrinsic degeneracy based on the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Using the linear spin wave theory we showed that the anisotropic bond strength enhances quantum fluctuations in the $\Gamma$-dominant regime where a small reduced moment is observed. The implications of our findings in relation to the quantum model are also discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Assessing the detectability of the secondary spin in extreme mass-ratio inspirals with fully-relativistic numerical waveforms,"Extreme mass-ratio inspirals~(EMRIs) detectable by the Laser Inteferometric Space Antenna~(LISA) are unique probes of astrophysics and fundamental physics. Parameter estimation for these sources is challenging, especially because the waveforms are long, complicated, known only numerically, and slow to compute in the most relevant regime, where the dynamics is relativistic. We perform a time-consuming Fisher-matrix error analysis of the EMRI parameters using fully-relativistic numerical waveforms to leading order in an adiabatic expansion on a Kerr background, taking into account the motion of the LISA constellation, higher harmonics, and also including the leading correction from the spin of the secondary in the post-adiabatic approximation. We pay particular attention to the convergence of the numerical derivatives in the Fisher matrix and to the numerical stability of the covariance matrix, which for some systems requires computing the numerical waveforms with approximately $90$-digit precision. Our analysis confirms previous results (obtained with approximated but much more computationally efficient waveforms) for the measurement errors on the binary's parameters. We also show that the inclusion of higher harmonics improves the errors on the luminosity distance and on the orbital angular momentum angles by one order and two orders of magnitude, respectively, which might be useful to identify the environments where EMRIs live. We particularly focus on the measurability of the spin of the secondary, confirming that it cannot be measured with sufficient accuracy. However, due to correlations, its inclusion in the waveform model can deteriorate the accuracy on the measurements of other parameters by orders of magnitude, unless a physically-motivated prior on the secondary spin is imposed.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Gamma-ray Polarimetry of Transient Sources with POLAR,"Polarization measurements of the gamma-ray component of transient sources are of great scientific interest, they are however, also highly challenging. This is due to the typical low signal to noise and the potential for significant systematic errors. Both issues are made worse by the transient nature of the events which prompt one to observe a large portion of the sky. The POLAR instrument was designed as a dedicated transient gamma-ray polarimeter. It made use of a large effective area and large field of view to maximize the signal to noise as well as the number of observed transients. Additionally, it was calibrated carefully on ground and in orbit to mitigate systematic errors. The main scientific goal of POLAR was to measure the polarization of the prompt emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts. During the 6 months operation in orbit POLAR observed 55 Gamma-Ray Bursts of which 14 were bright enough to allow for constraining polarization measurements. In this chapter we mainly discuss about the POLAR instrument along with the calibration and analysis procedures. Two analyses are described, the first is a straightforward method previously implemented in polarization measurements, whilst the second was developed to improve the sensitivity and to mitigate several of the issues with the former. Both methods are described in detail along with information on how these can be extended to perform time and energy resolved polarization measurements.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Dynamical system analysis of dark energy models in scalar coupled metric-torsion theories,"We study the phase space dynamics of cosmological models in the theoretical formulations of non-minimal metric-torsion couplings with a scalar field, and investigate in particular the critical points which yield stable solutions exhibiting cosmic acceleration driven by the {\em dark energy}. The latter is defined in a way that it effectively has no direct interaction with the cosmological fluid, although in an equivalent scalar-tensor cosmological setup the scalar field interacts with the fluid (which we consider to be the pressureless dust). Determining the conditions for the existence of the stable critical points we check their physical viability, in both Einstein and Jordan frames. We also verify that in either of these frames, the evolution of the universe at the corresponding stable points matches with that given by the respective exact solutions we have found in an earlier work (arXiv: 1611.00654 [gr-qc]). We not only examine the regions of physical relevance for the trajectories in the phase space when the coupling parameter is varied, but also demonstrate the evolution profiles of the cosmological parameters of interest along fiducial trajectories in the effectively non-interacting scenarios, in both Einstein and Jordan frames.",hep,hep-th,On Tachyon kinks from the DBI action,"We consider solitonic solutions of the DBI tachyon effective action for a non-BPS brane in the presence of an electric field.

On the other hand for the critical electric field $\tilde E=1$, regular and finite energy solitons are constructed without any restriction on the potential.",hep,hep-th,1
"The $m$-$z$ relation for type Ia supernovae, locally inhomogeneous cosmological models, and the nature of dark matter","The $m$-$z$ relation for type Ia supernovae is one of the key pieces of evidence supporting the cosmological `concordance model' with $\lambda_0 \approx 0.7$ and $\Omega_0 \approx 0.3$. However, it is well known that the $m$-$z$ relation depends not only on $\lambda_0$ and $\Omega_0$ (with $H_0$ as a scale factor) but also on the density of matter along the line of sight, which is not necessarily the same as the large-scale density. I investigate to what extent the measurement of $\lambda_0$ and $\Omega_0$ depends on this density when it is characterized by the parameter $\eta$ ($0 \le \eta \le 1$), which describes the ratio of density along the line of sight to the overall density. I also discuss what constraints can be placed on $\eta$, both with and without constraints on $\lambda_0$ and $\Omega_0$ in addition to those from the $m$-$z$ relation for type~Ia supernovae.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Constraining the anisotropy of the Universe with the X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars,"We test the anisotropy in the Finslerian cosmological model with the X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) fluxes of 808 quasars. The dipole amplitude is $A_D=0.302_{ -0.124}^{ +0.185}$ and the dipole direction points towards $(l, b) = ( 288.92_{~ -28.80^{\circ}}^{^{\circ}+23.74^{\circ}}, 6.10_{~ -16.40^{\circ}}^{^{\circ} +16.55^{\circ}} )$. We find that the dipole direction from the X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars is very close to the dipole direction given by the ""Joint Light-curve Analysis"" (JLA) compilation in the Finslerian cosmological model and the angular difference between the two dipole directions is only $10.44^{\circ}$. We also find the angular difference between the dipole direction from the 808 quasars in the Finslerian cosmological model and ones from the supernovae of type Ia (SNe Ia) samples in the dipole-modulated $\Lambda$CDM model is around $30^{\circ}$. Six gravitationally lensed quasars are considered to investigate the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the Finslerian cosmological model. We get a slightly smaller $H_0$ than the result given by the six gravitationally lensed quasars. Finally, we forecast the future constraints on the dipole parameters with the X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars. As the number of simulations increases, the precisions of the parameters related to anisotropy in the Finslerian cosmological model improve significantly. The X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars have a promising future as a probe of anisotropy in Finsler spacetime.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Single or Double Degenerate Progenitors? Searching for Shock Emission in the SDSS-II Type Ia Supernovae,"From the set of nearly 500 spectroscopically confirmed type~Ia supernovae and around 10,000 unconfirmed candidates from SDSS-II, we select a subset of 108 confirmed SNe Ia with well-observed early-time light curves to search for signatures from shock interaction of the supernova with a companion star. No evidence for shock emission is seen; however, the cadence and photometric noise could hide a weak shock signal. We simulate shocked light curves using SN Ia templates and a simple, Gaussian shock model to emulate the noise properties of the SDSS-II sample and estimate the detectability of the shock interaction signal as a function of shock amplitude, shock width, and shock fraction. We find no direct evidence for shock interaction in the rest-frame $B$-band, but place an upper limit on the shock amplitude at 9% of supernova peak flux ($M_B > -16.6$ mag). If the single degenerate channel dominates type~Ia progenitors, this result constrains the companion stars to be less than about 6 $M_{\odot}$ on the main sequence, and strongly disfavors red giant companions.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,ICE-COLA: Towards fast and accurate synthetic galaxy catalogues optimizing a quasi $N$-body method,"Next generation galaxy surveys demand the development of massive ensembles of galaxy mocks to model the observables and their covariances, what is computationally prohibitive using $N$-body simulations. COLA is a novel method designed to make this feasible by following an approximate dynamics but with up to 3 orders of magnitude speed-ups when compared to an exact $N$-body. In this paper we investigate the optimization of the code parameters in the compromise between computational cost and recovered accuracy in observables such as two-point clustering and halo abundance. We benchmark those observables with a state-of-the-art $N$-body run, the MICE Grand Challenge simulation (MICE-GC). We find that using 40 time steps linearly spaced since $z_i \sim 20$, and a force mesh resolution three times finer than that of the number of particles, yields a matter power spectrum within $1\%$ for $k \lesssim 1\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and a halo mass function within $5\%$ of those in the $N$-body. In turn the halo bias is accurate within $2\%$ for $k \lesssim 0.7\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ whereas, in redshift space, the halo monopole and quadrupole are within $4\%$ for $k \lesssim 0.4\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. These results hold for a broad range in redshift ($0 < z < 1$) and for all halo mass bins investigated ($M > 10^{12.5} \, h^{-1} \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$). To bring accuracy in clustering to one percent level we study various methods that re-calibrate halo masses and/or velocities. We thus propose an optimized choice of COLA code parameters as a powerful tool to optimally exploit future galaxy surveys.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Negative-mass exciton polaritons induced by dissipative light-matter coupling in an atomically thin semiconductor,"Dispersion engineering is a powerful and versatile tool that can vary the speed of light signals and induce negative-mass effects in the dynamics of particles and quasiparticles. Here, we show that dissipative coupling between bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and photons in an optical microcavity can lead to the formation of exciton polaritons with an inverted dispersion of the lower polariton branch and hence a negative mass. We perform direct measurements of the anomalous dispersion in atomically thin (monolayer) WS$_2$ crystals embedded in planar microcavities and demonstrate that the propagation direction of the negative-mass polaritons is opposite to their momentum. Our study introduces a new concept of non-Hermitian dispersion engineering for exciton polaritons and opens a pathway for realising new phases of quantum matter in a solid state.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Resonantly induced friction in driven nanomechanical systems,"We propose a new mechanism of friction in resonantly driven vibrational systems.

Galaxy-CMB and galaxy-galaxy lensing on large scales: sensitivity to primordial non-Gaussianity,"A convincing detection of primordial non-Gaussianity in the local form of the bispectrum, whose amplitude is given by the fNL parameter, offers a powerful test of inflation. In this paper we calculate the modification of two-point cross-correlation statistics of weak lensing - galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) cross-correlation - due to fNL. We derive and calculate the covariance matrix of galaxy-galaxy lensing including cosmic variance terms. We focus on large scales (l<100) for which the shape noise of the shear measurement becomes irrelevant and cosmic variance dominates the error budget. For a modest degree of non-Gaussianity, fNL=+/-50, modifications of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal at the 10% level are seen on scales R~300 Mpc, and grow rapidly toward larger scales as \propto R^2. We also see a clear signature of the baryonic acoustic oscillation feature in the matter power spectrum at ~150 Mpc, which can be measured by next-generation lensing experiments. In addition we can probe the local-form primordial non-Gaussianity in the galaxy-CMB lensing signal by correlating the lensing potential reconstructed from CMB with high-z galaxies. For example, for fNL=+/-50, we find that the galaxy-CMB lensing cross power spectrum is modified by ~10% at l~40, and by a factor of two at l~10, for a population of galaxies at z=2 with a bias of 2. The effect is greater for more highly biased populations at larger z; thus, high-z galaxy surveys cross-correlated with CMB offer a yet another probe of primordial non-Gaussianity.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,C II radiative cooling of the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium: Insight about the star formation in Damped Lyman-alpha systems,"The far-infrared [C II] 158 micrometer fine structure transition is considered to be a dominant coolant in the interstellar medium. For this reason, under the assumption of a thermal steady state, it may be used to infer the heating rate and, in turn, the star formation rate in local, as well as in high redshift systems. In this work, radio and ultraviolet observations of the Galactic interstellar medium are used to understand whether C II is indeed a good tracer of the star formation rate. For a sample of high Galactic latitude sightlines, direct measurements of the temperature indicate the presence of C II in both the cold and the warm phases of the diffuse interstellar gas. The cold gas fraction (~ 10 - 50% of the total neutral gas column density) is not negligible even at high Galactic latitude. It is shown that, to correctly estimate the star formation rate, C II cooling in both the phases should hence be considered. The simple assumption, that the [C II] line originates only from either the cold or the warm phase, significantly underpredicts or overpredicts the star formation rate, respectively. These results are particularly important in the context of the Damped Lyman-alpha systems for which a similar method is often used to estimate the star formation rate. The derived star formation rates in such cases may not be reliable if the temperature of the gas under consideration is not constrained independently.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Automating Analysis of Neutron Scattering Time-of-Flight Single Crystal Phonon Data,"This article introduces software called Phonon Explorer that implements a data mining workflow for large datasets of the neutron scattering function, S(Q, {\omega}), measured on time-of-flight neutron spectrometers.

Constraints on jet formation mechanisms with the most energetic giant outbursts in MS 0735+7421,"Giant X-ray cavities lie in some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) locating in central galaxies of clusters, most of these cavities are thought to be inflated by jets of AGNs. The jets can be either powered by rotating black holes or the accretion disks surrounding black holes, or both. In this work, we choose the most energetic cavity, MS 0735+7421, with stored energy ~ 10^62 erg, to constrain the jet formation mechanisms and the evolution of the central massive black hole in this source. The bolometric luminosity of the AGN in this cavity is ~ 10^(-5) L_Edd, however, the mean power of the jet required to inflate the cavity is estimated as ~ 0.02 L_Edd, which implies that the source has experienced strong outbursts previously. During outbursts, the jet power and the mass accretion rate should be significantly higher than its present values. We construct an accretion disk model, in which the angular momentum and energy carried away by jets is properly included, to calculate the spin and mass evolution of the massive black hole. In our calculations, different jet formation mechanisms are employed, and we find that the jets generated with the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism are unable to produce the giant cavity with ~ 10^62 erg in this source. Only the jets accelerated with the combination of the Blandford-Payne (BP) and BZ mechanisms can successfully inflate such a giant cavity, if the magnetic pressure is close to equipartition with the total (radiation+gas) pressure of the accretion disk. For dynamo generated magnetic field in the disk, such an energetic giant cavity can be inflated by the magnetically driven jets only if the initial black hole spin parameter a_0 > 0.95. Our calculations show that the final spin parameter a of the black hole is always ~ 0:9 - 0.998 for all the computational examples which can provide sufficient energy for the cavity of MS 0735+7421.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,The Accretion of Gas onto Galaxies as Traced by their Satellites,"We have compiled a large sample of isolated central galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which do not have a neighbour of comparable brightness within a projected distance of 1 Mpc. We use the colours, luminosities and surface brightnesses of satellite galaxies in the vicinity of these objects to estimate their atomic gas content and to derive the average total mass of HI gas contained in satellites as a function of projected radius from the primary. Recent calibrations of merging timescales from N-body simulations are used to estimate the rate at which this gas will accrete onto the primaries. Our estimated accretion rates fall short of those needed to maintain the observed level of star formation in these systems by nearly two orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, there are strong correlations between the total mass of gas in satellites and the colours and specific star formation rates of central galaxies of all stellar masses. The correlations are much weaker if we consider the total stellar mass in the satellites, rather than their total gas mass. We ask why star formation in the central galaxies should be correlated with gas contained in satellites at projected separations of a Mpc or more, well outside the virial radius of the dark matter halos of these systems. We suggest that gas-rich satellites trace an underlying reservoir of ionized gas that is accreted continuously, and that provides the fuel for ongoing star formation in galaxies in the local Universe.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
"Second-order, number-conserving description of non-equilibrium dynamics in finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensates","While the Gross--Pitaevskii equation is well-established as the canonical dynamical description of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at zero-temperature, describing the dynamics of BECs at finite temperatures remains a difficult theoretical problem, particularly when considering low-temperature, non-equilibrium systems in which depletion of the condensate occurs dynamically as a result of external driving. In this paper, we describe a fully time-dependent numerical implementation of a second-order, number-conserving description of finite-temperature BEC dynamics. This description consists of equations of motion describing the coupled dynamics of the condensate and non-condensate fractions in a self-consistent manner, and is ideally suited for the study of low-temperature, non-equilibrium, driven systems. The \delta-kicked-rotor BEC provides a prototypical example of such a system, and we demonstrate the efficacy of our numerical implementation by investigating its dynamics at finite temperature. We demonstrate that the qualitative features of the system dynamics at zero temperature are generally preserved at finite temperatures, and predict a quantitative finite-temperature shift of resonance frequencies which would be relevant for, and could be verified by, future experiments.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Reduced density matrix approach to ultracold few-fermion systems in one dimension,"The variational determination of the two-fermion reduced density matrix is described for harmonically trapped, ultracold few-fermion systems in one dimension with equal spin populations. This is accomplished by formulating the problem as a semi-definite program, with the two-fermion reduced density matrix being subject to well-known $N$-representability conditions. The ground-state energies, as well as the density, pair-correlation function, and lower-order eigenvalues of the two-fermion reduced density matrix of various fermionic systems are found by utilising an augmented Lagrangian method for semi-definite programming. The ground-state energies are found to match well to those determined by full-configuration interaction and coupled-cluster calculations and the density, pair-correlation function, and eigenvalue results demonstrate that the salient features of these systems are well-described by this method. These results collectively demonstrate the utility of the reduced density matrix method firstly in describing strong correlation arising from short-range interactions, suggesting that the well-known N-representability conditions are sufficient to model ultracold fermionic systems, and secondly in illustrating the prospect of treating larger systems currently out of the reach of established methods.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,1
Thermodynamic instability of doubly spinning black objects,We investigate the thermodynamic stability of neutral black objects with (at least) two angular momenta. We use the quasilocal formalism to compute the grand canonical potential and show that the doubly spinning black ring is thermodynamically unstable.

We calculate the quantum corrected scale factor, energy density, and entropy production at late times, taking different cut-off functions. Our approach differs from previous ones in the way energy-momentum conservation is imposed -- we include the running Newton constant $G(k)$ in the definition of energy-momentum tensor, keeping in mind the covariant conservation identity of the Einstein tensor. The quantum corrections obtained in this approach are different from what are found by letting the conservation equation remain the same as for a scale-independent Newton constant. We also find that for a specific choice of the cut-off scale, the quantum corrected behaviour of the Newton constant and the cosmological constant lead to a bouncing emergent universe solution.",hep,hep-th,1
Approximate Ginsparg-Wilson Fermions for QCD,"Lattice fermions obeying the Ginsparg-Wilson relation do correctly represent the physical properties related to chirality. This can be achieved by local fermions, which involve an infinite number of couplings, however. For practical purposes, it is useful to first construct approximate Ginsparg-Wilson fermions within a short range. We report on a successful construction in QCD at \beta =6. The good quality of the approximation is observed from the spectrum, which is situated close to a Ginsparg-Wilson circle. These fermions also provide an excellent approximation to rotational symmetry and they are promising for a good scaling, since they arise from the perfect action framework. Their insertion into the overlap formula renders the Ginsparg-Wilson relation exact. It leads to an improved overlap fermion with a high level of locality. This insertion is statistically on safe grounds at about \beta > 5.6.",hep,hep-lat,Quark-gluon plasma phenomenology from anisotropic lattice QCD,"The FASTSUM collaboration has been carrying out simulations of N_f=2+1 QCD at nonzero temperature in the fixed-scale approach using anisotropic lattices.

Low-energy three-body dynamics in binary quantum gases,"The universal three-body dynamics in ultra-cold binary Fermi and Fermi-Bose mixtures is studied. Two identical fermions of the mass $m$ and a particle of the mass $m_1$ with the zero-range two-body interaction in the states of the total angular momentum L=1 are considered. Using the boundary condition model for the s-wave interaction of different particles, both eigenvalue and scattering problems are treated by solving hyper-radial equations, whose terms are derived analytically. The dependencies of the three-body binding energies on the mass ratio $m/m_1$ for the positive two-body scattering length are calculated; it is shown that the ground and excited states arise at $m/m_1 \ge \lambda_1 \approx 8.17260$ and $m/m_1 \ge \lambda_2 \approx 12.91743$, respectively. For $m/m_1 \alt \lambda_1$ and $m/m_1 \alt \lambda_2$, the relevant bound states turn to narrow resonances, whose positions and widths are calculated. The 2 + 1 elastic scattering and the three-body recombination near the three-body threshold are studied and it is shown that a two-hump structure in the mass-ratio dependencies of the cross sections is connected with arising of the bound states.",physics,physics.atom-ph,Few interacting fermions in one-dimensional harmonic trap,"We study spin-1/2 fermions, interacting via a two-body contact potential, in a one-dimensional harmonic trap.

Constraints on scalar coupling to electromagnetism,"We review a possible non-minimal coupling (dilatonic) of a scalar field (axion like particle) to electromagnetism, through experimental and observational constraints. Such a coupling is motivated from recent quasar spectrum observations that indicate a possible spatial and/or temporal variation of the fine-structure constant. We consider a dilatonic coupling of the form $B_F (\phi) = 1 + g\phi$. The strongest bound on the coupling parameter $g$ is derived from weak equivalence principle tests, which impose $g < 1.6 \times 10^{-17}GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is strong enough to rule out this class of models as a cause for an observable cosmological variation of the fine structure constant unless a chameleon mechanism is implemented. Also, we argue that a similar coupling occurs in chameleon cosmology, another candidate dark mater particle and we estimate the cosmological consequences by both effects. It should be clarified that this class of models is not necessarily ruled out in the presence of a chameleon mechanism which can freeze the dynamics of the scalar field in high density laboratory regions.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,The Interplay of Kinetic and Radiative Feedback in Galaxy Clusters,"Recent observations provide evidence that some cool-core clusters (CCCs) host quasars in their brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Motivated by these findings we use 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with the code Enzo to explore the joint role of the kinetic and radiative feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in BCGs. We implement kinetic feedback as sub-relativistic plasma outflows and model radiative feedback using the ray-tracing radiative transfer or thermal energy injection. In our simulations the central SMBH transitions between the radiatively efficient and radiatively inefficient states on timescales of a few Gyr, as a function of its accretion rate. The timescale for this transition depends primarily on the fraction of power allocated to each feedback mode, and to a lesser degree on the overall feedback luminosity of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Specifically, we find that (a) kinetic feedback must be present at both low and high accretion rates in order to prevent the cooling catastrophe, and (b) its contribution likely accounts for > 10% of the total AGN feedback power, since below this threshold simulated BCGs tend to host radio-loud quasars most of the time, in apparent contrast with observations. We also find a positive correlation between the AGN feedback power and the mass of the cold gas filaments in the cluster core, indicating that observations of H$\alpha$ filaments can be used as a measure of AGN feedback.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Spin dynamics in the Kapitza-Dirac effect,"Electron spin dynamics in Kapitza-Dirac scattering from a standing laser wave of high frequency and high intensity is studied.

Distinct spin dynamics, with Rabi oscillations and complete spin-flip transitions, is demonstrated for Kapitza-Dirac scattering involving three photons in a parameter regime accessible to future high-power X-ray laser sources.

Quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT) is a promising basis for the analysis of nonlinear optical responses involving such quantum mechanical effects.

Strong Cosmic Censorship in Charged de Sitter spacetime with Scalar Field Non-minimally Coupled to Curvature,"We examine the stability and the strong cosmic censorship in the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter (RN-dS) black hole by investigating the evolution of a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the curvature. We find that when the coupling parameter is negative, the RN-dS black hole experiences instability. The instability disappears when the coupling parameter becomes non-negative. With the increase of the coupling parameter, the violation of the strong cosmic censorship occurs at a larger critical charge ratio. But such an increase of the critical charge is suppressed by the increase of the cosmological constant. Different from the minimal coupling situation, it is possible to accommodate $\beta\ge1$ in the near extremal black hole when the scalar field is non-minimally coupled to curvature. The increase of the cosmological constant can allow $\beta\ge1$ to be satisfied for even smaller value of the coupling parameter. The existence of $\beta\ge1$ implies that the resulting curvature can continuously cross the Cauchy horizon.",hep,hep-th,Hawking radiation in the kappa-spacetime,"In this paper, we analyze the Hawking radiation of a kappa-deformed Schwarzchild black hole and obtain the deformed Hawking temperature. For this, we first derive deformed metric for the kappa-spacetime, which in the generic case, is not a symmetric tensor and also has a momentum dependence. We show that the Schwarzchild metric obtained in the kappa-deformed spacetime has a dependence on energy. We use the fact that the deformed metric is conformally flat in the 1+1 dimensions, to solve the kappa-deformed Klein-Gordon equation in the background of the Schwarzchild metric. The method of Boguliobov coefficients is then used to calculate the thermal spectrum of kappa-deformed-Schwarzchild black hole and show that the Hawking temperature is modified by the non-commutativity of the kappa-spacetime.",hep,hep-th,1
Some remarks on a paper by G.-S. Yang and H.-C.Kim: Mass splitting of SU(3) baryons within a chiral soliton model,"In a recent paper Yang and Kim discuss the lowest baryon mass formulas using a chiral soliton model. However, contrary to their assertion, their result is not equivalent to a generalized Gell Mann-Okubo mass formula derived (G.Morpurgo 1992) using only general properties of QCD (The General parameterization method). The reason for the non equivalence is that the generalized mass formula include all the main terms that break flavor at second order, whereas the Authors above do not go beyond first order flavor breaking (and should therefore find the usual Gell Mann Okubo formula). That is is not so, due to some inconsistencies. Below we confine to the part of the Yang-Kim paper dealing with the mass formula. We will not consider the other items of their paper.",hep,hep-ph,Probing Proton Structure at the Large Hadron electron Collider,"For the foreseeable future, the exploration of the high-energy frontier will be the domain of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Of particular significance will be its high-luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC), which will operate until the mid-2030s. In this endeavour, for the full exploitation of the HL-LHC physics potential an improved understanding of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton is critical. The HL-LHC program would be uniquely complemented by the proposed Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC), a high-energy lepton-proton and lepton-nucleus collider based at CERN. In this work, we build on our recent PDF projections for the HL-LHC to assess the constraining power of the LHeC measurements of inclusive and heavy quark structure functions. We find that the impact of the LHeC would be significant, reducing PDF uncertainties by up to an order of magnitude in comparison to state-of-the-art global fits. In comparison to the HL-LHC projections, the PDF constraints from the LHeC are in general more significant for small and intermediate values of the momentum fraction x. At higher values of x, the impact of the LHeC and HL-LHC data is expected to be of a comparable size, with the HL-LHC constraints being more competitive in some cases, and the LHeC ones in others. Our results illustrate the encouraging complementarity of the HL-LHC and the LHeC in terms of charting the quark and gluon structure of the proton.",hep,hep-ph,1
Majorana Neutrino Masses and Neutrino Oscillations,"We examine some patterns of Majorana neutrino mass matrix which is compatible with the phenomenological lepton flavor mixing matrix and non-observation of neutrinoless double beta decay. Imposing $(M_{\nu})_{ee}=0$ for the Majorana neutrino mass matrix in the leading order, we obtain a relationship between the solar mixing angle and the neutrino masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. Additional possible texture zeros are assigned to the mass matrix so as for the nonvanishing $\theta_{13}$ to be predictable in terms of neutrino masses. We also show how three neutrino masses can be predicted from the solar mixing angle and the experimental results of $\Delta m^2_{sol}$ and $\Delta m^2_{atm}$ in this framework, and we discuss naturality of the forms of the mass matrix found in our work.",hep,hep-ph,Radiative Corrections to Deep Inelastic Scattering in the Presence of an Additional Z' at LEP x LHC,"The study of ep-scattering at LEP x LHC offers an interesting opportunity to search for additional heavy neutral gauge bosons. We study the influence of radiative corrections, especially of the potentially large QED contributions, to the expected cross sections. These corrections are typically of the same order as the effect searched for or even larger and have to be taken into account properly.",hep,hep-ph,1
Large inverse tunneling magnetoresistance in Co$_2$Cr$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$Al/MgO/CoFe magnetic tunnel junctions,Magnetic tunnel junctions with the layer sequence Co$_2$Cr$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$Al/MgO/CoFe were fabricated by magnetron sputtering at room temperature (RT). The samples exhibit a large inverse tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect of up to -66% at RT. The largest value of -84% at 20 K reflects a rather weak influence of temperature. The dependence on the voltage drop shows an unusual behavior with two almost symmetric peaks at $\pm600$ mV with large inverse TMR ratios and small positive values around zero bias.,cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,c-Axis Intra-Layer Couplings in the CuO_2 Planes of High-T_c Cuprates,We discuss the static deformations of the doped CuO_2 lattices in YBa_2Cu_3O_x. Intrinsic lattice effects driven by the strong correlations of the electron system are separated from extrinsic chemical and bandstructure effects. c-axis displacements of the planar copper atoms seem to be a generic property of the metallic CuO_2 lattices.,cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Renormalization of Non-Semisimple Gauge Models with the Background Field Method,"We study the renormalization of non-semisimple gauge models quantized in the `t Hooft-background gauge to all orders. We analyze the normalization conditions for masses and couplings compatible with the Slavnov-Taylor and Ward-Takahashi Identities and with the IR constraints. We take into account both the problem of renormalization of CKM matrix elements and the problem of CP violation and we show that the Background Field Method (BFM) provides proper normalization conditions for fermion, scalar and gauge field mixings. We discuss the hard and the soft anomalies of the Slavnov-Taylor Identities and the conditions under which they are absent.",hep,hep-th,Non-perturbative method for particle detectors with continuous interactions,"We show that detector switching profiles consisting of trains of delta couplings are a useful computational tool to efficiently approximate results involving continuous switching functions, both in setups involving a single detector and multiple ones. The rapid convergence to the continuous results at all orders in perturbation theory for sufficiently regular switchings means that this tool can be used to obtain non-perturbative results for general particle detector phenomena with continuous switching functions.",hep,hep-th,1
"FA2PbBr4: synthesis, structure and unusual optical properties of two polymorphs of formamidinium-based layered (110) hybrid perovskite","Small cations such as guanidinium and cesium can act as templating cations to form low dimensional phases (2D, 1D, 0D) in the case of excess of organic halides. However, such phases with the widely used formamidinium (FA+) cation have not been reported so far. In this study, we discovered two novel low dimensional phases with a composition of FA2PbBr4 and investigated the prerequisites of their formation upon crystallization of FABr-excessive solutions of FAPbBr3. We found that both phases have the structure of (110) layered perovskite but are represented by two different polymorphs with eclipsed and staggered arrangement of adjacent layers. It was shown that FA2PbBr4 phases usually exist in a labile equilibrium with FAPbBr3 3D perovskite and can form composites with it. The optical properties of both polymorphs were comprehensively studied by means of absorption spectroscopy, diffuse reflection spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. DFT calculations were applied to investigate the band structure of the FA2PbBr4 and to corroborate the conclusions on their optoelectronic properties. As a result, we found that FA2PbBr4 phases irradiated by UV can exhibit effective green photoluminescence due to a transfer of excitation energy to defective states or 3D perovskite inclusions.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Optimal finite-range atomic basis sets for liquid water and ice,"Finite-range numerical atomic orbitals are the basis functions of choice for several first principles methods, due to their flexibility and scalability. Generating and testing such basis sets, however, remains a significant challenge for the end user. We discuss these issues and present a new scheme for generating improved polarization orbitals of finite range. We then develop a series of high-accuracy basis sets for the water molecule, and report on their performance in describing the monomer and dimer, two phases of ice, and liquid water at ambient and high density. The tests are performed by comparison with plane-wave calculations, and show the atomic orbital basis sets to exhibit an excellent level of transferability and consistency. The highest-order bases (quadruple-zeta) are shown to give accuracies comparable to a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of at least ~1000 eV for quantities such as energy differences and ionic forces, as well as achieving significantly greater accuracies for total energies and absolute pressures.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Inclusive and exclusive decays of doubly heavy baryons,In this paper we give a short review of the recently obtained results on inclusive and exclusive decays of doubly heavy baryons.,hep,hep-ph,Top quark polarization as a probe of $t\bar{t}$ threshold dynamics,"We study the spin properties of top quarks produced in collisions of polarized photons in the threshold region. For a relatively heavy top quark the influence of non-perturbative effects is small and its polarization parameters can be predicted in perturbative QCD. The measurements of the top polarization may allow a novel test of QCD in the $t\bar{t}$ system. In particular, they may provide a new way to determine the precise value of $\alpha_s$ and to study the properties of the top quark.",hep,hep-ph,1
Next-to-Leading Order QCD Corrections to Inclusive Heavy-Flavor Production in Polarized Deep-Inelastic Scattering,"We provide a first calculation of the complete next-to-leading order QCD corrections for heavy flavor contributions to the inclusive structure function $g_1$ in longitudinally polarized deep-inelastic scattering. The results are derived with largely analytical methods and retain the full dependence on the heavy quark's mass. We discuss all relevant technical details of the calculation and present numerical results for the heavy quark scaling functions. We perform important crosschecks to verify our results in the known limit of photoproduction and for the unpolarized electroproduction of heavy quarks. We also compare our calculations to the available, partial results in the polarized case, in particular, in the limit of asymptotically large photon virtualities, and analyze the behavior of the scaling functions near threshold. First steps towards phenomenological applications are taken by providing some estimates for inclusive charm production in polarized deep-inelastic scattering at a future electron-ion collider and studying their sensitivity to the polarized gluon distribution. The residual dependence of heavy quark electroproduction on unphysical factorization and renormalization scales and on the heavy quark mass is investigated.",hep,hep-ph,Spin Physics with Top Quarks at Hadron Colliders,We discuss the prospects to observe effects of transverse polarization and spin-spin correlations of top quark pairs produced at hadron colliders.,hep,hep-ph,1
Dynamic Rashba-Dresselhaus Effect,"The Rashba-Dresselhaus effect is the splitting of doubly degenerate band extrema in semiconductors, accompanied by the emergence of counter-rotating spin textures and spin-momentum locking. Here we investigate how this effect is modified by lattice vibrations. We show that, in centrosymmetric non-magnetic crystals, for which a bulk Rashba-Dresselhaus effect is symmetry-forbidden, electron-phonon interactions can induce a phonon-assisted, dynamic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting in the presence of an out-of-equilibrium phonon population. In particular, we show how Rashba, Dresselhaus, or Weyl spin textures can selectively be established by driving coherent infrared-active phonons, and we perform ab initio calculations to quantify this effect for halide perovskites.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Parity Effects in Stacked Nanoscopic Quantum Rings,"The ground state and the dielectric response of stacked quantum rings are investigated in the presence of an applied magnetic field along the ring axis. For odd number $N$ of rings and an electric field perpendicular to the axis, a linear Stark effect occurs at distinct values of the magnetic field. At those fields energy levels cross in the absence of electric field. For even values of $N$ a quadratic Stark effect is expected in all cases, but the induced electric polarization is discontinuous at those special magnetic fields. Experimental consequences for related nanostructures are discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Radio observations of extreme ULXs: revealing the most powerful ULX radio nebula ever or the jet of an intermediate-mass black hole?,"The most extreme ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), with $L_\mathrm{X} > 5 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, are amongst the best candidates for hosting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in the haloes of galaxies. Jet radio emission is expected from a sub-Eddington accreting IMBH in the low/hard (radio bright) state. In a search for such IMBH jet radio emission, we have observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 5 GHz a sample of seven extreme ULXs whose X-ray properties indicate they are in the hard state. Assuming they remain in this state, the non-detection of radio emission for six of the target sources allows us to constrain their black hole mass to the IMBH regime, thus ruling out a supermassive black hole nature. For the extreme ULX in the galaxy NGC\,2276, we detect extended radio emission formed by two lobes of total flux density 1.43 $\pm$ 0.22 mJy and size $\sim$650 pc. The X-ray counterpart is located between the two lobes, suggesting the presence of a black hole with jet radio emission. The radio luminosity allows us to constrain the black hole mass of this source to the IMBH regime; hence, the extreme ULX in NGC\,2276 could be the first detection of extended jet radio emission from an IMBH. The radio emission could also possibly come from a radio nebula powered by the ULX with a minimum total energy of $5.9 \times 10^{52}$ erg, thus constituting the most powerful and largest ULX radio nebula ever observed.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,MOND and IMF variations in early-type galaxies from $ATLAS^{3D}$,"MOdified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) represents a phenomenological alternative to dark matter (DM) for the missing mass problem in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. We analyze the central regions of a local sample of $\sim 220$ early-type galaxies from the $\rm ATLAS^{3D}$ survey, to see if the data can be reproduced without recourse to DM. We estimate dynamical masses in the MOND context through Jeans analysis, and compare to $\rm ATLAS^{3D}$ stellar masses from stellar population synthesis. We find that the observed stellar mass--velocity dispersion relation is steeper than expected assuming MOND with a fixed stellar initial mass function (IMF) and a standard value for the acceleration parameter $a_{\rm 0}$. Turning from the space of observables to model space, a) fixing the IMF, a universal value for $a_{\rm 0}$ cannot be fitted, while, b) fixing $a_{\rm 0}$ and leaving the IMF free to vary, we find that it is ""lighter"" (Chabrier-like) for low-dispersion galaxies, and ""heavier"" (Salpeter-like) for high dispersions. This MOND-based trend matches inferences from Newtonian dynamics with DM, and from detailed analysis of spectral absorption lines, adding to the converging lines of evidence for a systematically-varying IMF.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Massless scalar field in de Sitter spacetime: unitary quantum time evolution,"We prove that, under the standard conformal scaling, a massless field in de Sitter spacetime admits an O(4)-invariant Fock quantization such that time evolution is unitarily implemented. This result disproves previous claims in the literature. We discuss the relationship between this quantization with unitary dynamics and the family of O(4)-invariant Hadamard states given by Allen and Folacci, as well as with the Bunch-Davies vacuum.",hep,hep-th,Holographic Cosmology $n$-point function map from the Wavefunction of the Universe,"In this note we show explicitly that, applying an extension of Maldacena's map for the wavefunction of the Universe $Z[\phi]=\Psi[\phi]$ from de Sitter inflation to holographic cosmology, we find the relations previously derived for 2-point functions, $\langle h_{ij}(p) h_{kl}(-p)\rangle \sim 1/[{\rm Im}\langle T_{ij}(-ip)T_{kl}(+ip)\rangle]$ and a similar one for currents, which were used to show that holographic cosmology matches CMBR data and solves Big Bang problems as well as inflation. Higher point functions are done similarly, and as an application, we check the result for the 3-point functions of scalar and tensor fluctuations and find the result for the monopole non-Gaussianity arising from the 3-point functions of currents. The method is simple and potentially could be applied to calculate any observable in holographic cosmology.",hep,hep-th,1
The refractive index and wave vector in passive or active media,"Materials that exhibit loss or gain have a complex valued refractive index $n$. Nevertheless, when considering the propagation of optical pulses, using a complex $n$ is generally inconvenient -- hence the standard choice of real-valued refractive index, i.e. $n_s = \RealPart (\sqrt{n^2})$. However, an analysis of pulse propagation based on the second order wave equation shows that use of $n_s$ results in a wave vector \emph{different} to that actually exhibited by the propagating pulse. In contrast, an alternative definition $n_c = \sqrt{\RealPart (n^2)}$, always correctly provides the wave vector of the pulse. Although for small loss the difference between the two is negligible, in other cases it is significant; it follows that phase and group velocities are also altered. This result has implications for the description of pulse propagation in near resonant situations, such as those typical of metamaterials with negative (or otherwise exotic) refractive indices.",physics,physics.optics,Toroidal dipole excitations in metamolecules formed by interacting plasmonic nanorods,"We show how the elusive toroidal dipole moment appears as a radiative excitation eigenmode in a metamolecule resonator that is formed by pairs of plasmonic nanorods. We analyze one such nanorod configuration - a toroidal metamolecule. We find that the radiative interactions in the toroidal metamolecule can be qualitatively represented by a theoretical model based on an electric point dipole arrangement. Both a finite-size rod model and the point dipole approximation demonstrate how the toroidal dipole moment is subradiant and difficult to excite by incident light. By means of breaking the geometric symmetry of the metamolecule, the toroidal mode can be excited by linearly polarized light and appears as a Fano resonance dip in the forward scattered light. We provide simple optimization protocols for maximizing the toroidal dipole mode excitation. This opens up possibilities for simplified control and driving of metamaterial arrays consisting of toroidal dipole unit-cell resonators.",physics,physics.optics,1
Dissipation-driven quantum phase transitions in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid electrostatically coupled to a metallic gate,"The dissipation induced by a metallic gate on the low-energy properties of interacting 1D electron liquids is studied. As function of the distance to the gate, or the electron density in the wire, the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state to two kinds of dissipative phases, one of them with a finite spatial correlation length. We also define a dual model, which describes an attractive one dimensional metal with a Josephson coupling to a dirty metallic lead.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Electron-hole asymmetry in two-terminal graphene devices,"A theoretical model is proposed to describe asymmetric gate-voltage dependence of conductance and noise in two-terminal ballistic graphene devices. The model is analyzed independently within the self-consistent Hartree and Thomas-Fermi approximations. Our results justify the prominent role of metal contacts in recent experiments with suspended graphene flakes. The contact-induced electrostatic potentials in graphene demonstrate a power-law decay with the exponent varying from -1 to -0.5. Within our model we explain electron-hole asymmetry and strong Fabri-Perot oscillations of the conductance and noise at positive doping, which were observed in many experiments with submicrometer samples. Limitations of the Thomas-Fermi approximation in a vicinity of the Dirac point are discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Quantum criticality and correlations in the cuprate superconductors,A description of the electronic correlations contained in the Hubbard model on the square-lattice perturbed by very weak three-dimensional uniaxial anisotropy in terms of the residual interactions of charge $c$ fermions and spin-neutral composite two-spinon $s1$ fermions is used to access further information on the origin of quantum critical behavior in the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. Excellent quantitative agreement with their anisotropic linear-$\omega$ one-electron scattering rate and normal-state linear-$T$ resistivity is achieved. Our results provide strong evidence that the normal-state linear-$T$ resistivity is indeed a manifestation of low-temperature scale-invariant physics.,cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Instability of the Non-Fermi-Liquid Fixed Point in the Dissipative Gauge Theory of Fermions (I)Impurity Effects,"We study a dissipative gauge theory of nonrelativistic fermions in 2+1 dimensions at zero temperature by the Wilsonian renormalization-group method. In this theory, we incorporate in the fermion propagator a new term of the form $ i \kappa \cdot\sign(\omega)$ (where $\kappa$ is a parameter and $\omega$ is the fermion frequency), which is usually induced by impurity effects. In the previous papers, we studied this system for $\kappa = 0$, and showed that there exists a non-Fermi-liquid infrared fixed point. In this paper, we address the question whether this non-Fermi-liquid behavior remains stable or not in the presence of impurity effects, i.e., the $\kappa$ term. Our results show that the non-Fermi-liquid fixed point is unstable for $\kappa \neq 0$ and an effective gauge coupling constant tends to vanish at low energies. However, in intermediate energy scales, the behavior of correlation functions for $\kappa \neq 0$ is controlled by the non-Fermi-liquid fixed point at $\kappa=0$, i.e., a crossover phenomenon appears. Physical implications of this phenomenon are discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Hadronic Events at LEP,"The hadronic events collected by LEP between 1989 and 2000 have changed dramatically our understanding of QCD, which has now been established as a part of the Standard Model. Still in many sectors (nonperturbative in particular) science analysis needs to be completed, and some new studies are just starting.",hep,hep-ex,Measurement of the inclusive ttgamma cross section at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector,"A first measurement of the ttgamma cross section in pp collisions at the LHC using 1.04 fb^-1 of data taken with the ATLAS detector is presented. A total of 122 candidate events were identified in the single electron and single muon channels. The contributions from background processes with prompt photons, and with electrons or hadrons misidentified as photons were estimated reducing the dependence on simulations by the use of data-driven techniques. The resulting cross section times branching ratio into the single lepton and dilepton decay channels for photons with pt > 8 GeV reads \sigma_ttgamma * BR = 1.9 pm 0.5 (stat.) pm 0.8 (syst.) pm 0.1 (lumi.) pb, which is consistent with the Standard Model expectation from theoretical calculations. The significance of the ttgamma signal was estimated to 2.5 \sigma.",hep,hep-ex,1
Theory of diffusive {\phi}0 Josephson junctions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling,"We present a full microscopic theory based on the SU(2) covariant formulation of the quasiclassical formalism to describe the Josephson current through an extended superconductor-normal metal- superconductor (SNS) diffusive junction with an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the presence of a spin-splitting field h. We demonstrate that the ground state of the junction corresponds to a finite intrinsic phase difference 0 < {\phi}0 < 2{\pi} between the superconductor electrodes provided that both, h and the SOC-induced SU(2) Lorentz force are finite. In the particular case of a Rashba SOC we present analytic and numerical results for {\phi}0 as a function of the strengths of the spin fields, the length of the junction, the temperature and the properties of SN interfaces.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,Phase Diagram of Ba1-xKxFe2As2,"We report the results of a systematic investigation of the phase diagram of the iron-based superconductor, Ba1-xKxFe2As2, from x = 0 to x = 1.0 using high resolution neutron and x-ray diffraction and magnetization measurements. The polycrystalline samples were prepared with an estimated compositional variation of \Deltax <~ 0.01, allowing a more precise estimate of the phase boundaries than reported so far. At room temperature, Ba1-xKxFe2As2 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure with the space group symmetry of I4/mmm, but at low doping, the samples undergo a coincident first-order structural and magnetic phase transition to an orthorhombic (O) structure with space group Fmmm and a striped antiferromagnet (AF) with space group Fcmm'm'. The transition temperature falls from a maximum of 139K in the undoped compound to 0K at x = 0.252, with a critical exponent as a function of doping of 0.25(2) and 0.12(1) for the structural and magnetic order parameters, respectively. The onset of superconductivity occurs at a critical concentration of x = 0.130(3) and the superconducting transition temperature grows linearly with x until it crosses the AF/O phase boundary. Below this concentration, there is microscopic phase coexistence of the AF/O and superconducting order parameters, although a slight suppression of the AF/O order is evidence that the phases are competing. At higher doping, superconductivity has a maximum Tc of 38 K at x = 0.4 falling to 3 K at x = 1.0. We discuss reasons for the suppression of the spin-density-wave order and the electron-hole asymmetry in the phase diagram.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,1
Dynamic hybrid metasurfaces,"Efficient hybrid plasmonic-photonic metasurfaces that simultaneously take advantage of the potential of both pure metallic and all-dielectric nanoantennas are identified as an emerging technology in flat optics. Nevertheless, post-fabrication tunable hybrid metasurfaces are still elusive. Here, we present a reconfigurable hybrid metasurface platform by incorporating the phase-change material Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{5}$ (GST) into metal-dielectric meta-atoms for active and non-volatile tuning of properties of light. We systematically design a reduced-dimension meta-atom, which selectively controls the fundamental hybrid plasmonic-photonic resonances of the metasurface via the dynamic change of optical constants of GST without compromising the scattering efficiency. As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally demonstrate miniaturized tunable metasurfaces that control the amplitude and phase of incident light necessary for high-contrast optical switching and anomalous to specular beam deflection, respectively. Finally, we leverage a deep learning-based approach to present an intuitive low-dimensional visualization of the enhanced range of response reconfiguration enabled by the addition of GST. Our findings further substantiate dynamically tunable hybrid metasurfaces as promising candidates for the development of small-footprint energy harvesting, imaging, and optical signal processing devices.",physics,physics.app-ph,Nanoscale probing of image-potential states and electron transfer doping in borophene polymorphs,"Using field-emission resonance spectroscopy with an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope, we reveal Stark-shifted image-potential states of the v_1/6 and v_1/5 borophene polymorphs on Ag(111) with long lifetimes, suggesting high borophene lattice and interface quality. These image-potential states allow the local work function and interfacial charge transfer of borophene to be probed at the nanoscale and test the widely employed self-doping model of borophene. Supported by apparent barrier height measurements and density functional theory calculations, electron transfer doping occurs for both borophene phases from the Ag(111) substrate. In contradiction with the self-doping model, a higher electron transfer doping level occurs for denser v_1/6 borophene compared to v_1/5 borophene, thus revealing the importance of substrate effects on borophene electron transfer.",physics,physics.app-ph,1
Operatorial characterization of Majorana neutrinos,"The Majorana neutrino $\psi_{M}(x)$ when constructed as a superposition of chiral fermions such as $\nu_{L} + C\overline{\nu_{L}}^{T}$ is characterized by $ ({\cal C}{\cal P}) \psi_{M}(x)({\cal C}{\cal P})^{\dagger} =i\gamma^{0}\psi_{M}(t,-\vec{x})$, and the CP symmetry describes the entire physics contents of Majorana neutrinos. Further specifications of C and P separately could lead to difficulties depending on the choice of C and P. The conventional $ {\cal C} \psi_{M}(x) {\cal C}^{\dagger} = \psi_{M}(x)$ with well-defined P is naturally defined when one constructs the Majorana neutrino from the Dirac-type fermion. In the seesaw model of Type I or Type I+II where the same number of left- and right-handed chiral fermions appear, it is possible to use the generalized Pauli-Gursey transformation to rewrite the seesaw Lagrangian in terms of Dirac-type fermions only; the conventional C symmetry then works to define Majorana neutrinos. In contrast, the ""pseudo C-symmetry"" $\nu_{L,R}(x)\rightarrow C\overline{\nu_{L,R}(x)}^{T}$ (and associated ""pseudo P-symmetry""), that has been often used in both the seesaw model and Weinberg's model to describe Majorana neutrinos, attempts to assign a nontrivial charge conjugation transformation rule to each chiral fermion separately. But this common construction is known to be operatorially ill-defined and, for example, the amplitude of the neutrinoless double beta decay vanishes if the vacuum is assumed to be invariant under the pseudo C-symmetry.",hep,hep-ph,Single Field Baryogenesis,"We propose a new variant of the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis mechanism in which a rolling scalar field couples directly to left- and right-handed neutrinos, generating a Dirac mass term through neutrino Yukawa interactions. In this setup, there are no explicitly CP violating couplings in the Lagrangian. The rolling scalar field is also taken to be uncharged under the $B - L$ quantum numbers. During the phase of rolling, scalar field decays generate a non-vanishing number density of left-handed neutrinos, which then induce a net baryon number density via electroweak sphaleron transitions.",hep,hep-ph,1
Relativistic corrections for two- and three-body flux tube model,"We generalize the relativistic flux tube model for arbitrary two- or three-body systems. The spin-independent and spin-dependent contributions of the flux tube to the total Hamiltonian are computed in perturbation. In particular, we show that the spin-dependent part exhibits a universal spin-orbit form: It does not depend on the nature of the confined particles. The general equations we present, being well-defined for light particles, can thus be applied to usual as well as exotic hadrons such as hybrid mesons and glueballs.",hep,hep-ph,"Hadronic Higgs production through NLO+PS in the SM, the 2HDM and the MSSM","The NLO cross section of the gluon fusion process is matched to parton showers in the MC@NLO approach. We work in the framework of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and document the inclusion of the full quark-mass dependence in the SM as well as the state-of-the-art squark and gluino effects within the MSSM embodied in the program SusHi. The combination of the two programs is realized by a script which is publicly available and whose usage is detailed. We discuss the input cards and the relevant parameter switches. One of our focuses is on the shower scale which is specifically important for gluon-induced Higgs production, particularly in models with enhanced Higgs-bottom Yukawa coupling.",hep,hep-ph,1
Renyi Entropies of Interacting Fermions from Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations,"Entanglement measures such as the entanglement entropy have become an indispensable tool to identify the fundamental character of ground states of interacting quantum many-body systems. For systems of interacting spin or bosonic degrees of freedom much recent progress has been made not only in the analytical description of their respective entanglement entropies but also in their numerical classification. Systems of interacting fermionic degrees of freedom however have proved to be more difficult to control, in particular with regard to the numerical understanding of their entanglement properties. Here we report a generalization of the replica technique for the calculation of Renyi entropies to the framework of determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo simulations -- the numerical method of choice for unbiased, large-scale simulations of interacting fermionic systems. We demonstrate the strength of this approach over a recent alternative proposal based on a decomposition in free fermion Green's functions by studying the entanglement entropy of one-dimensional Hubbard systems both at zero and finite temperatures.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,A Note on Lars Onsager and the Partition Functions of Cubic Lattice Models,An $n$-dimensional generalization of the Onsager Ising partition function integral is reduced to a single integral and applied to evaluate the partition function and residual entropy of an eight vertex model.,cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
Hyperuniformity and its Generalizations,"Disordered many-particle hyperuniform systems are exotic amorphous states characterized by anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations. Here we substantially broaden the hyperuniformity concept along four different directions. This includes generalizations to treat fluctuations in the interfacial area in heterogeneous media and surface-area driven evolving microstructures, random scalar fields, divergence-free random vector fields, as well as statistically anisotropic many-particle systems and two-phase media. Interfacial-area fluctuations play a major role in characterizing the microstructure of two-phase systems , physical properties that intimately depend on the geometry of the interface, and evolving two-phase microstructures that depend on interfacial energies (e.g., spinodal decomposition). In the instances of divergence-free random vector fields and statistically anisotropic structures, we show that the standard definition of hyperuniformity must be generalized such that it accounts for the dependence of the relevant spectral functions on the direction in which the origin in Fourier space (nonanalyticities at the origin). Using this analysis, we place some well-known energy spectra from the theory of isotropic turbulence in the context of this generalization of hyperuniformity. We show that there exist many-particle ground-state configurations in which directional hyperuniformity imparts exotic anisotropic physical properties (e.g., elastic, optical and acoustic characteristics) to these states of matter. Such tunablity could have technological relevance for manipulating light and sound waves in ways heretofore not thought possible. We show that disordered many-particle systems that respond to external fields (e.g., magnetic and electric fields) are a natural class of materials to look for directional hyperuniformity.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Writhe-induced knotting in a lattice polymer,"We consider a simple lattice model of a topological phase transition in open polymers. To be precise, we study a model of self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice tethered to a surface and weighted by an appropriately defined writhe. We also consider the effect of pulling the untethered end of the polymer from the surface. Regardless of the force we find a first-order phase transition which we argue is a consequence of increased knotting in the lattice polymer, rather than due to other effects such as the formation of plectonemes.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
Holographic thermalization and Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse,"The Oppenheimer-Snyder model, which describes the gravitational collapse of a ball of dust, can be used to model thermalization of strongly coupled systems using the AdS/CFT-duality. It can be used as an alternative to the previously widely used thin-shell model in the context of holographic thermalization. We solve the dynamics of the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse in asymptotically AdS space-times and compute the two-point function of a boundary spectator field in the geodesic approximation. As a comparison we perform the same computation in the thin-shell model and discover oscillatory solutions of the thin-shell model for certain equations of state.",hep,hep-th,Quantum Corrections to the Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman Metrics: Spin 1,A previous evaluation of one-photon loop corrections to the energy-momentum tensor has been extended to particles with unit spin and speculations are presented concerning general properties of such forms.,hep,hep-th,1
The Role of N2 as a Geo-Biosignature for the Detection and Characterization of Earth-like Habitats,"Since the Archean, N2 has been a major atmospheric constituent in Earth's atmosphere. Nitrogen is an essential element in the building blocks of life, therefore the geobiological nitrogen cycle is a fundamental factor in the long term evolution of both Earth and Earth-like exoplanets. We discuss the development of the Earth's N2 atmosphere since the planet's formation and its relation with the geobiological cycle. Then we suggest atmospheric evolution scenarios and their possible interaction with life forms: firstly, for a stagnant-lid anoxic world, secondly for a tectonically active anoxic world, and thirdly for an oxidized tectonically active world. Furthermore, we discuss a possible demise of present Earth's biosphere and its effects on the atmosphere. Since life forms are the most efficient means for recycling deposited nitrogen back into the atmosphere nowadays, they sustain its surface partial pressure at high levels. Also, the simultaneous presence of significant N2 and O2 is chemically incompatible in an atmosphere over geological timescales. Thus, we argue that an N2-dominated atmosphere in combination with O2 on Earth-like planets within circumstellar habitable zones can be considered as a geo-biosignature. Terrestrial planets with such atmospheres will have an operating tectonic regime connected with an aerobe biosphere, whereas other scenarios in most cases end up with a CO2-dominated atmosphere. We conclude with implications for the search for life on Earth-like exoplanets inside the habitable zones of M to K-stars.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,The Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler (HEK): V. A Survey of 41 Planetary Candidates for Exomoons,"We present a survey of 41 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) for exomoons using Bayesian photodynamics, more than tripling the number of KOIs surveyed with this technique. We find no compelling evidence for exomoons although thirteen KOIs yield spurious detections driven by instrumental artifacts, stellar activity and/or perturbations from unseen bodies. Regarding the latter, we find seven KOIs exhibiting >5 sigma evidence of transit timing variations, including the 'mega-Earth' Kepler-10c, likely indicating an additional planet in that system. We exploit the moderately large sample of 57 unique KOIs surveyed to date to infer several useful statistics. For example, although there is a diverse range in sensitivities, we find that we are sensitive to Pluto-Charon mass-ratio systems for ~40% of KOIs studied and Earth-Moon mass-ratios for 1 in 8 cases. In terms of absolute mass, our limits probe down to 1.7 Ganymede masses, with a sensitivity to Earth-mass moons for 1 in 3 cases studied and to the smallest moons capable of sustaining an Earth-like atmosphere (0.3 Earth masses) for 1 in 4. Despite the lack of positive detections to date, we caution against drawing conclusions yet, since our most interesting objects remain under analysis. Finally, we point out that had we searched for the photometric transit signals of exomoons alone, rather than using photodynamics, we estimate that 1 in 4 KOIs would have erroneously been concluded to harbor exomoons due to residual time correlated noise in the Kepler data, posing a serious problem for alternative methods.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,1
Towards physics responsible for large-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ forest bias parameters,"Using a series of carefully constructed numerical experiments based on hydrodynamic cosmological SPH simulations, we attempt to build an intuition for the relevant physics behind the large scale density ($b_\delta$) and velocity gradient ($b_\eta$) biases of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Starting with the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation applied to the smoothed total density field in real-space, and progressing through redshift-space with no thermal broadening, redshift-space with thermal broadening and hydrodynamicaly simulated baryon fields, we investigate how approximations found in the literature fare. We find that Seljak's 2012 analytical formulae for these bias parameters work surprisingly well in the limit of no thermal broadening and linear redshift-space distortions. We also show that his $b_\eta$ formula is exact in the limit of no thermal broadening. Since introduction of thermal broadening significantly affects its value, we speculate that a combination of large-scale measurements of $b_\eta$ and the small scale flux PDF might be a sensitive probe of the thermal state of the IGM. We find that large-scale biases derived from the smoothed total matter field are within 10-20\% to those based on hydrodynamical quantities, in line with other measurements in the literature.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,The Substructure Hierarchy in Dark Matter Haloes,"We present a new algorithm for identifying the substructure within simulated dark matter haloes. The method is an extension of that proposed by Tormen et al. (2004) and Giocoli et al. (2008a), which identifies a subhalo as a group of self-bound particles that prior to being accreted by the main progenitor of the host halo belonged to one and the same progenitor halo (hereafter satellite). However, this definition does not account for the fact that these satellite haloes themselves may also have substructure, which thus gives rise to sub-subhaloes, etc. Our new algorithm identifies substructures at all levels of this hierarchy, and we use it to determine the mass function of all substructure (counting sub-haloes, sub-subhaloes, etc.). On average, haloes which formed more recently tend to have a larger mass fraction in substructure and to be less concentrated than average haloes of the same mass. We provide quantitative fits to these correlations. Even though our algorithm is very different from that of Gao et al. (2004), we too find that the subhalo mass function per unit mass at redshift z = 0 is universal. This universality extends to any redshift only if one accounts for the fact that host haloes of a given mass are less concentrated at higher redshifts, and concentration and substructure abundance are anti-correlated. This universality allows a simple parametrization of the subhalo mass function integrated over all host halo masses, at any given time. We provide analytic fits to this function which should be useful in halo model analyses which equate galaxies with halo substructure when interpreting clustering in large sky surveys. Finally, we discuss systematic differences in the subhalo mass function that arise from different definitions of (host) halo mass.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Higher-order topological insulators and superconductors protected by inversion symmetry,"We study surface states of topological crystalline insulators and superconductors protected by inversion symmetry. These fall into the category of ""higher-order"" topological insulators and superconductors which possess surface states that propagate along one-dimensional curves (hinges) or are localized at some points (corners) on the surface. We show that the surface states of higher-order topological insulators and superconductors can be thought of as globally irremovable topological defects and provide a complete classification of these inversion-protected phases in any spatial dimension for the ten symmetry classes by means of a layer construction. Furthermore, we discuss possible physical realizations of such states starting with a time-reversal invariant topological insulator (class AII) in three dimensions or a time-reversal invariant topological superconductor (class DIII) in two or three dimensions. The former can be used to build a three-dimensional second-order topological insulator which exhibits one-dimensional chiral or helical modes propagating along opposite edges, whereas the latter enables the construction of three-dimensional third-order or two-dimensional second-order topological superconductors hosting Majorana zero modes localized to two opposite corners. Being protected by inversion, such states are not pinned to a specific pair of edges or corners thus offering the possibility of controlling their location by applying inversion-symmetric perturbations such as magnetic field.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Coherent control via weak measurements in $^{31}$P single-atom electron and nuclear spin qubits,"The understanding of weak measurements and interaction-free measurements has greatly expanded the conceptual and experimental toolbox to explore the quantum world. Here we demonstrate single-shot variable-strength weak measurements of the electron and the nuclear spin states of a single $^{31}$P donor in silicon. We first show how the partial collapse of the nuclear spin due to measurement can be used to coherently rotate the spin to a desired pure state. We explicitly demonstrate that phase coherence is preserved throughout multiple sequential single-shot weak measurements, and that the partial state collapse can be reversed. Second, we use the relation between measurement strength and perturbation of the nuclear state as a physical meter to extract the tunneling rates between the $^{31}$P donor and a nearby electron reservoir from data, conditioned on observing no tunneling events. Our experiments open avenues to measurement-based state preparation, steering and feedback protocols for spin systems in the solid state, and highlight the fundamental connection between information gain and state modification in quantum mechanics.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
CO$_2$ Infrared Phonon Modes in Interstellar Ice Mixtures,"CO$_2$ ice is an important reservoir of carbon and oxygen in star and planet forming regions. Together with water and CO, CO$_2$ sets the physical and chemical characteristics of interstellar icy grain mantles, including desorption and diffusion energies for other ice constituents. A detailed understanding of CO$_2$ ice spectroscopy is a prerequisite to characterize CO$_2$ interactions with other volatiles both in interstellar ices and in laboratory experiments of interstellar ice analogs. We report laboratory spectra of the CO$_2$ longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode in pure CO$_2$ ice and in CO$_2$ ice mixtures with H$_2$O, CO, O$_2$ components. We show that the LO phonon mode position is sensitive to the mixing ratio of various ice components of astronomical interest. In the era of JWST, this characteristic could be used to constrain interstellar ice compositions and morphologies. More immediately, LO phonon mode spectroscopy provides a sensitive probe of ice mixing in the laboratory and should thus enable diffusion measurements with higher precision than has been previously possible.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Complex organic molecules detected in twelve high-mass star-forming regions with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA),"Recent astrochemical models and experiments have explained that complex organic molecules (COMs; molecules composed of six or more atoms) are produced on the dust grain mantles in cold and dense gas in prestellar cores. However, the detailed chemical processes and the roles of physical conditions on chemistry are still far from understood. To address these questions, we investigated twelve high-mass star-forming regions using the ALMA band 6 observations. They are associated with 44/95GHz class I and 6.7 GHz class II CH$_{3}$OH masers, indicative of undergoing active accretion. We found 28 hot cores with COMs emission among 68 continuum peaks at 1.3 mm and specified 10 hot cores associated with 6.7 GHz class II CH$_{3}$OH masers. Up to 19 COMs are identified including oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing molecules and their isotopologues in cores. The derived abundances show a good agreement with those from other low- and high-mass star-forming regions, implying that the COMs chemistry is predominantly set by the ice chemistry in the prestellar core stage. One clear trend is that the COMs detection rate steeply grows with the gas column density, which can be attributed to the efficient formation of COMs in dense cores. In addition, cores associated with a 6.7 GHz class II CH$_{3}$OH maser tend to be enriched with COMs. Finally, our results suggest that the enhanced abundances of several molecules in our hot cores could be originated by the active accretion as well as different physical conditions of cores.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Measurements of Extended Magnetic Fields in Laser-Solid Interaction,"Magnetic fields generated from a laser-foil interaction are measured with high fidelity using a proton radiography scheme with in situ x-ray fiducials. In contrast to prior findings under similar experimental conditions, this technique reveals the self-generated, Biermann-battery fields extend beyond the edge of the expanding plasma plume to a radius of over 3.5 mm by t=+1.4 ns, a result not captured in state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamics simulations. An analysis of two mono-energetic proton populations confirms that proton deflection is dominated by magnetic fields far from the interaction (>2 mm) and electric fields are insignificant. Comparisons to prior work suggest a new physics mechanism for the magnetic field generation and transport in laser-solid interactions.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,Effect of density changes on tokamak plasma confinement,"A change of the particle density (by gas puff, pellets or impurity seeding) during the plasma discharge in tokamak produces a radial current and implicitly a torque and rotation that can modify the state of confinement. After ionization the newly born ions will evolve toward the periodic neoclassical orbits (trapped or circulating) but the first part of their excursion, which precedes the periodicity, is an effective radial current. It is short, spatially finite and unique for each new ion, but multiplied by the rate of ionization and it can produce a substantial total radial current. The associated torque induces rotation which modify the transport processes. We derive the magnitude of the radial current induced by ionization by three methods: the analysis of a simple physical picture, a numerical model and the neoclassical drift-kinetic treatment. The results of the three approaches are in agreement and show that the current can indeed be substantial. Many well known experimental observations can be reconsidered under this perspective. In reactor-grade plasma the confinement can be strongly influenced by adequate particle fuelling.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,1
Proposal for a new quantum theory of gravity,"We recall a classical theory of torsion gravity with an asymmetric metric, sourced by a Nambu-Goto + Kalb-Ramond string . We explain why this is a significant gravitational theory, and in what sense classical general relativity is an approximation to it. We propose that a non-commutative generalisation of this theory (in the sense of Connes' non-commutative geometry and Adler's Trace Dynamics) is a `quantum theory of gravity'. The theory is in fact a classical matrix dynamics with only two fundamental constants -- the square of the Planck length and the speed of light, along with the two string tensions as parameters. The guiding symmetry principle is that the theory should be covariant under general coordinate transformations of non-commuting coordinates.The action for this non-commutative torsion gravity can be elegantly expressed as an invariant area integral, and represents an atom of space-time-matter. The statistical thermodynamics of a large number of such atoms yields the laws of quantum gravity and quantum field theory, at thermodynamic equilibrium. Spontaneous localisation caused by large fluctuations away from equilibrium is responsible for the emergence of classical space-time and the field equations of classical general relativity. The resolution of the quantum measurement problem by spontaneous collapse is an inevitable consequence of this process. Quantum theory and general relativity, are both seen as emergent phenomena, resulting from coarse-graining of the underlying non-commutative geometry. We explain the profound role played by entanglement in this theory: entanglement describes interaction between the atoms of space-time-matter, and indeed entanglement appears to be more fundamental than quantum theory or space-time. We also comment on possible implications for black hole entropy and evaporation, and for cosmology.",hep,hep-th,The Bethe Ansatz for Z_S Orbifolds of N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory,"Worldsheet techniques can be used to argue for the integrability of string theory on AdS_5xS^5/Z_S, which is dual to the strongly coupled Z_S-orbifold of N=4 SYM. We analyze the integrability of these field theories in the perturbative regime and construct the relevant Bethe equations.",hep,hep-th,1
"Influence of material stretchability on the equilibrium shape of a M\""obius band","We use a discrete, lattice-based model for two-dimensional materials to show that M\""obius bands made with stretchable materials are less likely to crease or tear. This stems a delocalization of twisting strain that occurs if stretching is allowed. The associated low-energy configurations provide strategic target shapes for the guided assembly of nanometer and micron scale M\""obius bands. To predict macroscopic band shapes for a given material, we establish a connection between stretchability and relevant continuum moduli, leading to insight regarding the practical feasibility of synthesizing M\""obius bands from materials with continuum parameters that can be measured experimentally or estimated by upscale averaging. To take advantage of stretchability in the case of M\""obius bands made of graphene, DNA, and other effectively unstretchable materials, we develop and explore a novel architecture that uses the Chinese finger trap as a fundamental building block and imparts notable stretchability to otherwise unstretchable materials.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Near room temperature antiferromagnetic ordering with a potential low dimensional magnetism in AlMn$_2$B$_2$,"We present self flux growth and characterization of single crystalline AlMn$_2$B$_2$.

The anisotropic bulk magnetization data, electrical transport and $^{11}$B nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) data revealed an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at 313 $\pm$ 2 K. In the magnetization data, there is also a broad local maximum significantly above the AFM transition that could be a signature of low dimensional magnetic interactions in AlMn$_2$B$_2$.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Towards A Holographic Model of Color Superconductivity,"In this note, we discuss the basic elements that should appear in a gravitational system dual to a confining gauge theory displaying color superconductivity at large baryon density. We consider a simple system with these minimal elements, and show that for a range of parameters, the phase structure of this model as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential exhibits phases that can be identified with confined, deconfined, and color superconducting phases in the dual field theory. We find that the critical temperature at which the superconducting phase disappears is remarkably small (relative to the chemical potential). This small number arises from the dynamics, and is unrelated to any small parameter in the model that we study. We discuss similar models which exhibit flavor superconductivity.",hep,hep-th,Thick brane models in generalized mimetic gravity,"In this work, we investigate braneworld models in mimetic gravity, with the source field having generalized dynamics. We present the mathematical description necessary to study the generalized model and consider the first-order formalism to solve the equations of motion. We also investigate the linear stability of the gravitational sector to verify that the model is stable. In particular, we consider two specific situations where we were able to get exact solutions with a kink-like profile and calculate several important properties of the brane.",hep,hep-th,1
The Cosmological Constant Problem and Re-interpretation of Time,"We abandon the interpretation that time is a global parameter in quantum mechanics, replace it by a quantum dynamical variable playing the role of time. This operational re-interpretation of time provides a solution to the cosmological constant problem. The expectation value of the zero-point energy under the new time variable vanishes. The fluctuation of the vacuum energy as the leading contribution to the gravitational effect gives a correct order to the observed ""dark energy"". The ""dark energy"" as a mirage is always seen comparable with the matter energy density by an observer using the internal clock time. Conceptual consequences of the re-interpretation of time are also discussed.",physics,physics.gen-ph,Conservative relativity principle: Logical ground and analysis of relevant experiments,"We suggest a new relativity principle, which asserts the impossibility to distinguish the state of rest and the state of motion at the constant velocity of a system, if no work is done to the system in question during its motion. We suggest calling this new rule as ""conservative relativity principle"" (CRP). In the case of an empty space, CRP is reduced to the Einstein special relativity principle. We also show that CRP is compatible with the general relativity principle. One of important implications of CRP is the dependence of the proper time of a charged particle on the electric potential at its location. In the present paper we consider the relevant experimental facts gathered up to now, where the latter effect can be revealed. We show that in atomic physics the introduction of this effect furnishes a better convergence between theory and experiment than that provided by the standard approach. Finally, we reanalyze the Moessbauer experiments in rotating systems and show that the obtained recently puzzling deviation of the relative energy shift between emission and absorption lines from the relativistic prediction can be explained by the CRP.",physics,physics.gen-ph,1
Hadronic Parity-Violation on the Lattice,"We motivate lattice QCD studies of the parity-violating pion-nucleon coupling constant and extend flavor-conserving hadronic parity-violation from QCD to partially-quenched QCD. The parity-violating pion-nucleon coupling and the anapole form factor (and moment) of the proton are computed to one-loop order in the partially-quenched chiral expansion. For the parity-violating pion-nucleon interaction, we include the contributions from total derivative operators necessary to match the kinematics that will be used in lattice simulations.",nucl,nucl-th,Resonance poles and threshold energies for hadron physical problems by a model-independent universal algorithm,"We show how complex resonance poles and threshold energies for systems in hadron physics can be accurately obtained by using a method based on the Pad\'{e}-approximant which was recently developed for the calculation of resonance poles for atomic and molecular auto-ionization systems. The main advantage of this method is the ability to calculate the resonance poles and threshold energies from \emph{real} spectral data. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of this method we apply it here to an analytical model as well as to experimental data for the squared modulus of the vector pion form factor, the S0 partial wave amplitude for $\pi\pi$ scattering and the cross section ratio $R(s)$ for $e^+e^-$ collisions. The extracted values for the resonance poles of the $\rho(770)$ and the $f_0(500)$ or $\sigma$ meson are in very good agreement with the literature. When the data are noisy the prediction of decay thresholds proves to be less accurate but feasible.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Cooling of a $\Lambda$-type three-level atom in a high finesse optical cavity,"A theoretical study is carried out for the cavity cooling of a $\Lambda$-type three level atom in a high-finesse optical cavity with a weakly driven field. Analytical expressions for the friction, diffusion coefficients and the equilibrium temperatures are obtained by using the Heisenberg equations, then they are calculated numerically and shown graphically as a function of controlling parameters. For a suitable choice of these parameters, the dynamics of the cavity field interaction with the $\Lambda$-type three-level atom introduces a sisyphus cooling mechanism yielding lower temperatures below the Doppler limit and allowing larger cooling rate, avoiding the problems induced by spontaneous emission.",physics,physics.optics,Non-adiabatic transitions through exceptional points in the band structure of a PT-symmetric lattice,"Exceptional points, at which two or more eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian coalesce, occur in non-Hermitian systems and lead to surprising physical effects. In particular, the behaviour of a system under parameter variation can differ significantly from the familiar Hermitian case in the presence of exceptional points. Here we analytically derive the probability of a non-adiabatic transition in a two-level system driven through two consecutive exceptional points at finite speed. The system is Hermitian far away from the exceptional points. In the adiabatic limit an equal redistribution between the states coalescing in the exceptional point is observed, which can be interpreted as a loss of information when passing through the exceptional point. For finite parameter variation this gets modified. We demonstrate how the transition through the exceptional points can be experimentally addressed in a PT-symmetric lattice using Bloch oscillations.",physics,physics.optics,1
The evolution of Red Supergiants to supernova in the LMC cluster NGC 2100,"The mass loss rates of red supergiants (RSGs) govern their evolution towards supernova and dictate the appearance of the resulting explosion. To study how mass-loss rates change with evolution we measure the mass-loss rates (\mdot) and extinctions of 19 red supergiants in the young massive cluster NGC2100 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. By targeting stars in a coeval cluster we can study the mass-loss rate evolution whilst keeping the variables of mass and metallicity fixed. Mass-loss rates were determined by fitting DUSTY models to mid-IR photometry from WISE and Spitzer/IRAC. We find that the \mdot\ in red supergiants increases as the star evolves, and is well described by \mdot\ prescription of de Jager, used widely in stellar evolution calculations. We find the extinction caused by the warm dust is negligible, meaning the warm circumstellar material of the inner wind cannot explain the higher levels of extinction found in the RSGs compared to other cluster stars. We discuss the implications of this work in terms of supernova progenitors and stellar evolution theory. We argue there is little justification for substantially increasing the \mdot\ during the RSG phase, as has been suggested recently in order to explain the absence of high mass Type IIP supernova progenitors. We also argue that an increase in reddening towards the end of the RSG phase, as observed for the two most evolved cluster stars, may provide a solution to the red supergiant problem.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,A New Hybrid Technique for Modeling Dense Star Clusters,"The ""gravitational million-body problem,"" to model the dynamical evolution of a self-gravitating, collisional N-body system with ~10^6 particles over many relaxation times, remains a major challenge in computational astrophysics. Unfortunately, current techniques to model such systems suffer from severe limitations. A direct N-body simulation with more than 10^5 particles can require months or even years to complete, while an orbit-sampling Monte Carlo approach cannot adequately model the dynamics in a dense cluster core, particularly in the presence of many black holes. We have developed a new technique combining the precision of a direct N-body integration with the speed of a Monte Carlo approach. Our Rapid And Precisely Integrated Dynamics code, the RAPID code, statistically models interactions between neighboring stars and stellar binaries while integrating directly the orbits of stars or black holes in the cluster core. This allows us to accurately simulate the dynamics of the black holes in a realistic globular cluster environment without the burdensome N^2 scaling of a full N-body integration. We compare RAPID models of idealized globular clusters to identical models from the direct N-body and Monte Carlo methods. Our tests show that RAPID can reproduce the half-mass radii, core radii, black hole ejection rates, and binary properties of the direct N-body models far more accurately than a standard Monte Carlo integration while remaining significantly faster than a full N-body integration. With this technique, it will be possible to create more realistic models of Milky Way globular clusters with sufficient rapidity to explore the full parameter space of dense stellar clusters.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Hyper-order baryon number fluctuations at finite temperature and density,"Fluctuations of conserved charges are sensitive to the QCD phase transition and a possible critical endpoint in the phase diagram at finite density. In this work, we compute the baryon number fluctuations up to tenth order at finite temperature and density. This is done in a QCD-assisted effective theory that accurately captures the quantum- and in-medium effects of QCD at low energies. A direct computation at finite density allows us to assess the applicability of expansions around vanishing density. By using different freeze-out scenarios in heavy-ion collisions, we translate these results into baryon number fluctuations as a function of collision energy. We show that a non-monotonic energy dependence of baryon number fluctuations can arise in the non-critical crossover region of the phase diagram. Our results compare well with recent experimental measurements of the kurtosis and the sixth-order cumulant of the net-proton distribution from the STAR collaboration. They indicate that the experimentally observed non-monotonic energy dependence of fourth-order net-proton fluctuations is highly non-trivial. It could be an experimental signature of an increasingly sharp chiral crossover and may indicate a QCD critical point. The physics implications and necessary upgrades of our analysis are discussed in detail.",nucl,nucl-ex,Accurate nuclear radii and binding energies from a chiral interaction,"With the goal of developing predictive ab-initio capability for light and medium-mass nuclei, two-nucleon and three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory are optimized simultaneously to low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering data, as well as binding energies and radii of few-nucleon systems and selected isotopes of carbon and oxygen. Coupled-cluster calculations based on this interaction, named NNLO$_{\rm sat}$, yield accurate binding energies and radii of nuclei up to $^{40}$Ca, and are consistent with the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter. In addition, the low-lying collective $J^\pi=3^-$ states in $^{16}$O and $^{40}$Ca are described accurately, while spectra for selected $p$- and $sd$-shell nuclei are in reasonable agreement with experiment.",nucl,nucl-ex,1
Dynamical renormalization group approach to the Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov equations,The Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov equations for the parton distribution functions are rederived using the dynamical renormalization group approach to quantum kinetics. This method systematically treats the ln Q^2 corrections that arises in perturbation theory as a renormalization of the parton distribution function and unambiguously indicates that the strong coupling must be allowed to run with the scale in the evolution kernel. To leading logarithmic accuracy the evolution equation is Markovian and the logarithmic divergences in the perturbative expansion are identified with the secular divergences (terms that grow in time) that emerge in a perturbative treatment of the kinetic equations in nonequilibrium systems. The resummation of the leading logarithms by the Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov equation is thus similar to the resummation of the leading secular terms by the Boltzmann kinetic equation.,hep,hep-ph,Dark Matter and Dark Force in the Type-I Inert 2HDM with Local U(1)_H Gauge Symmetry,"We discuss dark matter (DM) physics in the Type-I inert two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) with local U(1)_H Higgs gauge symmetry. The local U(1)_H gauge symmetry is assigned to the extra Higgs doublet in order to avoid the Higgs-mediated flavor problems, and it spontaneously breaks down to its discrete subgroup. The lightest neutral scalar component H of the U(1)_H-charged Higgs doublet, which does not have Yukawa couplings with the Standard-Model (SM) fermions, is stable because of the remnant discrete symmetry, and it interacts with the SM particles through the U(1)_H gauge boson (Z_H) exchange as well as the SM boson exchange. We first investigate the constraint on the U(1)_H gauge interaction, especially through the kinetic and mass mixing between the SM gauge bosons and the extra gauge boson. Then we discuss dark matter physics in our 2HDM: thermal relic density, and direct/indirect detections of dark matter. The additional U(1)_H gauge interaction plays a crucial role in reducing the DM thermal relic density. The most important result within the inert DM model with local U(1)_H symmetry is that ~ O(10) GeV dark matter scenario, which is strongly disfavored in the usual Inert Doublet Model (IDM) with Z_2 symmetry, is revived in our model because of newly open channels, H H -> Z_H Z_H , Z_H Z. Exotic Higgs decays, h -> Z_H Z_H, Z Z_H, would be distinctive signatures of the inert 2HDM with local U(1)_H symmetry.",hep,hep-ph,1
Molecular structure elucidation with charge-state control,"The charge state of a molecule governs its physicochemical properties, such as conformation, reactivity and aromaticity, with implications for on-surface synthesis, catalysis, photo conversion and applications in molecular electronics. On insulating, multilayer NaCl films we control the charge state of organic molecules and resolve their structures in neutral, cationic, anionic and dianionic states by atomic force microscopy, obtaining atomic resolution and bond-order discrimination using CO functionalized tips. We detect changes in conformation, adsorption geometry and bond-order relations for azobenzene, tetracyanoquinodimethane and pentacene in multiple charge states.

Has JWST already falsified dark-matter-driven galaxy formation?,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered several luminous high-redshift galaxy candidates with stellar masses of $M_{*} \gtrsim 10^{9} \, \rm{M_{\odot}}$ at photometric redshifts $z_{\mathrm{phot}} \gtrsim 10$ which allows to constrain galaxy and structure formation models. For example, Adams et al. identified the candidate ID 1514 with $\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) = {9.8}_{-0.2}^{+0.2}$ located at $z_{\mathrm{phot}} = 9.85_{-0.12}^{+0.18}$ and Naidu et al. found even more distant candidates labeled as GL-z11 and GL-z13 with $\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) = 9.4_{-0.3}^{+0.3}$ at $z_{\mathrm{phot}}=10.9_{-0.4}^{+0.5}$ and $\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) = 9.0_{-0.4}^{+0.3}$ at $z_{\mathrm{phot}} = 13.1_{-0.7}^{+0.8}$, respectively. Assessing the computations of the IllustrisTNG (TNG50-1 and TNG100-1) and EAGLE projects, we investigate if the stellar mass buildup as predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm is consistent with these observations assuming that the early JWST calibration is correct and that the candidates are indeed located at $z \gtrsim 10$. Galaxies formed in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm are by more than an order of magnitude less massive in stars than the observed galaxy candidates implying that the stellar mass buildup is more efficient in the early Universe than predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM models. This in turn would suggest that structure formation is more enhanced at $z \gtrsim 10$ than predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We show that different star formation histories could reduce the stellar masses of the galaxy candidates alleviating the tension. Finally, we calculate the galaxy-wide initial mass function (gwIMF) of the galaxy candidates assuming the integrated galaxy IMF theory. The gwIMF becomes top-heavy for metal-poor starforming galaxies decreasing therewith the stellar masses compared to an invariant canonical IMF.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,The AIMSS Project I: Bridging the Star Cluster - Galaxy Divide,"We describe the structural and kinematic properties of the first compact stellar systems discovered by the AIMSS project. These spectroscopically confirmed objects have sizes ($\sim$6 $<$ R$_{\rm e}$ [pc] $<$ 500) and masses ($\sim$2$\times$10$^{6}$ $<$ M$_*$/M$_\odot$ $<$ 6$\times$10$^{9}$) spanning the range of massive globular clusters (GCs), ultra compact dwarfs (UCDs) and compact elliptical galaxies (cEs), completely filling the gap between star clusters and galaxies. Several objects are close analogues to the prototypical cE, M32. These objects, which are more massive than previously discovered UCDs of the same size, further call into question the existence of a tight mass-size trend for compact stellar systems, while simultaneously strengthening the case for a universal ""zone of avoidance"" for dynamically hot stellar systems in the mass-size plane. Overall, we argue that there are two classes of compact stellar systems: 1) massive star clusters and 2) a population closely related to galaxies. Our data provide indications for a further division of the galaxy-type UCD/cE population into two groups, one population that we associate with objects formed by the stripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies, and a second population that formed through the stripping of bulged galaxies or are lower-mass analogues of classical ellipticals. We find compact stellar systems around galaxies in low to high density environments, demonstrating that the physical processes responsible for forming them do not only operate in the densest clusters.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
How many-body correlations and $\alpha$-clustering shape $^6$He,"The Borromean $^6$He nucleus is an exotic system characterized by two `halo' neutrons orbiting around a compact $^4$He (or $\alpha$) core, in which the binary subsystems are unbound. The simultaneous reproduction of its small binding energy and extended matter and point-proton radii has been a challenge for {\em ab initio} theoretical calculations based on traditional bound-state methods. Using soft nucleon-nucleon interactions based on chiral effective field theory potentials, we show that supplementing the model space with $^4$He+$n$+$n$ cluster degrees of freedom largely solves this issue. We analyze the role played by the $\alpha$-clustering and many-body correlations, and study the dependence of the energy spectrum on the resolution scale of the interaction.",nucl,nucl-th,Nuclear modification factor in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions,"The transverse momentum dependent nuclear modification factors (NMF), namely $R_{CP}$, is investigated for protons produced in Au + Au at 1$A$ GeV within the framework of the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model. It is found that the radial collective motion during the expansion stage affects the NMF at low transverse momentum a lot. By fitting the transverse mass spectra of protons with the distribution function from the Blast-Wave model, the magnitude of radial flow can be extracted. After removing the contribution from radial flow, the $R_{CP}$ can be regarded as a thermal one and is found to keep unitary at transverse momentum lower than 0.6 GeV/c and enhance at higher transverse momentum, which can be attributed to Cronin effect.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Active Colloidal Loops and Knots,"We present an asymptotic theory for solving the dynamics of slender autophoretic loops and knots. Our formulation is valid for non-intersecting 3D centrelines, with arbitrary chemical patterning and varying (circular) cross-sectional radius, allowing a broad class of slender active loops and knots to be studied. The theory is amenable to closed-form solutions in simpler cases, allowing us to analytically derive the swimming speed of chemically patterned tori, and the pumping strength (stresslet) of a uniformly active slender torus. Using simple numerical solutions of our asymptotic equations, we then elucidate the behaviour of many exotic active colloids, such as a bumpy uniformly active torus that spins and a Janus trefoil knot, which rotates as it swims forwards.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Defect unbinding in active nematics,"We formulate the statistical dynamics of topological defects in the active nematic phase, formed in two dimensions by a collection of self-driven particles on a substrate. An important consequence of the non-equilibrium drive is the spontaneous motility of strength +1/2 disclinations. Starting from the hydrodynamic equations of active nematics, we derive an interacting particle description of defects that includes active torques. We show that activity, within perturbation theory, lowers the defect-unbinding transition temperature, determining a critical line in the temperature-activity plane that separates the quasi-long-range ordered (nematic) and disordered (isotropic) phases. Below a critical activity, defects remain bound as rotational noise decorrelates the directed dynamics of +1/2 defects, stabilizing the quasi-long-range ordered nematic state. This activity threshold vanishes at low temperature, leading to a re-entrant transition. At large enough activity, active forces always exceed thermal ones and the perturbative result fails, suggesting that in this regime activity will always disorder the system. Crucially, rotational diffusion being a two-dimensional phenomenon, defect unbinding cannot be described by a simplified one-dimensional model.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Dual Superconformal Symmetry of ${\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory with Fundamental Matter at Large $N$,"Dual conformal symmetry and Yangian symmetry are symmetries of amplitudes that have aided the study of scattering amplitudes in highly supersymmetric theories like ${\cal N}=4$ SYM and ABJM. However, in general such symmetries are absent from the theories with lesser or no supersymmetry. In this paper, we show that the tree level $2\to 2$ scattering amplitude in the 3d ${\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to a fundamental chiral multiplet is dual superconformal invariant. In the 't Hooft large $N$ limit, the $2\to 2$ scattering amplitude in this theory has been shown to be tree-level exact in non-anyonic channels, while having only an overall multiplicative coupling dependent renormalisation in the anyonic channel. Therefore, the dual superconformal symmetry that we demonstrate in this paper is all loop exact. This is unlike the previously studied highly supersymmetric theories where dual superconformal symmetry is anomalous at loop levels. Furthermore, we reverse the argument to study the extent to which dual superconformal invariance fixes the scattering amplitude in an ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric theory. We demonstrate that requiring the dual superconformal invariance completely fixes the momentum dependence of the $2\to2$ amplitude, while the coupling constant dependence remain unfixed. Further, we use a combination of parity invariance, unitarity and self-duality of the amplitude to constrain the coupling dependence of scattering amplitude.",hep,hep-th,On polynomial solutions of Heun equation,"By making use of a recently developed method to solve linear differential equations of arbitrary order, we find a wide class of polynomial solutions to the Heun equation. We construct the series solution to the Heun equation before identifying the polynomial solutions. The Heun equation extended by the addition of a term, $- \s/x$, is also amenable for polynomial solutions.",hep,hep-th,1
Field-enhanced critical parameters in magnetically nanostructured superconductors,"Within the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, we demonstrate the enhancement of superconductivity in a superconducting film, when nanostructured by a lattice of magnetic particles. Arrays of out-of-plane magnetized dots (MDs) extend the critical magnetic field and critical current the sample can sustain, due to the interaction of the vortex-antivortex pairs and surrounding supercurrents induced by the dots and the external flux lines. Depending on the stability of the vortex-antivortex lattice, a peak in the Hext-T boundary is found for applied integer and rational matching fields, which agrees with recent experiments [Lange et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 197006 (2003)]. Due to compensation of MDs- and Hext-induced currents, we predict the field-shifted jc-Hext characteristics, as was actually realized in previous experiment but not commented on [Morgan and Ketterson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 3614 (1998)].",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,Photoemission Evidence for a Remnant Fermi Surface and d-Wave-Like Dispersion in Insulating Ca2CuO2Cl2,"An angle resolved photoemission study on Ca2CuO2Cl2, a parent compound of high Tc superconductors is reported. Analysis of the electron occupation probability, n(k) from the spectra shows a steep drop in spectral intensity across a contour that is close to the Fermi surface predicted by the band calculation. This analysis reveals a Fermi surface remnant even though Ca2CuO2Cl2 is a Mott insulator. The lowest energy peak exhibits a dispersion with approximately the |cos(kxa)-cos(kya)| form along this remnant Fermi surface. Together with the data from Dy doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8 + delta) these results suggest that this d-wave like dispersion of the insulator is the underlying reason for the pseudo gap in the underdoped regime.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,1
Te Doped Indium (II) Selenide Photocatalyst for Water Splitting: A First Principles Study,"Graphene like 2D materials have attracted tremendous attention in the field of photocatalytic water splitting. Indium Selenide (InSe) is one such potential material. Here, we report the effect of Tellurium on InSe monolayer for the photocatalytic water splitting by means of density functional calculations. The calculated bandgaps fall within the visible region of the solar spectrum indicating these materials could absorb a significant amount of solar light. Density of states calculations show that the covalent character is present between the atoms which is typical for the layered system. The band alignment with respect to redox potentials show that Te doped InSe is more favorable for the hydrogen reduction reaction than the pristine InSe monolayer. Our overall results show that Te substitution improves the photocatalytic water splitting ability in InSe monolayer.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Sensitivity of Crystal Stress Distributions to the Definition of Virtual Two-Phase Microstructures,A systematic study of the sensitivities of simulation input on the computed stress distributions in two-phase microstructures is presented. The study supports a related investigation of the initiation and propagation of yielding in duplex stainless steel. Considered in the study are the identification of constitutive model parameters for the single-crystal elastic and plastic behaviors and the importance of including dominant phase and grain morphologies in the instantiation of virtual samples. Behaviors computed using a finite element formulation are evaluated against experimental data for the macroscopic stress-strain behavior and against lattice strain data measured by neutron diffraction under in situ loading.,cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Neutral carbon and highly excited CO in a massive star-forming main sequence galaxy at z=2.2,"We used the Plateau De Bure Interferometer to observe multiple CO and neutral carbon transitions in a z=2.2 main sequence disk galaxy, BX610. Our observation of CO(7-6), CO(4-3), and both far-infrared(FIR) [CI] lines complements previous observations of H$\alpha$ and low-J CO, and reveals a galaxy that is vigorously forming stars with UV fields (Log($G$ G$_0^{-1}) \lesssim3.25);$ although less vigorously than local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies or most starbursting submillimeter galaxies in the early universe. Our observations allow new independent estimates of the cold gas mass which indicate $M_\textrm{gas}\sim2\times10^{11}$M$_\odot$, and suggest a modestly larger $\alpha_{\textrm{CO}}$ value of $\sim$8.2. The corresponding gas depletion timescale is $\sim$1.5 Gyr. In addition to gas of modest density (Log($n$ cm$^3)\lesssim3$ ) heated by star formation, BX610 shows evidence for a significant second gas component responsible for the strong high-J CO emission. This second component might either be a high-density molecular gas component heated by star formation in a typical photodissociation region, or could be molecular gas excited by low-velocity C shocks. The CO(7-6)-to-FIR luminosity ratio we observe is significantly higher than typical star-forming galaxies and suggests that CO(7-6) is not a reliable star-formation tracer in this galaxy.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Formation of complex organic molecules in hot molecular cores through nondiffusive grain-surface and ice-mantle chemistry,"A new, more comprehensive model of gas-grain chemistry in hot molecular cores is presented, in which nondiffusive reaction processes on dust-grain surfaces and in ice mantles are implemented alongside traditional diffusive surface/bulk-ice chemistry. We build on our nondiffusive treatments used for chemistry in cold sources, adopting a standard collapse/warm-up physical model for hot cores. A number of other new chemical model inputs and treatments are also explored in depth, culminating in a final model that demonstrates excellent agreement with gas-phase observational abundances for many molecules, including some (e.g. methoxymethanol) that could not be reproduced by conventional diffusive mechanisms. Observed ratios of structural isomers methyl formate, glycolaldehyde and acetic acid are well reproduced by the models. The main temperature regimes are identified in which various complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed. Nondiffusive chemistry advances the production of many COMs to much earlier times and lower temperatures than in previous model implementations. Those species may form either as by-products of simple-ice production, or via early photochemistry within the ices while external UV photons can still penetrate. Cosmic ray-induced photochemistry is less important than in past models, although it affects some species strongly over long timescales. Another production regime occurs during the high-temperature desorption of solid water, whereby radicals trapped in the ice are released onto the grain/ice surface, where they rapidly react. Several recently-proposed gas-phase COM-production mechanisms are also introduced, but they rarely dominate. New surface/ice reactions involving CH and CH$_2$ are found to contribute substantially to the formation of certain COMs.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
icet - A Python library for constructing and sampling alloy cluster expansions,"Alloy cluster expansions (CEs) provide an accurate and computationally efficient mapping of the potential energy surface of multi-component systems that enables comprehensive sampling of the many-dimensional configuration space. Here, we introduce \textsc{icet}, a flexible, extensible, and computationally efficient software package for the construction and sampling of CEs. \textsc{icet} is largely written in Python for easy integration in comprehensive workflows, including first-principles calculations for the generation of reference data and machine learning libraries for training and validation. The package enables training using a variety of linear regression algorithms with and without regularization, Bayesian regression, feature selection, and cross-validation. It also provides complementary functionality for structure enumeration and mapping as well as data management and analysis. Potential applications are illustrated by two examples, including the computation of the phase diagram of a prototypical metallic alloy and the analysis of chemical ordering in an inorganic semiconductor.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Crystal Structure Generation Based on Polyhedra using Dual Periodic Graphs,"Crystal structure design is important for the discovery of new highly functional materials because crystal structure strongly influences material properties. Crystal structures are composed of space-filling polyhedra, which affect material properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant. However, most conventional methods of crystal structure prediction use random structure generation methods that do not take space-filling polyhedra into account, contributing to the inefficiency of materials development. In this work, we propose a crystal structure generation method based on discrete geometric analysis of polyhedra information. In our method, the shape and connectivity of a space-filling polyhedron are represented as a dual periodic graph, and the crystal structure is generated by the standard realization of this graph. We demonstrate that this method can correctly generate face-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and body-centered cubic structures from dual periodic graphs. This work is a first step toward generating undiscovered crystal structures based on the target polyhedra, leading to major advances in materials design in areas including electronics and energy storage.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Nonleptonic two-body weak decays of charmed baryons,"We systematically analyze the two-body nonleptonic weak decays of charmed baryons, employing the pole approximation in tandem with the $SU(3)_F$ symmetry. Leveraging the K\""orner-Patti-Woo theorem, we demonstrate a significant reduction in the number of free parameters. Within the general pole scenario, we successfully explain most of the experimental data of ${\bf B}_c^A \to {\bf B}_nP$, though some inconsistencies are detected and recommended for reexamination in future research. Assuming the dominance of low-lying intermediate baryons, we are able to make novel predictions for decay channels such as $\Omega_c^0 \to {\bf B}_n P$ and ${\bf B}_{cc}\to {\bf B}_c^{A,S} P$. Here, ${\bf B}_n$, ${\bf B}_{c}^A$, ${\bf B}_c^S$ and ${\bf B}_{cc}$ are the low-lying octet, antitriplet charmed, sextet charmed and doubly charmed baryons, respectively, and $P$ is the pseudoscalar meson. Our findings also reveal that the fitted effective Wilson coefficient ${\cal C}_+=0.469$ is notably smaller than the na\""ive expectation, and the low-lying pole scenario fails to account for ${\cal B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to n \pi^+ , \Xi^0 K^+)$ , despite consistencies with the soft meson limit. We further recommend the decay channel $\Xi_{cc}^+ \to \Xi_c^0 \pi^+ \to \Xi^- \pi^+\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$ for exploring evidence of $\Xi_{cc}^+$, estimating the branching fraction at $(1.1\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-3}$. The predictions for nonleptonic weak decay channels are compiled in the appendices, providing valuable references for future experimental validation.",hep,hep-ph,Finite size of hadrons and Bose-Einstein correlations in $pp$ collisions at 7 TeV,"Space-time correlations between produced particles, induced by the composite nature of hadrons, imply specific changes in the properties of the correlation functions for identical particles.

Enhancement of spin relaxation time in hydrogenated graphene spin valve devices,"Hydrogen adsorbates in graphene are interesting as they are not only strong Coulomb scatterers but they also induce a change in orbital hybridization of the carbon network from sp^2 into sp^3. This change increases the spin-orbit coupling and is expected to largely modify spin relaxation. In this work we report the change in spin transport properties of graphene due to plasma hydrogenation. We observe an up to three-fold increase of spin relaxation time tau_S after moderate hydrogen exposure. This increase of tau_S is accompanied by the decrease of charge and spin diffusion coefficients, resulting in a minor change in spin relaxation length lambda_S. At high carrier density we obtain lambda_S of 7 microns, which allows for spin detection over a distance of 11 microns. After hydrogenation a value of tau_S as high as 2.7 ns is measured at room temperature.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Superfluidity of 4He nanoclusters in confinement,"Structure and superfluid response of nanoscale size helium-four clusters enclosed in spherical cavities are studied by computer simulations. The curved surface causes the formation of well-defined concentric shells, thus imparting to the system a very different structure from that of free standing clusters. On a strongly attractive substrate, superfluidity is only observed at low density, in the single layer coating the inner surface of the cavity. If the substrate is very weak (e.g., Li), on the other hand, a superfluid two-shell structure can form, whose physical properties interpolate between two and three dimensions. It is shown how experimental signatures of this physical behavior can be detected through measurements of the momentum distribution.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Locally non-geometric fluxes and missing momenta in M-theory,"We use exceptional field theory to describe locally non-geometric spaces of M-theory of more than three dimensions. For these spaces, we find a new set of locally non-geometric fluxes which lie in the R-R sector in the weak-coupling limit and can typically be characterised by mixed symmetry tensors. These spaces thus provide new examples of non-geometric backgrounds which go beyond the NS-NS sector of string theory. Starting from twisted tori we construct duality chains that lead to these new non-geometric backgrounds and we show that, just as in the four-dimensional case, there are missing momenta associated to the mixed symmetry tensors.",hep,hep-th,Anomalous Cyclic in the Neutrino Oscillations,"Neutrino physics is one of the most important topics in particle physics and cosmology. Despite the many physical properties of neutrinos that are understood theoretically and experimentally, it is known that there are many unsolved problems in this area. In this study, we suppose that the deformed space-time caused by the gravitational perturbation can play an important role in neutrino oscillations. We analytically analyzed these effects on the neutrino oscillation and showed that this effect leads to an anomalous cyclic in the neutrino oscillation. The results clearly indicate that these anomalous cyclics depend on the degree of deformation of space-time. The role of this anomaly in neutrino oscillation may be important. There may be a relation between cyclic anomaly and other anomalies of neutrinos such as mass limits, energy limits, oscillation lengths, mixing angles, and speed of neutrinos. The cyclic anomalies might be detected experimentally. If these anomalies are confirmed, it will appear that we need to think more about neutrino physics.",hep,hep-th,1
Hadronic resonance production and interaction in p-Pb collisions at LHC energies in EPOS3,"Using the EPOS3 model with UrQMD to describe the hadronic phase, we study the production of short-lived hadronic resonances and the modification of their yields and $p_{T}$ spectra in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. High-multiplicity p-Pb collisions exhibit similar behavior to mid-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies, and we find indications of a short-lived hadronic phase in p-Pb collisions that can modify resonance yields and $p_{T}$ spectra through scattering processes. The evolution of resonance production is investigated as a function of the system size, which is related to the lifetime of the hadronic phase, in order to study the onset of collective effects in p-Pb collisions. We also study hadron production separately in the core and corona parts of these collisions, and explore how this division affects the total particle yields as the system size increases.",nucl,nucl-ex,Candidates for the 5$\alpha$ condensed state in ${}^{20}$Ne,"We conducted the coincidence measurement of $\alpha$ particles inelastically scattered from ${}^{20}$Ne at $0^{\circ}$ and decay charged particles in order to search for the alpha-particle condensed state. We compared the measured excitation-energy spectrum and decay branching ratio with the statistical-decay-model calculations, and found that the newly observed states at $E_x$ = 23.6, 21.8, and 21.2 MeV in ${}^{20}$Ne are strongly coupled to a candidate for the 4$\alpha$ condensed state in ${}^{16}$O. This result presents the first strong evidence that these states are the candidates for the 5$\alpha$ condensed state.",nucl,nucl-ex,1

Topological susceptibility, being related to the axial symmetry, have also been calculated and compared with LQCD results to further validate our calculation.",hep,hep-ph,Statistical Error analysis of Nucleon-Nucleon phenomenological potentials,"Nucleon-Nucleon potentials are commonplace in nuclear physics and are determined from a finite number of experimental data with limited precision sampling the scattering process. We study the statistical assumptions implicit in the standard least squares fitting procedure and apply, along with more conventional tests, a tail sensitive quantile-quantile test as a simple and confident tool to verify the normality of residuals. We show that the fulfilment of normality tests is linked to a judicious and consistent selection of a nucleon-nucleon database. These considerations prove crucial to a proper statistical error analysis and uncertainty propagation. We illustrate these issues by analyzing about 8000 proton-proton and neutron-proton scattering published data. This enables the construction of potentials meeting all statistical requirements necessary for statistical uncertainty estimates in nuclear structure calculations.",hep,hep-ph,1
The space of symmetric squares of hyperelliptic curves and integrable Hamiltonian polynomial systems on $\bbbR^4$,"We construct Lie algebras of vector fields on universal bundles $\mathcal{E}^2_{N,0}$ of symmetric squares of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g=1,2,\dots$, where $g=\left[\frac{N-1}{2}\right], \ N=3,4,\ldots$. For each of these Lie algebras, the Lie subalgebra of vertical fields has commuting generators, while the generators of the Lie subalgebra of projectable fields determines the canonical representation of the Lie subalgebra with generators $L_{2q}$, $q=-1, 0, 1, 2, \dots$, of the Witt algebra. We give explicitly a bi-rational equivalence of the space $\mathcal{E}^2_{N,0}$ and $\bbbC^{N+1}$ (in the case $N=5$ it is a well known result of Dubrovin and Novikov) and construct a polynomial Lie algebra on $\bbbC^{N+1}$, which contains two commuting generators. These commuting generators results in two compatible polynomial dynamical systems on $\bbbR^4$, which possess two common polynomial first integrals. Moreover, these systems are Hamiltonian and thus Liouville integrable. Using Abel-Jacobi two point map the solutions of these systems can be given in terms of functions defined on universal covering of the universal bundle of the Jacobians of the curves. These functions are not Abelian if $g\ne 2$. Finally we give explicit solutions of the constructed Hamiltonian systems on $\bbbR^4$ in the cases $N=3,4,5$.",nlin,nlin.SI,Cellular Automata and Ultra-Discrete Painlev\'e Equations,Starting from integrable cellular automata we present a novel form of Painlev\'e equations.

The influence of star formation history on the gravitational wave signal from close double degenerates in the thin disc,"The expected gravitational wave (GW) signal due to double degenerates (DDs) in the thin Galactic disc is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The number of young close DDs that will contribute observable discrete signals in the frequency range $1.58 - 15.8$ mHz is estimated by comparison with the sensitivity of proposed GW observatories. The present-day DD population is examined as a function of Galactic star-formation history alone. It is shown that the frequency distribution, in particular, is a sensitive function of the Galactic star formation history and could be used to measure the time since the last major star-formation epoch.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,OGLE-2016-BLG-1469L: Microlensing Binary Composed of Brown Dwarfs,"We report the discovery of a binary composed of two brown dwarfs, based on the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-1469.

Some consequences of a Higgs triplet,"We consider an extension of the scalar sector of the Standard Model with a single complex Higgs triplet $X$. Such extensions are the most economic, model-independent way of generating neutrino masses through triplet interactions. We show that a term like $\azero\Phi\Phi X^\dag$ must be included in the most general potential of such a scenario, in order to avoid a massless neutral physical scalar. We also demonstrate that $\azero$ must be real, thus ruling out any additional source of CP-violation. We then examine the implications of this term in the mass matrices of the singly-and doubly-charged scalar, neutral scalar and pseudoscalar fields. We find that, for small values of $\azero/\vtwo$, where $\vtwo$ is the triplet vev, the spectrum allows the decay of heavier scalars into lighter ones via gauge interactions. For large $\azero/\vtwo$, the doubly-charged, singly-charged and neutral pseudoscalar bosons become practically degenerate, while the even-parity neutral scalars remain considerably lighter, thus emphasizing the possibility of decay of the singly-charged or neutral pseudoscalar states into the neutral scalars. Constraints from the $\rho$-parameter are used to find nontrivial limits on the charged Higgs mass depending on $\azero$. We also study the couplings of the various physical states in this scenario. For small values of $|\azero|/\vtwo$, we find the lightest neutral scalar field to be triplet-dominated, and thus having extremely suppressed interactions with fermion as well as gauge boson pairs.",hep,hep-ph,Quark-gluon plasma phenomenology from anisotropic lattice QCD,"The FASTSUM collaboration has been carrying out simulations of N_f=2+1 QCD at nonzero temperature in the fixed-scale approach using anisotropic lattices.

A Return To Neutrino Normalcy,Understanding the structure of the fermion mixing matrices is an important question in particle physics. The quark mixing matrix is approximately diagonal while the lepton mixing matrix has large off-diagonal elements. Attempting to understand these structures has been the focus of an large body of literature over the last several decades. In this article we propose a new set of conditions to test the structure of mass matrices called normalcy based on how close to diagonal the mixing matrix is. The mass ordering and the octant of $\theta_{23}$ represent two of these conditions. We point out that the quark matrix easily satisfies all six normalcy conditions while none of them are known to be fully satisfied for leptons at high significance. All of the conditions that can be tested for leptons suggest that the matrix could satisfy the normalcy conditions and upcoming experiments such as DUNE and T2HK will most likely determine if the lepton mass matrix satisfies all of them or not.,hep,hep-ph,Compositeness Condition and Vacuum Stability,"We consider what occurs when we remove one of the compositeness conditions proposed by Bardeen, Hill and Lindner that leads to predictions for the top quark mass conflicting with the experimental value. Through this consideration the condition for the Higgs particle to be the composite particle is reconsidered. We show that in this case, (I) the Higgs-Yukawa system of the standard model becomes equivalent to a non-local four-fermi system at a high-energy scale $\Lambda$, (II) The Higgs-Yukawa sector of the model becomes useless above the scale because the vacuum state cannot be defined. We regard the two phenomena as indications of the compositeness of the Higgs particle. It is suggested that the new physics above $\Lambda$ contains bi-local fields.",hep,hep-ph,1
A versatile method to generate multiple types of micropatterns,"Micropatterning techniques have become an important tool for the study of cell behavior in controlled microenvironments. As a consequence, several approaches for the creation of micropatterns have been developed in recent years. However, the diversity of substrates, coatings and complex patterns used in cell science is so great that no single existing technique is capable of fabricating designs suitable for all experimental conditions. Hence, there is a need for patterning protocols that are flexible with regard to the materials used and compatible with different patterning strategies to create more elaborate setups. In this work, we present a versatile approach to micropatterning. The protocol is based on plasma treatment, protein coating, and a PLL-PEG backfill step, and produces homogeneous patterns on a variety of substrates. Protein density within the patterns can be controlled, and density gradients of surface-bound protein can be formed. Moreover, by combining the method with microcontact printing, it is possible to generate patterns composed of three different components within one iteration of the protocol. The technique is simple to implement and should enable cell science labs to create a broad range of complex and highly specialized microenvironments.",physics,physics.bio-ph,Hydrodynamics and multiscale order in confluent epithelia,"We formulate a hydrodynamic theory of confluent epithelia: i.e. monolayers of epithelial cells adhering to each other without gaps. Taking advantage of recent progresses toward establishing a general hydrodynamic theory of $p-$atic liquid crystals, we demonstrate that collectively migrating epithelia feature both nematic (i.e. $p=2$) and hexatic (i.e. $p=6$) order, with the former being dominant at large and the latter at small length scales. Such a remarkable multiscale liquid crystal order leaves a distinct signature in the system's structure factor, which exhibits two different power law scaling regimes, reflecting both the hexagonal geometry of small cells clusters, as well as the uniaxial structure of the global cellular flow. We support these analytical prediction with two different cell-resolved models of epithelia: i.e. the self-propelled Voronoi model and the multiphase field model, which both confirm existence of multiscale hexanematic order and highlight how different energy dissipation mechanisms affect the structure of the system across length scales.",physics,physics.bio-ph,1
Systematics of dynamic moment of inertia in super-deformed bands in Mass ~150 region,"An empirical semi-classical model have been proposed to investigate the nature of dynamic moment-of-inertia , of the super-deformed (SD) bands in nuclei of mass 150 region. The model incorporates an additional frequency dependent distortion, to the dynamic moment-of-inertia term akin to a vibrational component to explain the extreme spin structure of these bands. Using this model two separate components to the dynamic moment of inertia, $\Im^{(2)}$ have been identified for the SD band structure for the mass 150 region.

Full potential LAPW calculation of electron momentum density and related properties of Li,"Electron momentum density and Compton profiles in Lithium along $<100 >$, $<110>$, and $<111>$ directions are calculated using Full-Potential Linear Augmented Plane Wave basis within generalized gradient approximation. The profiles have been corrected for correlations with Lam-Platzman formulation using self-consistent charge density. The first and second derivatives of Compton profiles are studied to investigate the Fermi surface breaks. Decent agreement is observed between recent experimental and our calculated values. Our values for the derivatives are found to be in better agreement with experiments than earlier theoretical results. Two-photon momentum density and one- and two-dimensional angular correlation of positron annihilation radiation are also calculated within the same formalism and including the electron-positron enhancement factor.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Effective model and pairing tendency in bilayer Ni-based superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$,"Since the discovery of cuprate, the origin of high-T$_c$ superconductivity has been an outstanding puzzle. Recently, high-T$_c$ superconductivity was observed in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, whose structure hosts the apical oxygen between two layers, distinct from multi-layer cuprates. Motivated by this discovery, we investigate its electronic structure using first-principle calculations and superconducting instabilities from both weak-coupling and strong-coupling perspective. Based on the first-principle band structures, we construct a bilayer two-orbital model on a square lattice, consisting of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, which accurately captures the low-energy electronic properties. Within this model, we study pairing instability using both functional renormalization group approach and multi-orbital t-J model. An $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing with sign-reversal gaps on different Fermi surfaces is revealed, reminiscent of iron based superconductors. The Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital and its associated interlayer and intralayer exchange couplings are found to be crucial for the high-T$_c$ superconductivity. Our study provides valuable insights into unique nature of electronic structure and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and contributes to the understanding of unconventional superconductors.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Interpreting Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations with MillenniumTNG: Mass and environment scaling relations,"In the coming years, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) measurements can dramatically improve our understanding of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) and the role of feedback processes on galaxy formation, allowing us to calibrate important astrophysical systematics in cosmological constraints from weak lensing galaxy clustering surveys. However, the signal is only measured in a two-dimensional projection, and its correct interpretation relies on understanding the connection between observable quantities and the underlying intrinsic properties of the gas, in addition to the relation between the gas and the underlying matter distribution. One way to address these challenges is through the use of hydrodynamical simulations such as the high-resolution, large-volume MillenniumTNG suite. We find that measurements of the optical depth, $\tau$, and the Compton-y parameter, $Y$, receive large line-of-sight contributions which can be removed effectively by applying a Compensated Aperture Photometry (CAP) filter. In contrast with other $\tau$ probes (e.g., X-rays and Fast Radio Bursts), the kSZ-inferred $\tau$ receives most of its signal from a confined cylindrical region around the halo due to the velocity decorrelation along the line-of-sight. Additionally, we perform fits to the $Y-M$ and $\tau-M$ scaling relations and report best-fit parameters adopting the smoothly broken power law (SBPL) formalism. We note that subgrid physics modeling can broaden the error bar on these by 30\% for intermediate-mass halos ($\sim$$10^{13} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$). The scatter of the scaling relations can be captured by an intrinsic dependence on concentration, and an extrinsic dependence on tidal shear. Finally, we comment on the effect of using galaxies rather than halos in real observations, which can bias the inferred SZ profiles by $\sim$20\% for $L_\ast$-galaxies.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,From time to timescape - Einstein's unfinished revolution,"I argue that Einstein overlooked an important aspect of the relativity of time in never quite realizing his quest to embody Mach's principle in his theory of gravity. As a step towards that goal, I broaden the Strong Equivalence Principle to a new principle of physics, the Cosmological Equivalence Principle, to account for the role of the evolving average regional density of the universe in the synchronisation of clocks and the relative calibration of inertial frames. In a universe dominated by voids of the size observed in large-scale structure surveys, the density contrasts of expanding regions are strong enough that a relative deceleration of the background between voids and the environment of galaxies, typically of order 10^{-10} m/s^2, must be accounted for. As a result one finds a universe whose present age varies by billions of years according to the position of the observer: a timescape. This model universe is observationally viable: it passes three critical independent tests, and makes additional predictions. Dark energy is revealed as a mis-identification of gravitational energy gradients and the resulting variance in clock rates. Understanding the biggest mystery in cosmology therefore involves a paradigm shift, but in an unexpected direction: the conceptual understanding of time and energy in Einstein's own theory is incomplete.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Bounds on quantum confinement effects in metal nanoparticles,"Quantum size effects on the permittivity of metal nanoparticles are investigated using the quantum box model. Explicit upper and lower bounds are derived for the permittivity and relaxation rates due to quantum confinement effects. These bounds are verified numerically, and the size-dependence and frequency-dependence of the empirical Drude size parameter is extracted from the model. Results suggest that the common practice of empirically modifying the dielectric function can lead to inaccurate predictions for highly uniform distributions of finite-sized particles.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Effects of phosphorus-doping upon the electronic structures of single wall carbon nanotubes,"The phosphorus-doped single wall carbon nanotube (PSWCNT) is studied by using First-Principle methods based on Density Function Theory (DFT). The formation energy, total energy, band structure, geometry structure and density of states are calculated. It is found that the formation energy of the P-doped single carbon nanotubes increases with diameters; the total energy of carbon nanotubes with the same diameter decreases as the doping rate increases. The effects of impurity position on the im-purity level are discussed. It illustrates that the position of the impurity level may depend on the C-P-C bond angle. According to the above results, it is feasible to substitute a carbon atom with a phosphorus atom in SWCNT. It is also found that P-doped carbon nanotubes are N type semiconductor.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Giant thermal magnetoresistance in plasmonic structures,"A giant thermal magnetoresistance is predicted for the electromagnetic transport of heat in magneto-optical plasmonic structures. In chains of InSb-Ag nanoparticles at room temperature, we found that the resistance can be increased by almost a factor of 2 with magnetic fields of 2 T. We show that this important change results from the strong spectral dependence of localized surface waves on the magnitude of the magnetic field.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Investigating transverse Hall conductances using two-terminal setups,"In this paper we present a method to numerically study transverse Hall conductances using a two-terminal setup. Using nonlinear transport concepts we find that the Hall voltage dependence on the model parameters can be investigated from the difference between the injectivities from each terminal. The method is suitable to work with non-equilibrium Green's functions as well as for scattering matrix approaches. We illustrate the proposed idea by studying the quantum spin Hall effect in graphene with disordered spin-orbit scattering centers induced by adatoms. We use two distinct models, a finite difference implementation of the Dirac Hamiltonian and a tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with the scattering matrix approach and the non-equilibrium Green's functions approach, respectively.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Influence of the projectile description on breakup calculations,"Calculations of the breakup of 8B and 11Be are performed with the aim of analyzing their sensitivity to the projectile description. Several potentials adjusted on the same experimental data are used for each projectile. The results vary significantly with the potential choice, and this sensitivity differs from one projectile to the other. In the 8B case, the breakup cross section is approximately scaled by the asymptotic normalization coefficient of the initial bound state (ANC). For $^{11}$Be, the overall normalization of the breakup cross section is no longer solely determined by the ANC. The partial waves describing the continuum are found to play a significant role in this variation, as the sensitivity of the phase shifts to the projectile description changes with the physical constraints imposed to the potential.",nucl,nucl-th,"Contributions of $2\pi$-exchange, $1\pi$-exchange, and contact three-body forces in NNLO ChEFT to $_\Lambda^3$H","Faddeev calculations of hypertriton ($_\Lambda^3$H) separation energy are performed, incorporating all next-to-next-to-leading-order $\Lambda$NN three-body forces (3BFs) in chiral effective field theory: $2\pi$-exchange, $1\pi$-exchange, and contact interactions. The $1\pi$-exchange and contact interactions are rewritten in a form suitable for evaluating partial-wave matrix elements. The $\Lambda$-deuteron folding potentials constructed from these 3BFs are evaluated to demonstrate their contributions to \h3t. The $1\pi$-exchange interaction provides an attractive effect in which the d-state component of the deuteron wave function plays an important role. The attractive contribution tends to cancel the repulsive ones from the $2\pi$-exchange and contact 3BFs. Faddeev calculations show that the net effect of the 3BFs to the \h3t separation energy is small in a range between $-5$ to $+20$ keV, depending on the NN interaction used. Although these results are based on speculative low-energy constants, they can serve as a reference for further investigations.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Spontaneous Formation of Double Emulsions at Particle-Laden Interfaces,"Double emulsions, due to their compartmental structures, are essential in food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical applications. Traditionally, double emulsifications rely on the presence of both oil-soluble and water-soluble surfactants or external stimuli responsive materials and require sequential droplet formation settings or unique fluidic designs. We report on unusual phenomenon where double emulsions are spontaneously formed as soon an aqueous nanoparticle dispersion is placed in contact with an oleic micellar solution. Nanoscale water droplets nucleate in oil in the form of swollen micelles. Nanoparticles form a water-shell encapsulating the saturated oil phase with swollen micelles over time. Remarkably, we find that the gradual surface-activation of nanoparticles is key in self-double emulsification and controlling the emulsion intensity. We build on this new discovery and design a novel system for double emulsion formation. This approach is a scalable self-sequential strategy for preparing core-shell double emulsions that disperses nanoparticles in the opposite phase by employing micelles as transport vehicles. Incorporating nanoparticles into spontaneous emulsification systems opens novel routes for designing emulsion-based materials.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Single-bubble and multi-bubble cavitation in water triggered by laser-driven focusing shock waves,"In this study a single laser pulse spatially shaped into a ring is focused into a thin water layer, creating an annular cavitation bubble and cylindrical shock waves: an outer shock that diverges away from the excitation laser ring and an inner shock that focuses towards the center. A few nanoseconds after the converging shock reaches the focus and diverges away from the center, a single bubble nucleates at the center. The inner diverging shock then reaches the surface of the annular laser-induced bubble and reflects at the boundary, initiating nucleation of a tertiary bubble cloud. In the present experiments, we have performed time-resolved imaging of shock propagation and bubble wall motion. Our experimental observations of single-bubble cavitation and collapse and appearance of ring-shaped bubble clouds are consistent with our numerical simulations that solve a one dimensional Euler equation in cylindrical coordinates. The numerical results agree qualitatively with the experimental observations of the appearance and growth of bubble clouds at the smallest laser excitation rings. Our technique of shock-driven bubble cavitation opens novel perspectives for the investigation of shock-induced single-bubble or multi-bubble cavitation phenomena in thin liquids.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Finite volume treatment of $\pi\pi$ scattering in the $\rho$ channel,"We make a theoretical study of $\pi\pi$ scattering with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ in a finite box. To calculate physical observables for infinite volume from lattice QCD, the finite box dependence of the potentials is not usually considered. We quantify such effects by means of two different approaches for vector-isovector $\pi\pi$ scattering based on Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory results: the Inverse Amplitude Method and another one based on the $N/D$ method. We take into account finite box effects stemming from higher orders through loops in the crossed $t,u-$channels as well as from the renormalization of the coupling constants. The main conclusion is that for $\pi\pi$ phase shifts in the isovector channel one can safely apply L\""uscher based methods for finite box sizes of $L$ greater than $2 m_\pi^{-1}$.",hep,hep-lat,Quark propagator with two flavors of O(a)-improved Wilson fermions,"We compute the Landau gauge quark propagator from lattice QCD with two flavors of dynamical O(a)-improved Wilson fermions. The calculation is carried out with lattice spacings ranging from 0.06 fm to 0.08 fm, with quark masses corresponding to pion masses of 420, 290 and 150 MeV, and for volumes of up to (4.5fm)^4. Our ensembles allow us to evaluate lattice spacing, volume and quark mass effects. We find that the quark wave function which is suppressed in the infrared, is further suppressed as the quark mass is reduced, but the suppression is weakened as the volume is increased. The quark mass function M(p^2) shows only a weak volume dependence. Hypercubic artefacts beyond O(a) are reduced by applying both cylinder cuts and H4 extrapolations. The H4 extrapolation shifts the quark wave function systematically upwards but does not perform well for the mass function.",hep,hep-lat,1
Comparative High Field Magneto-Transport of Rare Earth Oxypnictides with Maximum Transition Temperatures,"The recent discovery of a new class of superconducting oxypnictides with high transition temperatures may have profound implications for understanding unconventional high-temperature superconductivity. Like the cuprates, the oxypnictides seem to manifest an interleaving of charge donor and superconducting layers emerging upon doping of an antiferromagnetic parent semi-metal. Here we report magneto-transport measurements of three rare earth (Re = La, Nd, Sm) oxypnicide compounds with the transition temperatures near the maximum reported to date, in very high DC and pulsed magnetic fields up to 45 and 54 T, respectively. Our resistivity, Hall coefficient and critical magnetic fields data suggest that these oxypnictide superconductors bridge the gap between MgB$_2$ and YBaCu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ as far as electromagnetic and vortex properties are concerned.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Scaling between magnetic and lattice fluctuations in iron-pnictide superconductors,"The phase diagram of the iron arsenides is dominated by a magnetic and a structural phase transition, which need to be suppressed in order for superconductivity to appear.

Here, we find a scaling relation between nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and shear modulus data in the tetragonal phase of electron-doped $\mathrm{Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}}$ compounds. Because the former probes the strength of magnetic fluctuations while the latter is sensitive to orthorhombic fluctuations, our results provide strong evidence for a magnetically-driven structural transition.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Wide Field Imaging of van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 by Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride,"Emergent color centers with accessible spins hosted by van der Waals materials have attracted substantial interest in recent years due to their significant potential for implementing transformative quantum sensing technologies. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is naturally relevant in this context due to its remarkable ease of integration into devices consisting of low-dimensional materials. Taking advantage of boron vacancy spin defects in hBN, we report nanoscale quantum imaging of low-dimensional ferromagnetism sustained in Fe3GeTe2/hBN van der Waals heterostructures. Exploiting spin relaxometry methods, we have further observed spatially varying magnetic fluctuations in the exfoliated Fe3GeTe2 flake, whose magnitude reaches a peak value around the Curie temperature. Our results demonstrate the capability of spin defects in hBN of investigating local magnetic properties of layered materials in an accessible and precise way, which can be extended readily to a broad range of miniaturized van der Waals heterostructure systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Experimental realization of a silicon spin field-effect transistor,"A longitudinal electric field is used to control the transit time (through an undoped silicon vertical channel) of spin-polarized electrons precessing in a perpendicular magnetic field.

Universal R-Matrix of Reductive Lie Algebras,"The aim of the paper is to build a universal R-matrix for the multiparameter deformation of any reductive Lie algebra. Such deformations, formulated in the recent past by Truini and Varadarajan, have the property of universality in a certain class and are shown by the present paper to be quasitriangular Hopf algebras. In order to build the R-matrix we exploit the twisting method for introducing new parameters as well as for making the transition to the reductive case. The physical motivation behind this construction is in the theory of integrable models: we intend to use such R-matrix for building the associated quantum R-matrix and Lax operators with spectral as well as color parameters - the color parameters being provided by the eigenvalues of the central generators of the reductive Lie algebra in a given representation. In this letter we present only the explicit form of the universal R-matrix of reductive Lie algebras and postpone its application to a forthcoming paper.",hep,hep-th,Marginal Deformations of N=4 SYM from Open/Closed Twistor Strings,"We investigate how the marginal deformations of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (analysed in particular by Leigh and Strassler) arise within B-model topological string theory on supertwistor space CP(3|4). This is achieved by turning on a certain closed string background in the fermionic directions. Through a specific open/closed correlation function, this mode induces a correction to holomorphic Chern-Simons theory, corresponding to the self-dual part of the chiral operator added on the gauge theory side. The effect of the deformation is interpreted as non-anticommutativity between some of the odd coordinates of CP(3|4). Motivated by this, we extend the twistor formalism for calculating MHV amplitudes in N=4 SYM to these N=1 theories by introducing a suitable star product between the wavefunctions. We check that our prescription yields the expected results to linear order in the deformation parameter.",hep,hep-th,1
"Goos-H\""{a}nchen Shifts of Partially Coherent Light Fields","We investigate the Goos-H\""{a}nchen (GH) shifts of partially coherent fields (PCFs) by using the theory of coherence. We derive a formal expression for the GH shifts of PCFs in terms of Mercer's expansion, and then clearly demonstrate the dependence of the GH shift of each mode of PCFs on spatial coherence and beam width. We discuss the effect of spatial coherence on the resultant GH shifts, especially for the cases near the critical angles, such as totally reflection angle.",physics,physics.optics,Polarisation and Transparency of Relativistically Rotating Two-Level Atoms,"Electromagnetism and light-matter interaction in rotating systems is a rich area of ongoing research. We study the interaction of light with a gas of non-interacting two-level atoms confined to a rotating disk. We numerically solve the optical Bloch equations to investigate the how relativistic rotation affects the atoms' polarisation and inversion. The results are used to predict the steady-state stimulated emission seen by an observer at rest with the optical source in the laboratory frame. Competing physical effects due to time dilation and motion-induced detuning strongly modify solutions to the Bloch equations when the gas's velocity becomes relativistic. We account for the non-inertial motion by including acceleration-dependent excitation and emission rates, arising from a generalised Unruh effect. The effective thermal vacuum resulting from large accelerations de-polarises the gas while driving it towards population inversion, negating coherent driving due to the external light source. The results illustrate the intuitive, special-relativistic approach of assigning instantaneously comoving frames to understand non-inertial motion's influence when only local fields are physically significant.",physics,physics.optics,1
Cosmological Parameter Estimation Using the Genus Amplitude - Application to Mock Galaxy Catalogs,"We study the topology of the matter density field in two dimensional slices, and consider how we can use the amplitude $A$ of the genus for cosmological parameter estimation. Using the latest Horizon Run 4 simulation data, we calculate the genus of the smoothed density field constructed from lightcone mock galaxy catalogs. Information can be extracted from the amplitude of the genus by considering both its redshift evolution and magnitude. The constancy of the genus amplitude with redshift can be used as a standard population, from which we derive constraints on the equation of state of dark energy $w_{\rm de}$ - by measuring $A$ at $z \sim 0.1$ and $z \sim 1$, we can place an order $\Delta w_{\rm de} \sim {\cal O}(15\%)$ constraint on $w_{\rm de}$. By comparing $A$ to its Gaussian expectation value we can potentially derive an additional stringent constraint on the matter density $\Delta \Omega_{\rm mat} \sim 0.01$. We discuss the primary sources of contamination associated with the two measurements - redshift space distortion and shot noise. With accurate knowledge of galaxy bias, we can successfully remove the effect of redshift space distortion, and the combined effect of shot noise and non-linear gravitational evolution is suppressed by smoothing over suitably large scales $R_{\rm G} \ge 15 {\rm Mpc}/h$. Without knowledge of the bias, we discuss how joint measurements of the two and three dimensional genus can be used to constrain the growth factor $\beta = f/b$. The method can be applied optimally to redshift slices of a galaxy distribution generated using the drop-off technique.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Power-spectrum simulations of radial redshift distributions,"On the base of the simplest model of a modulation of 3D Gaussian field in $k$-space we produce a set of simulations to bring out the effects of a modulating function $f_{\rm mod} (k)=f_1 (k) + f_2 (k)$ on power spectra of radial (shell-like) distributions of cosmological objects, where a model function $f_1 (k)$ reproduces the smoothed power spectrum of underlying 3D density fluctuations, while $f_2 (k)$ is a wiggling function imitating the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). It is shown that some excess of realizations of simulated radial distributions actually displays quasi-periodical components with periods about a characteristic scale $2\pi/k \sim 100~h^{-1}$~Mpc detected as power-spectrum peaks in vicinity of the first maximum of the modulation function $f_2 (k)$. We revised our previous estimations of the significance of such peaks and found that they were largely overestimated. Thereby quasi-periodical components appearing in some radial distributions of matter are likely to be stochastic (rather than determinative), while the amplitudes of the respective spectral peaks can be quite noticeable. They are partly enhanced by smooth part of the modulating function $f_1(k)$ and, to a far lesser extent, by effects of the BAO (i.e. $f_2(k)$). The results of the simulations match quite well with statistical properties of the radial distributions of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs).",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Photoproduction of the charged charmoniumlike $Z_{c}^{+}(4200)$,"In this work, inspired by the observation of charmoniumlike $Z_{c}^{+}(4200)$% , we study the photoproduction of charged charmoniumlike $Z_{c}^{+}(4200)$ with an effective Lagrangian approach and the Regge trajectories model. The numerical results indicate that the Reggeized treatment can lead to a lower total cross section of the $Z_{c}^{+}(4200)$ photoproduction and the peak position of cross section was moved to the higher energy point when the Reggeized treatment was added. {Moreover, using the data from the COMPASS experiment and presented theoretical predictions, an upper limit of the decay width of $Z_{c}(4200)\rightarrow J/\psi \pi $ is estimated.} The relevant results not only shed light on the further experiment of searching for the charmoniumlike $Z_{c}(4200)$ state via meson photoproduction, but also provide valuable informations for having a better comprehension of the nature of charmoniumlike $Z_{c}(4200)$ state.",hep,hep-ph,Theory of hard probes in PbPb collisions,"The jet quenching phenomenon in heavy ion collisions provides a strong evidence of the modification of parton shower in the quark-gluon plasma.

We emphasize the important role of jet substructure observables as they probe various aspects of the jet formation mechanism and allow us to study the medium properties in great details. The precise calculations require the systematic resummation and consistently including medium modifications. Specifically, we discuss the calculations of jet shapes and cross sections in proton-proton and lead-lead collisions at the LHC using soft-collinear effective theory, with Glauber gluon interactions in the medium.

Insights into the Unusual Semiconducting Behavior in Low-Dimensional Boron,"Elementary semiconductors are rare and attractive, especially for low-dimensional materials. Unfortunately, most of boron nanostructures were found to be metallic, despite of their typical semiconducting bulk structure. Herein, we propose a general recipe to realize low-dimensional semiconducting boron. This unusual semiconducting behavior is attributed to charge transfer and electron localization, induced by the symmetry breaking that divides boron atoms into cations and anions. In addition, it is feasible to accomplish band gap engineering by rationally designing various structures. Importantly, the low-dimensional semiconducting boron are predicted to be an excellent solar-cell material with the power conversion efficiency of higher than 20%, paving the way for their promising optoelectronic applications.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Superconducting Fluctuation Corrections to the Thermal Current in Granular Metals,"The first-order superconducting fluctuation corrections to the thermal conductivity of a granular metal are calculated.

It is found that in the resonant-absorption condition, the major term associated with the laboratory velocity is a dot-product term between this velocity and that of the emitting or absorbing atom. This term appears both in the Doppler frequency shift and the transition frequency variation and then cancels out. Thereby, the experimental results can be independent of the laboratory velocity and hence comply with Galilean relativity, despite the restriction that the involved velocities are referred specifically to the local-ether frame. However, by examining the resonant-absorption condition in the M\""{o}ssbauer rotor experiment to a higher order, it is found that Galilean relativity breaks down.",physics,physics.gen-ph,1
Thermodynamic Behavior of Friedmann Equation at Apparent Horizon of FRW Universe,"It is shown that the differential form of Friedmann equation of a FRW universe can be rewritten as a universal form $dE = TdS + WdV$ at apparent horizon, where $E$ and $V$ are the matter energy and volume inside the apparent horizon (the energy $E$ is the same as the Misner-Sharp energy in the case of Einstein general relativity), $W=(\rho-P)/2$ is the work density and $\rho$ and $P$ are energy density and pressure of the matter in the universe, respectively. From the thermodynamic identity one can derive that the apparent horizon has associated entropy $S= A/4G$ and temperature $T = \kappa / 2\pi$ in Einstein general relativity, where $A$ is the area of apparent horizon and $\kappa$ is the surface gravity at apparent horizon. We extend our procedure to the Gauss-Bonnet gravity and more general Lovelock gravity and show that the differential form of Friedmann equations in these gravities can also be rewritten to thee universal form $dE = TdS + WdV$ at the apparent horizon with entropy $S$ being given by expression previously known via black hole thermodynamics.",hep,hep-th,Renormalization group irreversible functions in more than two dimensions,"There are two general irreversibility theorems for the renormalization group in more than two dimensions: the first one is of entropic nature, while the second one, by Forte and Latorre, relies on the properties of the stress-tensor trace, and has been recently questioned by Osborn and Shore. We start by establishing under what assumptions this second theorem can still be valid. Then it is compared with the entropic theorem and shown to be essentially equivalent. However, since the irreversible function of the (corrected) Forte-Latorre theorem is non universal (whereas the relative entropy of the other theorem is universal), it needs the additional step of renormalization. On the other hand, the irreversibility theorem is only guaranteed to be unambiguous if the integral of the stress-tensor trace correlator is finite, which happens for free theories only in dimension smaller than four.",hep,hep-th,1
Coherence Effects in Charmonium Production off Nuclei : Consequences for J/\psi Suppression,"The probabilistic Glauber formula for nuclear absorption used in the literature is only valid at low energies and $x_+ \simeq 0$. Due to energy conservation, $\sigma_{abs}$ is replaced by an effective cross-section $\sigma_{abs} + x_+^{\gamma}$ ($\sigma_{c\bar{c}-N} - \sigma_{abs})$ which increases with $x_+$ and tends to the total $c\bar{c}-N$ cross-section $\sigma_{c\bar{c}-N}$. Experimental data can be described with $\sigma_{abs} \sim 4 \div 5$mb and $\sigma_{c\bar{c}-N} \sim 15 \div 20$mb. At high energies, due to the increase of the coherence length, this formula changes. The main change is the replacement of $\sigma_{abs}$ by $\sigma_{c\bar{c}-N}$ -- for all values of $x_+$, as $s \to \infty$. Thus, if $\sigma_{c\bar{c}-N} > \sigma_{abs}$ the $J/\psi$ suppression due to nuclear interaction will increase with energy.",nucl,nucl-th,"On ""the authentic damping mechanism"" of the phonon damping model",Some general features of the phonon damping model are presented.

Prospecting for the superfluid transition in electron-hole coupled quantum wells using Coulomb drag,"I investigate the possibility of using Coulomb drag to detect a precursor of the predicted (but as yet not definitively observed) superfluid transition in electron-hole coupled quantum wells. The drag transresisitivity $\rho_{21}$ is shown to be significantly enhanced above the transition temperature $T_c$ and to diverge logarithmically as $T\to T_c^+$, due to electron-hole pairing fluctuations which are somewhat analogous to the Maki-Thompson contribution to conductivity in metals above the superconducting $T_c$. The enhancement in $\rho_{21}$ is estimated to be detectable at temperatures much higher than $T_c$.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,"Comment on ""Validity of Einstein Relation in Disordered Organic Semiconductors""","Wetzelaer, Koster, and Blom [PRL 107, 066605] recently observed that the classic Einstein relation $\frac{D}{\mu}=\frac{kT}{q}$ is still valid in disordered semiconductors in thermal(quasi)equilibrium by studying the diffusion-driven currents of single-carrier diodes. This is in contrast to the previous theoretical prediction [2] and experiment observation from Leo et.al. [3] where the Einstein relation increases with 1/T. We will discuss the reason for this discrepancy here and suggest that one-carrier diodes experiment might nor be suitable for verifying Einstein relation in organic semiconductors.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Quark Confinement and Surface Critical Phenomena,Surface critical phenomena and the related onset of Goldstone modes probe the fundamental properties of the confining flux in Quantum Chromodynamics. New ideas on surface roughening and their implications for lattice studies of quark confinement are presented. Problems with the oversimplified string description of the Wilson flux sheet are discussed.,hep,hep-lat,Three-dimensional super-Yang--Mills theory on the lattice and dual black branes,"In the large-$N$ and strong-coupling limit, maximally supersymmetric SU($N$) Yang--Mills theory in $(2 + 1)$ dimensions is conjectured to be dual to the decoupling limit of a stack of $N$ D$2$-branes, which may be described by IIA supergravity.We study this conjecture in the Euclidean setting using nonperturbative lattice gauge theory calculations.Our supersymmetric lattice construction naturally puts the theory on a skewed Euclidean 3-torus. Taking one cycle to have anti-periodic fermion boundary conditions, the large-torus limit is described by certain Euclidean black holes. We compute the bosonic action---the variation of the partition function---and compare our numerical results to the supergravity prediction as the size of the torus is changed, keeping its shape fixed. Our lattice calculations primarily utilize $N = 8$ with extrapolations to the continuum limit, and our results are consistent with the expected gravity behavior in the appropriate large-torus limit.",hep,hep-lat,1
Thermodynamic interpretation of the de Sitter swampland conjecture,"We interpret the de Sitter swampland conjecture in the thermodynamic point of view. When the number of degrees of freedom is enhanced as the modulus rolls down the potential, the bound on $m_{\rm Pl} \nabla V/V$ is equivalent to the condition for the positive temperature phase. The boundary between the positive- and the negative temperature phases is preferred by the classical system since the entropy density is maximized. The distance conjecture imposes that (quasi-)de Sitter spacetime is entirely in the negative temperature phase and statistically disfavored. By investigating the concave potential, we also justify the bound on $m_{\rm Pl}^2 \nabla^2 V/V$.",hep,hep-th,Open Wilson Lines in Noncommutative Gauge Theory and Tomography of Holographic Dual Supergravity,"We study the issue of gauge-invariant observables in d=4, N=4 noncommutative gauge theory and UV-IR relation therein. We show that open Wilson lines form a complete set of gauge invariant operators, which are local in momentum space and, depending on their size, exhibit two distinct behaviors of the UV-IR relation. We next study these properties in a proposed dual description in terms of supergravity and find agreement.",hep,hep-th,1
BLACK HOLE MULTIPLETS AND SPONTANEOUS BREAKING OF LOCAL SUPERSYMMETRY,"We classify states saturating a double or a single supersymmetric positivity bound of a four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetry. The massive four-dimensional double-bound states (Bogomolny states) are shown to form a light-like representation of ten-dimensional supersymmetry. The single-bound states form a massive representation (centrino multiplet) of a four-dimensional supersymmetry. The first component of the centrino multiplet is identified with extreme black holes with regular horizon which have one quarter of unbroken supersymmetry. The centrino multiplet includes a massive spin 3/2 state, the centrino, as a highest spin state. Existence of massive black hole supermultiplets may affect the massless sector of the theory. Assuming that gluino condensate is formed one can study its properties. The bilinear combination of covariantly constant Killing spinors supplies the possible form for a gluino condensate. The condensate has null properties, does not introduce a cosmological constant, and may lead to a spontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry. This suggests that centrino may provide a consistent super-Higgs mechanism.",hep,hep-th,Recipes for Oscillon Longevity,"Oscillons are localized states of scalar fields sustained by self interactions. They decay by emitting classical radiation, but their lifetimes are surprisingly large. We revisit the reasons behind their longevity, aiming at how the shape of the scalar potential $V(\phi)$ determines the lifetime. The corpuscular picture, where the oscillon is identified with a bound state of a large number of field quanta, allows to understand lifetimes of order of $10^3$ cycles in generic potentials. At the non-perturbative level, two properties of the scalar potential can substantially boost the lifetime: the flattening of $V(\phi)$ and the positivity of $V''(\phi)$. These properties are realized in the axion monodromy family of potentials. Moreover, this class of models connects continuously with an exceptional potential that admits eternal oscillon solutions. We check these results with a new fast-forward numerical method that allows to evolve in time to stages that cannot be otherwise simulated on a computer. The method exploits the attractor properties of the oscillons and fully accounts for nonlinearities. We find lifetimes up to $10^{14}$ cycles, but larger values are possible. Our work shows that oscillons formed in the early Universe can be stable on cosmological time scales and thus contribute to the abundance of (ultra)light scalar dark matter.",hep,hep-th,1
Study of noise impact on nonlinear frequency division multiplexing,"In this work, how the noise contaminates signals propagating in an optical fibre is discussed in the nonlinear spectral domain after applying the nonlinear Fourier transform. Simulation results about how the soliton parameters in the nonlinear spectral domain perturb is shown.",physics,physics.optics,Analytical solution for wave propagation through a graded index interface between a right-handed and a left-handed material,"We have investigated the transmission and reflection properties of structures incorporating left-handed materials with graded index of refraction. We present an exact analytical solution to Helmholtz' equation for a graded index profile changing according to a hyperbolic tangent function along the propagation direction. We derive expressions for the field intensity along the graded index structure, and we show excellent agreement between the analytical solution and the corresponding results obtained by accurate numerical simulations. Our model straightforwardly allows for arbitrary spectral dispersion.",physics,physics.optics,1
"Glauber-model analysis of total reaction cross sections for Ne, Mg, Si, and S isotopes with Skyrme-Hartree-Fock densities","A systematic analysis is made on the total reaction cross sections for Ne, Mg, Si, and S isotopes. The high-energy nucleus-nucleus collision is described based on the Glauber model. Using the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method in the three-dimensional grid-space representation, we determine the nuclear density distribution for a wide range of nuclei self-consistently without assuming any spatial symmetry. The calculated total reaction cross sections consistently agree with the recent cross section data on Ne$+^{12}$C collision at 240$A$\,MeV, which makes it possible to discuss the radius and deformation of the isotopes. The total reaction cross sections for Mg$+^{12}$C, Si$+^{12}$C and S$+^{12}$C cases are predicted for future measurements. We also find that the high-energy cross section data for O, Ne, and Mg isotopes on a $^{12}$C target at around 1000\,$A$MeV can not be reproduced consistently with the corresponding data at 240\,$A$MeV.",nucl,nucl-th,Collective longitudinal polarization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at very high energy,"We study the polarization of particles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at very high energy along the beam direction within a relativistic hydrodynamic framework. We show that this component of the polarization decreases much slower with center-of-mass energy compared to the transverse component, even in the ideal longitudinal boost-invariant scenario with non-fluctuating initial state, and that it can be measured by taking advantage of its quadrupole structure in the transverse momentum plane. In the ideal longitudinal boost-invariant scenario, the polarization is proportional to the gradient of temperature at the hadronization and its measurement can provide important information about the cooling rate of the Quark Gluon Plasma around the critical temperature.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Analyzing epsilon'/epsilon in the 1/N_c Expansion,"We present a recent analysis of epsilon'/epsilon in the 1/N_c expansion. We show that the 1/N_c corrections to the matrix element of Q_6 are large and positive, indicating a Delta I=1/2 enhancement similar to the one of Q_1 and Q_2 which dominate the CP conserving amplitude. This enhances the CP ratio and can bring the standard model prediction close to the measured value for central values of the parameters.",hep,hep-ph,Relation between the pole and the minimally subtracted mass in dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction to three-loop order,We compute the relation between the pole quark mass and the minimally subtracted quark mass in the framework of QCD applying dimensional reduction as a regularization scheme. Special emphasis is put on the evanescent couplings and the renormalization of the epsilon-scalar mass. As a by-product we obtain the three-loop on-shell renormalization constants Zm(OS) and Z2(OS) in dimensional regularization and thus provide the first independent check of the analytical results computed several years ago.,hep,hep-ph,1
The SAMI Galaxy Survey: impact of black hole activity on galaxy spin-filament alignments,"The activity of central supermassive black holes might affect the alignment of galaxy spin axes with respect to the closest cosmic filaments. We exploit the SAMI Galaxy Survey to study possible relations between black hole activity and the spin-filament alignments of stars and ionised gas separately. To explore the impact of instantaneous black hole activity, active galaxies are selected according to emission-line diagnostics. Central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_c$) is used as a proxy for black hole mass and its integrated activity. We find evidence for the gas spin-filament alignments to be influenced by AGN, with Seyfert galaxies showing a stronger perpendicular alignment at fixed bulge mass with respect to galaxies where ionisation is consequence of low-ionizaition nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) or old stellar populations (retired galaxies). On the other hand, the greater perpendicular tendency for the stellar spin-filament alignments of high-bulge mass galaxies is dominated by retired galaxies. Stellar alignments show a stronger correlation with $\sigma_c$ compared to the gas alignments. We confirm that bulge mass ($M_{bulge}$) is the primary parameter of correlation for both stellar and gas spin-filament alignments (with no residual dependency left for $\sigma_c$), while $\sigma_c$ is the most important property for secular star formation quenching (with no residual dependency left for $M_{bulge}$). These findings indicate that $M_{bulge}$ and $\sigma_c$ are the most predictive parameters of two different galaxy evolution processes, suggesting mergers trigger spin-filament alignment flips and integrated black hole activity drives star formation quenching.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Discovery of a Low-Redshift Damped Ly$\alpha$ System in a Foreground Extended Disk Using a Starburst Galaxy Background Illuminator,"We present the discovery of a low-redshift damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) system in the spectrum of background starburst galaxy SDSS J111323.88+293039.3 ($z=0.17514$). The DLA is at an impact parameter of $\rm \rho=36~kpc$ from the star forming galaxy, SDSS J111324.08+293051.2 ($z=0.17077$). We measure an HI column density of $N($HI$)\rm =3.47\times10^{20}~cm^{-2}$ along with multiple low-ionization species such as NI, NII, SiII, CII, and SiIII. We also make an estimate of the covering fraction to be 0.883, giving us a limiting size of the DLA to be $A_{DLA}\rm \geq3.3~kpc^2$. Assuming a uniform column density over the entire DLA system, we estimate its mass to be $M_{DLA}\geq5.3\times 10^6~M_\odot$. The extended illuminator and the low redshift of this DLA give us the unique opportunity to characterize its nature and the connection to its host galaxy. We measure a velocity offset of +131 km s$^{-1}$ from the systemic velocity of the host for the DLA. This velocity is $-84$ km s$^{-1}$ from the projected rotation velocity of the host galaxy as measured using a newly constructed rotation curve. Based on the size of the host galaxy, the HI column density, and the gas kinematics, we believe this DLA is tracing the warm neutral gas in the HI disk of the foreground galaxy. Our detection adds to a small set of low-redshift DLAs that have confirmed host galaxies, and is the first to be found using an extended background source.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Universal quark to gluon ratio in medium-induced parton cascade,"We investigate the radiative break-up of a highly energetic quark or gluon in a high-temperature QCD plasma. Within an inertial range of momenta $T \ll \omega \ll E$, where $E$ denotes the energy of the original hard parton (jet) and $T$ the temperature of of the medium, we find that, as a result of the turbulent nature of the underlying parton cascade, the quark to gluon ratio of the soft fragments tends to a universal constant value that is independent of the initial conditions. We discuss implications of this result to jet quenching physics and the problem of thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions.",hep,hep-ph,Phase Transitions in the Early Universe (Is there a Strongly First Order Electroweak Phase Transition?),"After some introductory remarks about the prospects of first order phase transitions in the early universe, we discuss in some detail the electroweak phase transition. In the standard model case a clear picture is arising including perturbative and nonperturbative effects. Since in this case the phase transition is not strongly first order as needed for baryogenesis, we discuss supersymmetric variants of the standard model, the MSSM with a light stop$_R$ and a NMSSM model where this can be achieved. We conclude with some remarks about the technical procedure and about possible effects of a strongly first order electroweak phase transition including baryogenesis.",hep,hep-ph,1
Learning the Alpha-bits of Black Holes,"When the bulk geometry in AdS/CFT contains a black hole, the boundary reconstruction of a given bulk operator will often necessarily depend on the choice of black hole microstate, an example of state dependence. As a result, whether a given bulk operator can be reconstructed on the boundary at all can depend on whether the black hole is described by a pure state or thermal ensemble. We refine this dichotomy, demonstrating that the same boundary operator can often be used for large subspaces of black hole microstates, corresponding to a constant fraction $\alpha$ of the black hole entropy. In the Schrodinger picture, the boundary subregion encodes the $\alpha$-bits (a concept from quantum information) of a bulk region containing the black hole and bounded by extremal surfaces. These results have important consequences for the structure of AdS/CFT and for quantum information. Firstly, they imply that the bulk reconstruction is necessarily only approximate and allow us to place non-perturbative lower bounds on the error when doing so. Second, they provide a simple and tractable limit in which the entanglement wedge is state-dependent, but in a highly controlled way. Although the state dependence of operators comes from ordinary quantum error correction, there are clear connections to the Papadodimas-Raju proposal for understanding operators behind black hole horizons. In tensor network toy models of AdS/CFT, we see how state dependence arises from the bulk operator being `pushed' through the black hole itself. Finally, we show that black holes provide the first `explicit' examples of capacity-achieving $\alpha$-bit codes. Unintuitively, Hawking radiation always reveals the $\alpha$-bits of a black hole as soon as possible. In an appendix, we apply a result from the quantum information literature to prove that entanglement wedge reconstruction can be made exact to all orders in $1/N$.",hep,hep-th,"On complexity growth in massive gravity theories, the effects of chirality and more","To study the effect of parity-violation on the rate of complexity growth, by using ""Complexity=Action"" conjecture, we find the complexity growth rates in different solutions of the chiral theory of Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) and parity-preserving theory of New Massive Gravity (NMG). Using the results, one can see that decreasing the parameter $\mu$, which increases the effect of Chern-Simons term and increases chirality, would increase the rate of growth of complexity. Also one can observe a stronger correlation between complexity growth and temperature rather than complexity growth and entropy. At the end we comment on the possible meaning of the deforming term of chiral Liouville action for the rate of complexity growth of warped CFTs in the Tensor Network Renormalization picture.",hep,hep-th,1
AGN Jet Kinetic Power and the Energy Budget of Radio Galaxy Lobes,"Recent results based on the analysis of radio galaxies and their hot X-ray emitting atmospheres suggest that non-radiating particles dominate the energy budget in the lobes of FRI radio galaxies, in some cases by a factor of more than 1000, while radiating particles dominate the energy budget in FRII radio galaxy lobes. This implies a significant difference in the radiative efficiency of the two morphological classes. To test this hypothesis, we have measured the kinetic energy flux for a sample of 3C FRII radio sources using a new method based on the observed parameters of the jet terminal hotspots, and compared the resulting Q(jet) - L(radio) relation to that obtained for FRI radio galaxies based on X-ray cavity measurements. Contrary to expectations, we find approximate agreement between the Q(jet) - L(radio) relations determined separately for FRI and FRII radio galaxies. This result is ostensibly difficult to reconcile with the emerging scenario in which the lobes of FRI and FRII radio galaxies have vastly different energy budgets. However, a combination of lower density environment, spectral ageing and strong shocks driven by powerful FRII radio galaxies may reduce the radiative efficiency of these objects relative to FRIs and couteract, to some extent, the higher radiative efficiency expected to arise due to the lower fraction of energy in non-radiating particles. An unexpected corollary is that extrapolating the Q(jet) - L(radio) relation determined for low power FRI radio galaxies provides a reasonable approximation for high power sources, despite their apparently different lobe compositions.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,On the Evolution of the Cosmic Ionizing Background,"We study the observed cosmic ionizing background as a constraint on the nature of the sources responsible for the reionization of the Universe. In earlier work, we showed that extrapolations of the Ultra-Violet Luminosity Function (LF) of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at fixed Lyman continuum photon escape fraction are not able to reproduce the redshift evolution of this background. Here, we employ extrapolations of the high-z LFs to describe the contribution of LBGs to the ionizing photon rate, taking into account the smoothing of the baryonic perturbations, due to the background itself (i.e. the filtering mass), as well as a possible sharp increase of the escape fraction in dwarf galaxies. Under the hypothesis of a dominant contribution of LBGs to cosmic reionization, our results suggest that sources fainter than the current observational limits should be characterised by escape fractions of the order of ~0.1-0.3 (larger than the current estimates for bright galaxies) to account for a z>6 reionization and the measured evolution of cosmic ionizing background, at the same time. The contribution to the background from quasars turns out to be relevant at z<3. Overall, our results support the case for dedicated observations of faint galaxies in the rest-frame UV, in order to better determine their physical properties. Observed escape fractions outside our proposed range bear relevant consequences on the nature of the astrophysical sources responsible for cosmic reionization and/or its buildup process.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Scalably manufactured high-index atomic layer-polymer hybrid metasurfaces for high-efficiency virtual reality metaoptics in the visible,"Metalenses, which exhibit superior light-modulating performance with sub-micrometer-scale thicknesses, are suitable alternatives to conventional bulky refractive lenses. However, fabrication limitations, such as a high cost, low throughput, and small patterning area, hinder their mass production. Here, we demonstrate the mass production of low-cost, high-throughput, and large-aperture visible metalenses using an argon fluoride immersion scanner and wafer-scale nanoimprint lithography. Once a 12-inch master stamp is imprinted, hundreds of centimeter-scale metalenses can be fabricated. To enhance light confinement, the printed metasurface is thinly coated with a high-index film, resulting in drastic increase of conversion efficiency. As a proof of concept, a prototype of a virtual reality device with ultralow thickness is demonstrated with the fabricated metalens.",physics,physics.app-ph,Topolectrical-circuit octupole insulator with topologically protected corner states,"Recent theoretical studies have extended the Berry phase framework to account for higher electric multipole moments, quadrupole and octupole topological phases have been proposed. Although the two-dimensional quantized quadrupole insulators have been demonstrated experimentally, octupole topological phases have not previously been observed experimentally. Here we report on the experimental realization of classical analog of octupole topological insulator in the electric circuit system. Three-dimensional topolectrical circuits for realizing such topological phases are constructed experimentally. We observe octupole topological states protected by the topology of the bulk, which are localized at the corners. Our results provide conclusive evidence of a form of robustness against disorder and deformation, which is characteristic of octupole topological insulators. Our study opens a new route toward higher-order topological phenomena in three-dimensions and paves the way for employing topolectrical circuitry to study complex topological phenomena.",physics,physics.app-ph,1
Properties of a thin accretion disk around a rotating non-Kerr black hole,"We study the accretion process in the thin disk around a rotating non-Kerr black hole with a deformed parameter and an unbound rotation parameter. Our results show that the presence of the deformed parameter $\epsilon$ modifies the standard properties of the disk. For the case in which the black hole is more oblate than a Kerr black hole, the larger deviation leads to the smaller energy flux, the lower radiation temperature and the fainter spectra luminosity in the disk. For the black hole with positive deformed parameter, we find that the effect of the deformed parameter on the disk becomes more complicated. It depends not only on the rotation direction of the black hole and the orbit particles, but also on the sign of the difference between the deformed parameter $\epsilon$ and a certain critical value $\epsilon_{c}$. These significant features in the mass accretion process may provide a possibility to test the no-hair theorem in the strong field regime in future astronomical observations.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,An Eclipsing Black Widow Pulsar in NGC 6712,"We report the discovery of the first radio pulsar associated with NGC 6712, an eclipsing black widow (BW) pulsar, J1853$-$0842A, found by high-sensitivity searches using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. This 2.15 ms pulsar is in a 3.56 hr compact circular orbit with a very low mass companion likely of mass 0.018 to 0.036 $M_{\rm \odot}$ and exhibits eclipsing of the pulsar signal. Though the distance to PSR J1853$-$0842A predicted from its dispersion measure ($155.125 \pm 0.004$ cm$^{-3}$ pc) and Galactic free electron density models are about 30\% smaller than that of NGC 6712 obtained from interstellar reddening measurements, this is likely due to limited knowledge about the spiral arms and Scutum stellar cloud in this direction. Follow-up timing observations spanning 445 days allow us to localize the pulsar's position to be 0.14 core radii from the center of NGC 6712 and measure a negative spin-down rate for this pulsar of $-2.39(2)\times10^{-21}\rm s s^{-1}$. The latter cannot be explained without the acceleration of the GC and decisively supports the association between PSR J1853--0842A and NGC 6712. Considering the maximum GC acceleration, Galactic acceleration, and Shklovskii effect, we place an upper limit on the intrinsic spin-down rate to be $1.11\times10^{-20}\rm~s~s^{-1}$. From an analysis of the eclipsing observations, we estimate the electron density of the eclipse region to be about $1.88\times10^6\rm cm^{-3}$. We also place an upper limit of the accretion rate from the companion is about $3.05\times10^{-13}~M_{\rm \odot}\rm~yr^{-1}$ which is comparable with some other BWs.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Rapid generation of Mott insulators from arrays of noncondensed atoms,"We theoretically analyze a scheme for a fast adiabatic transfer of cold atoms from the atomic limit of isolated traps to a Mott-insulator close to the superfluid phase. This gives access to the Bose-Hubbard physics without the need of a prior Bose-Einstein condensate. The initial state can be prepared by combining the deterministic assembly of atomic arrays with resolved Raman sideband cooling. In the subsequent transfer the trap depth is reduced significantly. We derive conditions for the adiabaticity of this process and calculate optimal adiabatic ramp shapes. Using available experimental parameters, we estimate the impact of heating due to photon scattering and compute the fidelity of the transfer scheme. Finally, we discuss the particle number scaling behavior of the method for preparing low-entropy states. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art technology.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Immiscibile two-component Bose Einstein condensates beyond mean-field approximation: phase transitions and rotational response,"We consider a two-component immiscible Bose-Einstein condensate with dominating intra-species repulsive density-density interactions. In the ground-state phase of such a system only one condensates is present. This can be viewed as a spontaneous breakdown of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We study the phase diagram of the system at finite temperature beyond mean-field approximation. In the absence of rotation, we show that the system undergoes a first order phase transition from this ground state to a miscible two-component normal fluid as temperature is increased. In the presence of rotation, the system features a competition between vortex-vortex interaction and short range density-density interactions. This leads to a rotation-driven ""mixing"" phase transition in a spatially inhomogeneous state with additional broken $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry. Thermal fluctuations in this state lead to nematic two-component sheets of vortex liquids. At sufficiently strong inter-component interaction, we find that the superfluid and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase transitions split. This results in the formation of an intermediate state which breaks only $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. It represents two phase separated normal fluids with density imbalance.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,1
Numerical Investigation of Second Mode Attenuation over Carbon/Carbon Surfaces on a Sharp Slender Cone,"We have carried out axisymmetric numerical simulations of a spatially developing hypersonic boundary layer over a sharp 7$^{\circ{}}$-half-angle cone at $M_\infty=7.5$ inspired by the experimental investigations by Wagner (2015). Simulations are first performed with impermeable (or solid) walls with a one-time broadband pulse excitation applied upstream to determine the most convectively-amplified frequencies resulting in the range 260kHz -- 400kHz, consistent with experimental observations of second-mode instability waves. Subsequently, we introduce harmonic disturbances via continuous periodic suction and blowing at 270kHz and 350kHz. For each of these forcing frequencies complex impedance boundary conditions (IBC), modeling the acoustic response of two different carbon/carbon (C/C) ultrasonically absorptive porous surfaces, are applied at the wall. The IBCs are derived as an output of a pore-scale aeroacoustic analysis -- the inverse Helmholtz Solver (iHS) -- which is able to return the broadband real and imaginary components of the surface-averaged impedance. The introduction of the IBCs in all cases leads to a significant attenuation of the harmonically-forced second-mode wave. In particular, we observe a higher attenuation rate of the introduced waves with frequency of 350kHz in comparison with 270kHz, and, along with the iHS impedance results, we establish that the C/C surfaces absorb acoustic energy more effectively at higher frequencies.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,Local vortex line topology and geometry in turbulence,"The local streamline topology classification method of Chong et al. (1990) is adapted and extended to describe the geometry of infinitesimal vortex lines. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of forced isotropic turbulence reveals that joint probability density function (PDF) of the second ($q_\omega$) and third ($r_\omega$) normalized invariants of the vorticity gradient tensor asymptotes to a self-similar bell form beyond $Re_\lambda > 200$. The same PDF shape is also seen at the late stages of breakdown of Taylor-Green vortex suggesting the universality of the bell-shaped pdf form in turbulent flows. Additionally, vortex reconnection from different initial configurations is examined. The local topology and geometry of the reconnection bridge is shown to be identical in all cases with elliptic vortex lines on one side and hyperbolic filaments on the other. Overall, topological characterization of vorticity field provides a useful analytical basis for examining vorticity dynamics in turbulence and other fluid flows.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,1
Entanglement in a holographic Schwinger pair with confinement,"We revisit the entanglement of a Schwinger pair created by external fields of arbitrary strength, using a holographic dual description of QCD. When external fields are strong in comparison to the string tension, the entanglement is geometrically tied to the Einstein-Rosen (ER) bridge in the bulk, and disappears when the pair production is not exponentially suppressed at the boundary. For moderate external fields, the entanglement is shown to follow from the geometrical interplay between the position of the ER bridge and the confining wall in the bulk. We clarify the physical nature of quantum entanglement in pair production, and connect it to the entropy of entanglement between the left- and right-moving fermions. In particular, we clarify the effect of real radiation off the produced particles on quantum entanglement of the pair.",nucl,nucl-th,Varied Signature Splitting Phenomena in Odd Proton Nuclei,"Varied signature splitting phenomena in odd proton rare earth nuclei are investigated. Signature splitting as functions of $K$ and $j$ in the angular momentum projection theory is explicitly shown and compared with those of the particle rotor model. The observed deviations from these rules are due to the band mixings. The recently measured $^{169}$Ta high spin data are taken as a typical example where fruitful information about signature effects can be extracted. Six bands, two of which have not yet been observed, were calculated and discussed in detail in this paper. The experimentally unknown band head energies are given.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Modulation origin of 1/f noise in two-dimensional hopping,"We show that 1/f noise in a two-dimensional electron gas with hopping conduction can be explained by the modulation of conducting paths by fluctuating occupancy of non-conducting states. The noise is sensitive to the structure of the critical hopping network, which is varied by changing electron concentration, sample size and temperature. With increasing temperature, it clearly reveals the crossover between different hopping regimes.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Magneto-optical properties of Au upon the injection of hot spin-polarized electrons across Fe/Au(001) interfaces,"We demonstrate a novel method for the excitation of sizable magneto-optical effects in Au by means of the laser-induced injection of hot spin-polarized electrons in Au/Fe/MgO(001) heterostructures. It is based on the energy- and spin-dependent electron transmittance of Fe/Au interface which acts as a spin filter for non-thermalized electrons optically excited in Fe. We show that after crossing the interface, majority electrons propagate through the Au layer with the velocity on the order of 1 nm/fs (close to the Fermi velocity) and the decay length on the order of 100 nm. Featuring ultrafast functionality and requiring no strong external magnetic fields, spin injection results in a distinct magneto-optical response of Au. We develop a formalism based on the phase of the transient complex MOKE response and demonstrate its robustness in a plethora of experimental and theoretical MOKE studies on Au, including our ab initio calculations. Our work introduces a flexible tool to manipulate magneto-optical properties of metals on the femtosecond timescale that holds high potential for active magneto-photonics, plasmonics, and spintronics.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Bethe ansatz solution of the anisotropic correlated electron model associated with the Temperley-Lieb algebra,A recently proposed strongly correlated electron system associated with the Temperley-Lieb algebra is solved by means of the coordinate Bethe ansatz for periodic and closed boundary conditions.,nlin,nlin.SI,On the solutions of the second heavenly and Pavlov equations,"We have recently solved the inverse scattering problem for one parameter families of vector fields, and used this result to construct the formal solution of the Cauchy problem for a class of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations connected with the commutation of multidimensional vector fields, like the heavenly equation of Plebanski, the dispersionless Kadomtsev - Petviashvili (dKP) equation and the two-dimensional dispersionless Toda (2ddT) equation, as well as with the commutation of one dimensional vector fields, like the Pavlov equation. We also showed that the associated Riemann-Hilbert inverse problems are powerfull tools to establish if the solutions of the Cauchy problem break at finite time,to construct their longtime behaviour and characterize classes of implicit solutions. In this paper, using the above theory, we concentrate on the heavenly and Pavlov equations, i) establishing that their localized solutions evolve without breaking, unlike the cases of dKP and 2ddT; ii) constructing the longtime behaviour of the solutions of their Cauchy problems; iii) characterizing a distinguished class of implicit solutions of the heavenly equation.",nlin,nlin.SI,1
Time-resolved x-ray microscopy for materials science,"X-ray microscopy has been an indispensable tool to image nanoscale properties for materials research. One of its recent advances is to extend microscopic studies to the time domain for visualizing the dynamics of nanoscale phenomena. Large-scale x-ray facilities have been the powerhouse of time-resolved x-ray microscopy. Their upgrades including a significant reduction of the x-ray emittance at storage rings and fully coherent ultrashort x-ray pulses at free electron lasers, will lead to new developments in instrumentation and open new scientific opportunities for x-ray imaging of nanoscale dynamics with the simultaneous attainment of unprecedentedly high spatial and temporal resolutions. This review presents recent progress in and the outlook for time-resolved x-ray microscopy in the context of ultrafast nanoscale imaging and its applications to condensed matter physics and materials science.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Simulation of the thermally induced austenitic phase transition in NiTi nanoparticles,"The reverse martensitic (""austenitic"") transformation upon heating of equiatomic nickel-titanium nanoparticles with diameters between 4 and 17 nm is analyzed by means of molecular-dynamics simulations with a semi-empirical model potential. After constructing an appropriate order parameter to distinguish locally between the monoclinic B19' at low and the cubic B2 structure at high temperatures, the process of the phase transition is visualized. This shows a heterogeneous nucleation of austenite at the surface of the particles, which propagates to the interior by plane sliding, explaining a difference in austenite start and end temperatures. Their absolute values and dependence on particle diameter are obtained and related to calculations of the surface induced size dependence of the difference in free energy between austenite and martensite.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Stealth Supersymmetry Simplified,"In Stealth Supersymmetry, bounds on superpartners from direct searches can be notably weaker than in standard supersymmetric scenarios, due to suppressed missing energy. We present a set of simplified models of Stealth Supersymmetry that motivate 13 TeV LHC searches. We focus on simplified models within the Natural Supersymmetry framework, in which the gluino, stop, and Higgsino are assumed to be lighter than other superpartners. Our simplified models exhibit novel decay patterns that differ significantly from topologies of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, with and without $R$-parity. We determine limits on stops and gluinos from searches at the 8 TeV LHC. Existing searches constitute a powerful probe of Stealth Supersymmetry gluinos with certain topologies. However, we identify simplified models where the gluino can be considerably lighter than 1 TeV. Stops are significantly less constrained in Stealth Supersymmetry than the MSSM, and we have identified novel stop decay topologies that are completely unconstrained by existing LHC searches.",hep,hep-ph,Charmed baryon resonances with heavy-quark spin symmetry,"Charmed baryon resonances that are generated dynamically are studied within a unitary baryon-meson coupled-channel model, which incorporates heavy-quark spin symmetry. The extension of the SU(3) Weinberg-Tomozawa chiral Lagrangian to SU(8) spin-flavor symmetry plus a suitable symmetry breaking is used. The model produces resonances with negative parity from s-wave interaction of pseudoscalar and vector mesons with $1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$ baryons. Some of our dynamically generated states can be readily assigned to resonances found experimentally, while others do not have a straightforward identification and require the compilation of more data and also refinements of the model.",hep,hep-ph,1
Thickness dependence of unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance in metallic bilayers,"A nonlinear magnetoresistance - called unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance - is recently experimentally discovered in metallic bilayers consisting of a heavy metal and a ferromagnetic metal. To study the fundamental mechanism of the USMR, both ferromagnetic and heavy metallic layer thickness dependence of the USMR are presented in a Pt/Co/AlOx trilayer at room temperature. To avoid ambiguities, second harmonic Hall measurements are used for separating spin-Hall and thermal contributions to the non-linear magnetoresistance. The experimental results are fitted by using a drift-diffusion theory, with parameters extracted from an analysis of longitudinal resistivity of the Co layer within the framework of the Fuchs-Sondheimer model. A good agreement with the theory is found, demonstrating that the USMR is governed by both the spin-Hall effect in the heavy metallic layer and the metallic diffusion process in the ferromagnetic layer.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Little-Parks oscillations near a persistent current loop,"We investigate the Little-Parks oscillations caused by a persistent current loop set on the top edge of a mesoscopic superconducting thin-walled cylinder with a finite height. For a short cylinder the Little-Parks oscillations are approximately the same ones as the standard effect, as there is only one magnetic flux piercing the cylinder. For a tall cylinder the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field makes different magnetic fluxes pierce the cylinder at distinct heights and we show here that this produces two distinct Little-Parks oscillatory regimes according to the persistent current loop. We show that these two regimes, and also the transition between them, are observable in current measurements done in the superconducting cylinder. The two regimes stem from different behavior along the height, as seen in the order parameter, numerically obtained from the Ginzburg-Landau theory through the finite element method",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Protocol dependence of the jamming transition,"We propose a theoretical framework for predicting the protocol dependence of the jamming transition for frictionless spherical particles that interact via purely repulsive contact forces. We study isostatic jammed disk packings obtained via two protocols: isotropic compression and simple shear. We show that for frictionless systems, all jammed packings can be obtained via either protocol. However, the probability to obtain a particular jammed packing depends on the packing-generation protocol. We predict the average shear strain required to induce jamming in initially unjammed packings from the measured probability to jam at packing fraction $\phi$ from isotropic compression. We compare our predictions to results from numerical simulations of jamming and find quantitative agreement. We also show that the packing fraction range, over which strain-induced jamming occurs, tends to zero in the large system limit for frictionless packings with overdamped dynamics.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Anomalous mobility of a driven active particle in a steady laminar flow,"We study, via extensive numerical simulations, the force-velocity curve of an active particle advected by a steady laminar flow, in the nonlinear response regime. Our model for an active particle relies on a colored noise term that mimics its persistent motion over a time scale $\tau_A$. We find that the active particle dynamics shows non-trivial effects, such as negative differential and absolute mobility (NDM and ANM, respectively). We explore the space of the model parameters and compare the observed behaviors with those obtained for a passive particle ($\tau_A=0$) advected by the same laminar flow. Our results show that the phenomena of NDM and ANM are quite robust with respect to the details of the considered noise: in particular for finite $\tau_A$ a more complex force-velocity relation can be observed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
About a class of exact string backgrounds,This model also known as chiral null model is a generalization of the gravitational wave and fundamental string background and is exact in the $\a'$ expansion. The reduction to 4 dimensions yields a stationary IWP solution which couples to 7 gauge fields (one gravi-photon and 6 matter gauge fields) and 4 scalars. Special cases are the Taub-NUT geometry and rotating black holes. These solutions possess a T-self-dual point where the black hole becomes massless. Discussing the S-duality we show that the Taub-NUT geometry allows an S-self-dual point and that the electric black hole corresponds to a magnetic black hole or an H-monopole. We could identify the massless black hole as $N_L=0$ and confirm the H-monopole as an $N_L=1$ string states.,hep,hep-th,The gravitating perfect fluid-scalar field equations: quintessence and tachyonic,"The system consisting of a self gravitating perfect fluid and scalar field is considered in detail. The scalar fields considered are the quintessence and ``tachyonic'' forms which have important application in cosmology. Mathematical properties of the general system of equations are studied including the algebraic and differential identities as well as the eigenvalue structure. The Cauchy problem for both quintessence and the tachyon is presented. We discuss the initial constraint equations which must be satisfied by the initial data. A Cauchy evolution scheme is presented in the form of a Taylor series about the Cauchy surface. Finally, a simple numerical example is provided to illustrate this scheme.",hep,hep-th,1
Spin Mode-Switching at the Edge of a Quantum Hall System,"Quantum Hall states can be characterized by their chiral edge modes. Upon softening the edge potential, the edge has long been known to undergo spontaneous reconstruction driven by charging effects. In this paper we demonstrate a qualitatively distinct phenomenon driven by exchange effects, in which the ordering of the edge modes at $\nu=3$ switches abruptly as the edge potential is made softer, while the ordering in the bulk remains intact. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is robust, and has many verifiable experimental signatures in transport.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Vibronic interaction in crystals with the Jahn-Teller centers in the elementary energy bands concept,"The order-disorder type phase transition caused by the vibronic interaction (collective Jahn-Teller effect) in a monoclinic CuInP$_2$S$_6$ crystal is analyzed. For this purpose, a trigonal protostructure model of CuInP$_2$S$_6$ is created, through a slight change in the crystal lattice parameters of the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ paraelectric phase. In parallel to the group-theoretical analysis, the DFT-based {\it ab initio} band structure calculations of the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ protostructure, para-, and ferriphases are performed. Using the elementary energy bands concept, a part of the band structure from the vicinity of the forbidden energy gap, which is created by the $d$-electron states of copper, has been related with a certain Wyckoff position where the Jahn-Teller's centers are localized. A construction procedure of the vibronic potential energy matrix is generalized for the case of crystal using the elementary energy bands concept and the group theoretical method of invariants. The procedure is illustrated by the creation of the adiabatic potentials of the $\Gamma_5$-$\Gamma_5$ vibronic coupling for the protostructure and paraphase of the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ crystal. A structure of the obtained adiabatic potentials is analyzed, followed by conclusions on their transformation under a phase transition and the discussion on the possibility for the spontaneous polarization to arise in this crystal.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS): Catalog of galaxy clusters and groups,"The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey has been carried out during the PV phase of the SRG/eROSITA telescope and completed in November 2019. This survey is designed to provide the first eROSITA-selected sample of galaxy clusters and groups and to test the predictions for the all-sky survey in the context of cosmological studies with clusters. In the 140 deg$^2$ area covered by eFEDS, 542 candidate clusters and groups are detected as extended X-ray sources, down to a flux of $\sim10^{-14} $erg/s/cm$^2$ in the soft band (0.5-2 keV) within 1'. In this work, we provide the catalog of candidate galaxy clusters and groups in eFEDS. We perform imaging and spectral analysis on the eFEDS clusters with eROSITA X-ray data, and study the properties of the sample. The clusters are distributed in the redshift range [0.01, 1.3], with the median redshift at 0.35. We obtain the ICM temperature measurement with $>2\sigma$ c.l. for $\sim$1/5 (102/542) of the sample. The average temperature of these clusters is $\sim$2 keV. Radial profiles of flux, luminosity, electron density, and gas mass are measured from the precise modeling of the imaging data. The selection function, the purity and completeness of the catalog are examined and discussed in detail. The contamination fraction is $\sim1/5$ in this sample, dominated by misidentified point sources. The X-ray Luminosity Function of the clusters agrees well with the results obtained from other recent X-ray surveys. We also find 19 supercluster candidates in eFEDS, most of which are located at redshifts between 0.1 and 0.5. The eFEDS cluster and group catalog provides a benchmark proof-of-concept for the eROSITA All-Sky Survey extended source detection and characterization. We confirm the excellent performance of eROSITA for cluster science and expect no significant deviations from our pre-launch expectations for the final All-Sky Survey.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,"CLASH: Joint Analysis of Strong-Lensing, Weak-Lensing Shear and Magnification Data for 20 Galaxy Clusters","We present a comprehensive analysis of strong-lensing, weak-lensing shear and magnification data for a sample of 16 X-ray-regular and 4 high-magnification galaxy clusters selected from the CLASH survey. Our analysis combines constraints from 16-band HST observations and wide-field multi-color imaging taken primarily with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. We reconstruct surface mass density profiles of individual clusters from a joint analysis of the full lensing constraints, and determine masses and concentrations for all clusters. We find internal consistency of the ensemble mass calibration to be $\le 5\% \pm 6\%$ by comparison with the CLASH weak-lensing-only measurements of Umetsu et al. For the X-ray-selected subsample, we examine the concentration-mass relation and its intrinsic scatter using a Bayesian regression approach. Our model yields a mean concentration of $c|_{z=0.34} = 3.95 \pm 0.35$ at $M_{200c} \simeq 14\times 10^{14}M_\odot$ and an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma(\ln c_{200c}) = 0.13 \pm 0.06$, in excellent agreement with LCDM predictions when the CLASH selection function based on X-ray morphological regularity and the projection effects are taken into account. We also derive an ensemble-averaged surface mass density profile for the X-ray-selected subsample by stacking their individual profiles. The stacked mass profile is well described by a family of density profiles predicted for cuspy dark-matter-dominated halos, namely, the NFW, Einasto, and DARKexp models, whereas the single power-law, cored isothermal and Burkert density profiles are disfavored by the data. We show that cuspy halo models that include the two-halo term provide improved agreement with the data. For the NFW halo model, we measure a mean concentration of $c_{200c} = 3.79^{+0.30}_{-0.28}$ at $M_{200c} = 14.1^{+1.0}_{-1.0}\times 10^{14}M_\odot$, demonstrating consistency between complementary analysis methods.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Two-dimensional easy-plane SU$(3)$ magnet with the transverse field: Anisotropy-driven multicriticality,"The two-dimensional easy-plane SU$(3)$ magnet subjected to the transverse field was investigated with the exact-diagonalization method. So far, as to the $XY$ model (namely, the easy-plane SU$(2)$ magnet), the transverse-field-driven order-disorder phase boundary has been investigated with the exact-diagonalization method, and it was claimed that the end-point singularity (multicriticality) at the $XX$-symmetric point does not accord with large-$N$-theory's prediction. Aiming to reconcile the discrepancy, we extend the internal symmetry to the easy-plane SU$(3)$ with the anisotropy parameter $\eta$, which interpolates the isotropic ($\eta=0$) and fully anisotropic ($\eta=1$) cases smoothly. As a preliminary survey, setting $\eta=1$, we analyze the order-disorder phase transition through resorting to the fidelity susceptibility $\chi_F$, which exhibits a pronounced signature for the criticality. Thereby, with $\eta$ scaled carefully, the $\chi_F$ data are cast into the crossover-scaling formula so as to determine the crossover exponent $\phi$, which seems to reflect the extension of the internal symmetry group to SU(3).",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Equivalence of Spatial and Particle Entanglement Growth After a Quantum Quench,"We analyze fermions after an interaction quantum quench in one spatial dimension and study the growth of the steady state entanglement entropy density under either a spatial mode or particle bipartition. For integrable lattice models, we find excellent agreement between the increase of spatial and particle entanglement entropy, and for chaotic models, an examination of two further neighbor interaction strengths suggests similar correspondence. This result highlights the generality of the dynamical conversion of entanglement to thermodynamic entropy under time evolution that underlies our current framework of quantum statistical mechanics.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
Inverse magneto-rotational catalysis and the phase diagram of a rotating hot and magnetized quark matter,"We study the properties of a hot and magnetized quark matter in a rotating cylinder in the presence of a constant magnetic field. To do this, we solve the corresponding Dirac equation using the Ritus eigenfunction method. This leads to the energy dispersion relation, Ritus eigenfunctions, and the quantization relation for magnetized fermions. To avoid causality-violating effects, we impose a certain global boundary condition, and study its effect, in particular, on the energy eigenmodes and the quantization relations of fermions. Using the fermion propagator arising from this method, we then solve the gap equation at zero and nonzero temperatures. At zero temperature, the dynamical mass $\bar{m}$ does not depend on the angular frequency, as expected. We thus study its dependence on the distance $r$ relative to the axis of rotation and the magnetic field $B$, and explore the corresponding finite size effect for various couplings $G$. We then consider the finite temperature case. The dependence of $\bar{m}$ on the temperature $T$, magnetic field $B$, angular frequency $\Omega$, and distance $r$ for various $G$ is studied. We show that $\bar{m}$ decreases, in general, with $B$ and $\Omega$. This is the ''inverse magneto-rotational catalysis (IMRC)'' or the ''rotational magnetic inhibition'', previously discussed in the literature. To explore the evidence of this effect in the phase diagrams of our model, we examine the phase portraits of the critical temperature $T_c$ as well as the critical angular frequency $\Omega_c$ with respect to $G, B,\Omega$, and $r$ as well as $G, B, T$, and $r$, respectively. We show that $T_{c}$ and $\Omega_c$ decrease, in particular, with $B$. This is interpreted as clear evidence for IMRC.",hep,hep-ph,"Tensor mesons, AdS/QCD and information","The Kaluza-Klein tower of higher spin-$S$ tensor meson resonances is here scrutinized in the AdS/QCD hard wall model, encompassing the already established resonances $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$, $\omega_3(1670)$, $f_4(2050)$, $\rho_5(2350)$, $f_6(2510)$ in PDG. A hybrid model employs both information theory and AdS/QCD, where configurational-entropic Regge trajectories, relating the configurational entropy of the tensor mesons family to their $S$ spin, and also to their experimental mass spectra, are derived and analyzed. Therefore, the mass spectra of higher spin-$S$ tensor meson resonances is obtained and compared to the existing data in PDG.",hep,hep-ph,1
Disorder-induced rippled phases and multicriticality in free-standing graphene,"One of the most exciting phenomena observed in crystalline disordered membranes, including a suspended graphene, is rippling, i.e. a formation of static flexural deformations. Despite an active research, it still remains unclear whether the rippled phase exists in the thermodynamic limit, or it is destroyed by thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that a sufficiently strong short-range disorder stabilizes ripples, whereas in the case of a weak disorder the thermal flexural fluctuations dominate in the thermodynamic limit. The phase diagram of the disordered suspended graphene contains two separatrices: the crumpling transition line dividing the flat and crumpled phases and the rippling transition line demarking the rippled and clean phases. At the intersection of the separatrices there is the unstable, multicritical point which splits up all four phases. Most remarkably, rippled and clean flat phases are described by a single stable fixed point which belongs to the rippling transition line. Coexistence of two flat phases in the single point is possible due to non-analiticity in corresponding renormalization group equations and reflects non-commutativity of limits of vanishing thermal and rippling fluctuations.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Characterizing multi-mode nonlinear dynamics of nanomechanical resonators,"Mechanical nonlinearities dominate the motion of nanoresonators already at relatively small oscillation amplitudes. Although single and coupled two-degrees-of-freedom models have been used to account for experimentally observed nonlinear effects, it is shown that these models quickly deviate from experimental findings when multiple modes influence the nonlinear response. Here, we present a nonlinear reduced-order modelling methodology based on FEM simulations for capturing the global nonlinear dynamics of nanomechanical resonators. Our physics-based approach obtains the quadratic and cubic nonlinearities of resonators over a wide frequency range that spans 70 MHz. To qualitatively validate our approach, we perform experiments on a graphene nanodrum driven opto-thermally and show that the model can replicate diverse ranges of nonlinear phenomena, including multi-stability, parametric resonance, and different internal resonances without considering any empirical nonlinear fitting parameters. By providing a direct link between microscopic geometry, material parameters, and nonlinear dynamic response, we clarify the physical significance of nonlinear parameters that are obtained from fitting the dynamics of nanomechanical systems, and provide a route for designing devices with desired nonlinear behaviour.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Supercooled Liquids under Shear: Computational Approach,"We have performed molecular dynamics simulations for a model two-dimensional soft-core mixture in a supercooled state. The mixture exhibits a slow structural relaxation in a quiescent state, however, the relaxation is much enhanced in sheared states. There observed surprisingly small anisotropy both in the coherent and incoherent density correlation functions even under extremely strong shear which is $10^3$ times faster than the structural relaxation rate. The present simulation results agree well with predictions of the recently developed mode-coupling theory in shear.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,The effect of curvature on cholesteric doughnuts,"The confinement of liquid crystals inside curved geometries leads to exotic structures, with applications ranging from bio-sensors to optical switches and privacy windows. Here we study how curvature affects the alignment of a cholesteric liquid crystal. We model the system on the mesoscale using the Landau-de Gennes model. Our study was performed in three stages, analysing different curved geometries from cylindrical walls and pores, to toroidal domains, in order to isolate the curvature effects. Our results show that the stresses introduced by the curvature influence the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules, and cause distortions in the natural periodicity of the cholesteric that depend on the radius of curvature and on the commensurability between the pitch and the dimensions of the system. In particular, the cholesteric layers of toroidal droplets exhibit a symmetry breaking not seen in cylindrical pores and that is driven by the additional curvature.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Phenomenological Estimation of Parameters in minimal Supergravity Model,"Several parameters of the minimal supergravity model are estimated by the method of the renormalization group. In this model, five arbitrary parameters $(m_0, m_{1/2}, \tan{\beta}, A_0, {sig}(\mu))$ are contained. $\tan{\beta}$ is evaluated as 7.5 by the likelihood analysis of the gauge and Yukawa coupling constants. Further, the trilinear coupling constant $A_0$ is fixed by the equation of $B_0=(A_0-1)m_0$ at the GUT scale $M_X \simeq 2\times10^{16}$(GeV) and by the Higgs potential at the Z-boson mass scale $M_Z=$91(GeV). As the results, (1) allowed $m_0-m_{1/2}$ regions, (2) the sparticle mass spectra, and (3) the lightest supersymmetric particle mass are shown in this paper.",hep,hep-ph,Transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependences of $'\bm{Mach-like}'$ correlations for central Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV,"The transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependences of partonic {`\it{Mach-like}'} shock wave have been studied by using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) with both partonic and hadronic interactions. The splitting parameter $D$, i.e. half distance between two splitting peaks on away side in di-hadron azimuthal angular ($\Delta\phi$) correlations, slightly increases with the transverse momentum of associated hadrons ($p^{assoc}_T$), which is consistent with preliminary experimental trend, owing to different interaction-lengths/numbers between wave partons and medium in strong parton cascade. On the other hand, the splitting parameter $D$ as a function of pseudorapidity of associated hadrons ($\eta^{assoc}$), keeps flat in mid-pseudorapidity region and rapidly drops in high-pseudorapidity region, which is as a result of different violent degrees of jet-medium interactions in the medium that has different energy densities in the longitudinal direction. It is proposed that the research on the properties of {`\it{Mach-like}'} correlation can shed light on the knowledge of both partonic and hadronic interactions at RHIC.",hep,hep-ph,1
Comment on: ``Trace anomaly of dilaton coupled scalars in two dimensions'',The trace anomaly for nonminimally coupled scalars in spherically reduced gravity obtained by Bousso and Hawking (hep-th/9705236) is incorrect.

Investigating saturation effects in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC with the color dipole model,"We investigate saturation effects in $ep$ scattering as well as in ultraperipheral $p$A and AA collisions at small $x$ with four variants of the impact parameter dependent color dipole model: with and without gluon saturation and with and without a novel mechanism that suppresses unphysical dipole radii above the confinement scale, a problem not addressed by most implementations. We show that $ep$ scattering at HERA can be very well described by any of the four variants. When going from $ep$ to $e$A scattering, saturation effects are expected to increase as $\sim$A$^{1/3}$. In lieu of an electron-ion collider, we confront the different versions of the dipole model with data recorded in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC in order to estimate the sensitivity of the data to gluon saturation in the target nuclei. We find that ultraperipheral PbPb collisions indicate strong saturation effects while $p$Pb collisions turn out to not have any discriminating power to distinguish saturation from non-saturation scenarios.",nucl,nucl-ex,Alpha-induced reactions for the astrophysical p-process: the case of 151Eu,"The cross sections of 151Eu(alpha,gamma)155Tb and 151Eu(alpha,n)154Tb reactions have been measured with the activation method.

The Rate and Spatial Distribution of Novae in M31 as Determined by a Twenty-Year Survey,"A long-term (1995-2016) survey for novae in the nearby Andromeda galaxy (M31) was conducted as part of the Research-Based Science Education initiative. During the course of the survey 180 nights of observation were completed at Kitt Peak, Arizona. A total of 262 novae were either discovered or confirmed, 40 of which have not been previously reported. Of these, 203 novae form a spatially-complete sample detected by the KPNO/WIYN 0.9-m telescope within a $20'\times20'$ field centered on the nucleus of M31. An additional 50 novae are part of a spatially-complete sample detected by the KPNO 4-m telescope within a larger $36'\times36'$ field. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the spatial distribution of novae in both surveys follows the bulge light of M31 somewhat more closely than the overall background light of the galaxy. After correcting for the limiting magnitude and the spatial and temporal coverage of the surveys, a final nova rate in M31 is found to be $R=40^{+5}_{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is considerably lower than recent estimates. When normalized to the $K$-band luminosity of M31, this value yields a luminosity-specific nova rate, $\nu_K = 3.3\pm0.4$ yr$^{-1} [10^{10} L_{\odot,K}]^{-1}$. By scaling the M31 nova rate using the relative infrared luminosities of M31 and our Galaxy, a nova rate of $R_\mathrm{G}=28^{+5}_{-4}$ is found for the Milky Way.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Rotating and infalling motion around the high-mass young stellar object Cepheus A-HW2 observed with the methanol maser at 6.7 GHz,"We have measured the internal proper motions of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers associated with Cepheus A (Cep A) HW2 using Very Long Baseline Interferometery (VLBI) observations. We conducted three epochs of VLBI monitoring observations of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers in Cep A-HW2 with the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN) over the period between 2006-2008. In 2006, we were able to use phase-referencing to measure the absolute coordinates of the maser emission with an accuracy of a few milliarcseconds. We compared the maser distribution with other molecular line observations that trace the rotating disk. We measured the internal proper motions for 29 methanol maser spots, of which 19 were identified at all three epochs and the remaining ten at only two epochs. The magnitude of proper motions ranged from 0.2 to 7.4 km/s, with an average of 3.1 km/s. Although there are large uncertainties in the observed internal proper motions of the methanol maser spots in Cep A, they are well fitted by a disk that includes both rotation and infall velocity components. The derived rotation and infall velocities at the disk radius of 680 au are 0.5 +- 0.7 and 1.8 +- 0.7 km/s, respectively. Assuming that the modeled disk motion accurately represents the accretion disk around the Cep A-HW2 high-mass YSO, we estimated the mass infall rate to be 3 x 10^{-4} n_8 Msun/yr (n_8 is the gas volume density in units of 10^{8} cm^{-3}). The combination of the estimated mass infall rate and the magnitude of the fitted infall velocity suggests that Cep A-HW2 is at an evolutionary phase of active gas accretion from the disk onto the central high-mass YSO. The infall momentum rate is estimated to be 5 x 10^{-4} n_8 Msun/yr km/s, which is larger than the estimated stellar radiation pressure of the HW2 object, supporting the hypothesis that this object is in an active gas accretion phase.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
The leading non-perturbative coefficient in the weak-coupling expansion of hot QCD pressure,"Using Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory within three-dimensional pure SU(3) gauge theory, we estimate the last unknown renormalization constant that is needed for converting the vacuum energy density of this model from lattice regularization to the MSbar scheme.

Is is shown that these physical quantities are quite sensitive to the new Wilson coefficients. Determination of the position of zero value of the forward-backward asymmetry can serve as a useful tool for establishing new physics beyond the standard model, as well as fixing the sign of the new Wilson coefficients.",hep,hep-ph,1
"ADJOINT ""QUARK"" COLOR FIELDS IN FOUR-DIMENSIONAL LATTICE GAUGE THEORY: VACUUM SCREENING AND PENETRATION","The fields generated by ``quarks'' in the adjoint representation of SU(2) color are analyzed in the scaling region of the four-dimensional lattice theory. Evidence of vacuum screening of adjoint quarks is obtained from a comparison of quark-antiquark ($Q \bar Q$) flux-tubes for quarks in the adjoint (``isospin'' $j=1$) and fundamental ($j=1/2$) representations. The component ${\cal E}_j$ of the color-electric field strength in the direction parallel to the $Q \bar Q$ axis is calculated. Near the quarks the ratio of fields ${\cal E}_{j=1} / {\cal E}_{j=1/2}$ approaches the value 8/3, which is equal to the ratio of SU(2) Casimirs. In between the quarks, the ratio falls well below 8/3 at large $R$. ${\cal E}_j$ also falls off rapidly as a function of distance $x_\perp$ perpendicular to the $Q \bar Q$ axis. However, the ratio ${\cal E}_{j=1} / {\cal E}_{j=1/2}$ depends very weakly on $x_\perp$. The flux-tubes in the two representations thus appear to have very similar cross-sections. This result could imply that the QCD vacuum is dual to a type I superconductor.",hep,hep-lat,QED on a momentum lattice,We investigate the possibility of doing momentum space lattice simulations as an alternative to the conventional method.

Utilizing the Updated Gamma-Ray Bursts and Type Ia Supernovae to Constrain the Cardassian Expansion Model and Dark Energy,"We update gamma-ray burst (GRB) luminosity relations among certain spectral and light-curve features with 139 GRBs. The distance modulus of 82 GRBs at $z>1.4$ can be calibrated with the sample at $z\leq1.4$ by using the cubic spline interpolation method from the Union2.1 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) set. We investigate the joint constraints on the Cardassian expansion model and dark energy with 580 Union2.1 SNe Ia sample ($z<1.4$) and 82 calibrated GRBs data ($1.4<z\leq8.2$). In $\Lambda$CDM, we find that adding 82 high-\emph{z} GRBs to 580 SNe Ia significantly improves the constrain on $\Omega_{m}-\Omega_{\Lambda}$ plane. In the Cardassian expansion model, the best fit is $\Omega_{m}= 0.24_{-0.15}^{+0.15}$ and $n=0.16_{-0.52}^{+0.30}$ $(1\sigma)$, which is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology $(n=0)$ in the $1\sigma$ confidence region. We also discuss two dark energy models in which the equation of state $w(z)$ is parametrized as $w(z)=w_{0}$ and $w(z)=w_{0}+w_{1}z/(1+z)$, respectively. Based on our analysis, we see that our Universe at higher redshift up to $z=8.2$ is consistent with the concordance model within $1\sigma$ confidence level.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Leptogenesis in supersymmetry with one $L$ violating coupling,We have shown a new scenario of successful leptogenesis with one $L$ violating coupling and a relative Majorana phase playing the role of $CP$ violation. This is in contrast to the usual consideration of Feynman diagram with at least two $L$ violating couplings. We have considered $R$-parity violating Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) for leptogenesis at TeV scale. This scenario is also consistent with generating light neutrino mass if asymmetry is generated through semileptonic $\lambda^{\prime}$ coupling.,astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Improving sound absorption through nonlinear active electroacoustic resonators,"Absorbing airborne noise at frequencies below 300 Hz is a particularly vexing problem due to the absence of natural sound absorbing materials at these frequencies. The prevailing solution for low-frequency sound absorption is the use of passive narrow-band resonators, whose absorption level and bandwidth can be further enhanced using nonlinear effects. However, these effects are typically triggered at high intensity levels, without much control over the form of the nonlinear absorption mechanism. In this study, we propose, implement, and experimentally demonstrate a nonlinear active control framework on an electroacoustic resonator prototype, allowing for unprecedented control over the form of non-linearity, and arbitrarily low sound intensity thresholds. More specifically, the proposed architecture combines a linear feedforward control on the front pressure through a first microphone located at the front face of the loudspeaker, and a nonlinear feedback on the membrane displacement estimated through the measurement of the pressure inside the back cavity with a second microphone located in the enclosure. It is experimentally shown that even at a weak excitation level, it is possible to observe and control the nonlinear behaviour of the system. Taking the cubic nonlinearity as an example, we demonstrate numerically and experimentally that in the low frequency range ([50 Hz, 500 Hz]), the nonlinear control law allows improving the sound absorption performance, i.e. enlarging the bandwidth of optimal sound absorption while increasing the maximal absorption coefficient value, and producing only a negligible amount of nonlinear distortion. The reported experimental methodology can be extended to implement various types of hybrid linear and/or nonlinear controls, thus opening new avenues for managing wave nonlinearity and achieving non-trivial wave phenomena.",physics,physics.app-ph,Bidirectional electro-optic conversion reaching 1% efficiency with thin-film lithium niobate,"Superconducting cavity electro-optics (EO) presents a promising route to coherently convert microwave and optical photons and distribute quantum entanglement between superconducting circuits over long-distance through an optical network. High EO conversion efficiency demands transduction materials with strong Pockels effect and excellent optical transparency. Thin-film Lithium Niobate (TFLN) offers these desired characteristics however so far has only delivered unidirectional conversion with efficiencies on the order of $10^{-5}$, largely impacted by its prominent photorefractive (PR) effect at cryogenic temperatures. Here we show that, by mitigating the PR effect and associated charge-screening effect, the device's conversion efficiency can be enhanced by orders of magnitude while maintaining stable cryogenic operation, thus allowing a demonstration of conversion bidirectionality and accurate quantification of on-chip efficiency. With the optimized monolithic integrated superconducting EO device based on TFLN-on-sapphire substrate, an on-chip conversion efficiency of 1.02% (internal efficiency, 15.2%) is realized. Our demonstration indicates that with further device improvement, it is feasible for TFLN to approach unitary internal conversion efficiency.",physics,physics.app-ph,1
Anomalous Dynamics and Equilibration in the Classical Heisenberg Chain,"The search for departures from standard hydrodynamics in many-body systems has yielded a number of promising leads, especially in low dimension. Here we study one of the simplest classical interacting lattice models, the nearest-neighbour Heisenberg chain, with temperature as tuning parameter. Our numerics expose strikingly different spin dynamics between the antiferromagnet, where it is largely diffusive, and the ferromagnet, where we observe strong evidence either of spin super-diffusion or an extremely slow crossover to diffusion. This difference also governs the equilibration after a quench, and, remarkably, is apparent even at very high temperatures.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Electric Ferro-Axial Moment as Nanometric Rotator and Source of Longitudinal Spin Current,"An electric ferro-axial moment, which is characterized by a nonzero expectation value of a time-reversal-even axial vector, exhibits distinct spatial-inversion and time-reversal properties from conventional ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, and ferro-magnetoelectric orders. Nevertheless, physical properties characteristic of the electric ferro-axial moment have been obscure owing to the absence of its conjugate electromagnetic fields. We theoretically investigate consequences of the presence of the ferro-axial moment on the basis of the symmetry and microscopic model analyses. We show that atomic-scale electric toroidal multipoles are the heart of the ferro-axial moment, which act as a nanometric rotator against external stimuli. Furthermore, we propose an intrinsic generation of a spin current parallel to an applied electric field in both metals and insulators. Our results not only provide a deep microscopic understanding of the role of the ferro-axial moment but also stimulate a new development for functional materials with use of the electric toroidal moment.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Investigations of Azimuthal Asymmetry in Semi-Inclusive Leptoproduction,"We consider the azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic leptoproduction arising due to both perturbative and nonperturbative effects at HERMES energies and show that the $k_T^2/Q^2$ order corrections to $< \cos\phi >$ and $< \cos2\phi >$ are significant. We also reconsider the results of perturbative effects for $< \cos\phi >$ at large momentum transfers \cite{A1} using the more recent sets of scale-dependent distribution and fragmentation functions, which bring up to $18{%}$ difference in $< \cos\phi >$. In the same approach we calculate the $< \cos2\phi >$ as well.",hep,hep-ph,Associated top quark pair production with a heavy boson: differential cross sections at NLO+NNLL accuracy,"We present theoretical predictions for selected differential cross sections for the process $pp \to t \bar{t} B$ at the LHC, where $B$ can be a Higgs ($H$), a $Z$ or a $W$ boson. The predictions are calculated in the direct QCD framework up to the next-to-next-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy and matched to the complete NLO results including QCD and electroweak effects. Additionally, results for the total cross sections are provided. The calculations deliver a significant improvement of the theoretical predictions, especially for the $t \bar{t} H$ and the $t \bar{t} Z$ production. In these cases, predictions for both the total and differential cross sections are remarkably stable with respect to the central scale choice and carry a substantially reduced scale uncertainty in comparison with the complete NLO predictions.",hep,hep-ph,1
Charmed mesons and leptons from semileptonic decays at the LHC,"We discuss production of charmed mesons as well as electrons/muons from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom mesons in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The cross section for inclusive production of $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ pairs is calculated in the framework of the $k_{\perp}$-factorization approach. Here, the KMR and Jung CCFM unintegrated gluon distribution functions are used. Theoretical uncertainties of the model related to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales as well as due to the quark mass are also discussed. The hadronization of charm and bottom quarks is included within the fragmentation functions technique. Inclusive differential distributions in transverse momentum of charmed mesons are presented and compared to recent results of the ALICE collaboration. Furthermore, we also consider production of different $D \bar D$ pairs in unique kinematics of forward rapidities of the LHCb experiment. Kinematical correlations in azimuthal angle $\varphi_{D\bar D}$ and invariant mass $M_{D \bar D}$ distributions are presented and compared to LHCb data. Furthermore, the semileptonic decays of charm and bottom mesons are done with the help of decay functions found by fitting recent semileptonic data obtained by the CLEO and BABAR collaborations. Inclusive differential distributions in transverse momentum of leptons for several kinematical regions are presented and compared to recent results of the ALICE and CMS collaborations.",hep,hep-ex,Novel experimental probes of QCD in SIDIS and $e^+e^-$ annihilation,"Semi-inclusive deep inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) has been a very successful tool to investigate the partonic structure of the nucleon over the last decade. Compared to inclusive DIS, information about the quantum numbers of the struck quark can be inferred from the identity, distribution and polarization of the final state hadrons. Up to now, virtually all knowledge about the quark-gluon structure of the nucleon from SIDIS has been gained from distributions of independently observed scalar hadrons. However, given the amount of data current and future experiments at JLab, RHIC, KEK and the EIC will collect, new paradigms have to be explored to leverage the statistical power of the data. Similar to other felds in nuclear and particle physics, it is natural to move towards the exploration of more complex correlations in the observed fi nal state. This contribution will discuss recent results and future prospects of using di-hadron correlations and polarized hyperon probes to study QCD in SIDIS, pp and e+e- annihilation. Both of these probes exploit additional degrees of freedom in the final state, given by the relative momentum of the di-hadron pair and the hyperon polarization, respectively. This contribution will focus on recent results and opportunities opened by these probes to study nucleon structure, hadronization and QCD in novel ways. The focus will be on planned SIDIS measurements at CLAS12 at JLab and e+e- at Belle II.",hep,hep-ex,1
"The Two-Parameter Brane Sigma-Model: M*, M' solutions and M-theory solutions dependent on exotic coordinates","We investigate two-parameter solutions of sigma-models on two dimensional symmetric spaces contained in E11. Embedding such sigma-model solutions in space-time gives solutions of M* and M'-theory where the metric depends on general travelling wave functions, as opposed to harmonic functions typical in general relativity, supergravity and M-theory. Weyl reflection allows such solutions to be mapped to M-theory solutions where the wave functions depend explicitly on extra coordinates contained in the fundamental representation of E11.",hep,hep-th,More on superstring chiral measures,"In this paper we study the expressions of the superstring chiral measures for $g\leq 5$. We obtain certain new expressions which are functions of higher powers of theta constants. For $g=3$ we show that the measures can be written in terms of fourth power of theta constants and for $g=4$ in terms of squares of theta constants. In both cases the forms $\Xi_8^{(g)}[0^{(g)}]$ appearing in the expression of the measures are defined on the whole Siegel upper half space. Instead, for $g=5$ we find a form $\Xi_8^{(5)}[0^{(5)}]$ which is a polynomial in the classical theta constants, well defined on the Siegel upper half space and satisfying some suitable constraints on the moduli space of curves (and not on the whole Siegel upper half space) that could be a candidate for the genus five superstring measure. Moreover, we discuss the problem of the uniqueness of this form in genus five. We also determine the dimension of certain spaces of modular forms and reinterpret the vanishing of the cosmological constant in terms of group representations.",hep,hep-th,1
Constraining the equation of state with heavy quarks in the quasi-particle model of QCD matter,"In a quasi-particle model of QCD matter at finite temperature with thermal masses for quarks and gluons from hard thermal loops, the equation of state (EOS) can be described by an effective temperature dependence of the strong coupling $g(T)$. Assuming the same effective coupling between the exchanged gluon and thermal partons, the EOS can also be related to parton energy loss.} Based on the quasi-particle linear Boltzmann transport (QLBT) model coupled to a (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) evolution and a hybrid fragmentation-coalescence model for heavy quark hadronization, we perform a Bayesian analysis of the experimental data on $D$ meson suppression $R_{\rm AA}$ and anisotropy $v_2$ at RHIC and the LHC. We achieve a simultaneous constraint on the QGP EOS and the heavy quark transport coefficient, both consistent with the lattice QCD results.",nucl,nucl-th,Global performance of covariant density functional theory in description of charge radii and related indicators,"A short review of existing efforts to understand charge radii and related indicators on a global scale within the covariant density functional theory (CDFT) is presented. Using major classes of covariant energy density functionals (CEDFs), the global accuracy of the description of experimental absolute and differential charge radii within the CDFT framework has been established. This assessment is supplemented by an evaluation of theoretical statistical and systematic uncertainties in the description of charge radii. New results on the accuracy of the description of differential charge radii in deformed actinides and light superheavy nuclei are presented and the role of octupole deformation in their reproduction is evaluated. Novel mechanisms leading to odd-even staggering in charge radii are discussed. Finally, we analyze the role of self-consistency effects in an accurate description of differential charge radii.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Ultralight Particle Dark Matter,"We review the physics case for very weakly coupled ultralight particles beyond the Standard Model, in particular for axions and axion-like particles (ALPs): (i) the axionic solution of the strong CP problem and its embedding in well motivated extensions of the Standard Model; (ii) the possibility that the cold dark matter in the Universe is comprised of axions and ALPs; (iii) the ALP explanation of the anomalous transparency of the Universe for TeV photons; and (iv) the axion or ALP explanation of the anomalous energy loss of white dwarfs. Moreover, we present an overview of ongoing and near-future laboratory experiments searching for axions and ALPs: haloscopes, helioscopes, and light-shining-through-a-wall experiments.",hep,hep-ph,Flavor Changing Neutral Higgs Couplings and Top-Charm Production at Next Linear Collider,"We explore the possibility of detecting flavor changing neutral Higgs couplings at the Next Linear Collider (NLC) through $e^+e^-\to \nu_e\bar{\nu_e} t\bar{c}$. In the framework of a general two-Higgs doublet model, we perform a complete calculation and find that $\sigma (e^+e^-\to \nu_e\nu_e t\bar{c}, \nu_e\bar{\nu_e} {\bar t}c)$ could reach $\sim 9$ fb for $\sqrt{s}=2 TeV$. This amounts to an annual production of 500 $t\bar{c}$ plus $\bar{t}c$ pairs at the NLC with an integrated luminosity of 50 fb$^{-1}$. The dependence of $tc$-production rate on the neutral scalar mixing angle is mild except when $\sin^2\alpha \to 0 or 1$. The $\nu\nu W^+W^-$ background should be manageable after $b$-tagging, while $\nu\nu t\bar t$ background should not be a problem when the signal event rate is still interesting. The process, together with $e^+e^-\to \nu_e\bar{\nu_e} W^+W^-, \nu_e\bar{\nu_e} ZZ$ studies, offer the chance of measuring the $t$-$c$-Higgs coupling.",hep,hep-ph,1
Soft gamma-ray constraints on a bright flare from the Galactic Center supermassive black hole,"Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the supermassive black hole residing at the center of the Milky Way. It has been the main target of an extensive multiwavelength campaign we carried out in April 2007. Herein, we report the detection of a bright flare from the vicinity of the horizon, observed simultaneously in X-rays (XMM/EPIC) and near infrared (VLT/NACO) on April 4th for 1-2 h. For the first time, such an event also benefitted from a soft gamma-rays (INTEGRAL/ISGRI) and mid infrared (VLT/VISIR) coverage, which enabled us to derive upper limits at both ends of the flare spectral energy distribution (SED). We discuss the physical implications of the contemporaneous light curves as well as the SED, in terms of synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton and external Compton emission processes.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Contrasting X-ray/UV time-lags in Seyfert 1 galaxies NGC 4593 and NGC 7469 using AstroSat observations,"We study accretion disk-corona connection in Seyfert 1 galaxies using simultaneous UV/X-ray observations of NGC 4593 (July 14-18, 2016) and NGC 7469 (October 15-19, 2017) performed with AstroSat. We use the X-ray (0.5-7.0 keV) data acquired with the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and the UV (FUV: 130-180 nm, NUV: 200-300 nm) data obtained with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). We also use the contemporaneous Swift observations of NGC 4593 and demonstrate AstroSat's capability for X-ray/UV correlation studies. We performed UV/X-ray cross-correlation analysis using the Interpolated and the Discrete Cross-Correlation Functions and found similar results. In the case of NGC 4593, we found that the variations in the X-rays lead to those in the FUV and NUV bands by ~ 38 ks and ~ 44 ks, respectively. These UV lags favour the disk reprocessing model, they are consistent with the previous results within uncertainties. In contrast, we found an opposite trend in NGC 7469 where the soft X-ray variations lag those in the FUV and NUV bands by ~ 41 ks and ~ 49 ks, respectively. The hard lags in NGC 7469 favour the Thermal Comptonization model. Our results may provide direct observational evidence for the variable intrinsic UV emission from the accretion disk which acts as the seed for thermal Comptonization in a hot corona in a lamp-post like geometry. The non-detection of disk reverberation photons in NGC 7469, using AstroSat data, is most likely due to a high accretion rate resulting in a hot accretion disk and large intrinsic emission.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Floquet edge solitons in modulated trimer waveguide arrays,"We show that one-dimensional Floquet trimer arrays with periodically oscillating waveguides support two different and co-existing types of topological Floquet edge states in two different topological gaps in Floquet spectrum. In these systems nontrivial topology is introduced by longitudinal periodic oscillations of the waveguide centers, leading to the formation of Floquet edge states in certain range of oscillation amplitudes despite the fact that the structure spends half of the period in ``instantaneously'' nontopological phase, and only during other half-period it is ``instantaneously'' topological. Two co-existing Floquet edge states are characterized by different phase relations between bright spots in the unit cell -- in one mode these spots are in-phase, while in other mode they are out-of-phase. We show that in focusing nonlinear medium topological Floquet edge solitons, representing exactly periodic nonlinear localized Floquet states, can bifurcate from both these types of linear edge states. Both types of Floquet edge solitons can be stable and can be created dynamically using two-site excitations.",physics,physics.optics,High power spatial single-mode quantum cascade lasers at 8.9 $\mu$m,"High performance of InP-based quantum cascade lasers emitting at $\lambda$ ~ 9$\mu$m are reported.

Isolating the chiral magnetic effect from backgrounds by pair invariant mass,"Topological gluon configurations in quantum chromodynamics induce quark chirality imbalance in local domains, which can result in the chiral magnetic effect (CME)--an electric charge separation along a strong magnetic field. Experimental searches for the CME in relativistic heavy ion collisions via the charge-dependent azimuthal correlator ($\Delta\gamma$) suffer from large backgrounds arising from particle correlations (e.g. due to resonance decays) coupled with the elliptic anisotropy. We propose differential measurements of the $\Delta\gamma$ as a function of the pair invariant mass ($m_{\rm inv}$), by restricting to high $m_{\rm inv}$ thus relatively background free, and by studying the $m_{\rm inv}$ dependence to separate the possible CME signal from backgrounds. We demonstrate by model studies the feasibility and effectiveness of such measurements for the CME search.",nucl,nucl-ex,"Beam energy dependence of cumulants of the net-baryon, net-charge and deuteron multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0-5.0$ GeV","Within the ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model, in which the Lorentz-covariant treatment of nuclear mean-field potential is considered, the fluctuations of net-baryon, net-charge and deuterons multiplicity distributions in Au+Au head-on collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0-5.0$ GeV are calculated. The results show that the nuclear mean-field potential can significantly enhance the magnitude of baryon number fluctuations in narrow rapidity windows, and this enhancement rapidly weakens with increasing beam energy. However, for proton and net-charge number fluctuations, the mean-field effects are less noticeable than that for baryon number. In addition, for net-charge number fluctuations, the negative binomial distribution agrees well with the calculated results at mid-pseudorapidity window. Finally, the event-by-event fluctuations of deuteron number in the coalescence production picture are calculated as well, it is found that its cumulant ratios decrease linearly with increasing the average multiplicity of deuterons per event, i.e., increase with increasing beam energy.",nucl,nucl-ex,1
Gravitino DM and high reheating temperatures after LHC 7/8,The presence of high reheating temperatures in the thermal history of the universe challenges supersymmetric scenarios owing to the gravitino problem. We revise a general R-parity conserving gravitino dark matter scenario with a stau as the next-to-lightest superparticle being particularly constrained by searches for heavy stable charged particles at the LHC. Imposing a variety of experimental and theoretical constraints we show that points with T_R > 10^9 GeV survive only in a very particular corner of parameter space.,hep,hep-ph,Flavor Neutrino Oscillations and Time-Energy Uncertainty Relation,We consider neutrino oscillations as non stationary phenomenon based on Schrodinger evolution equation and mixed states of neutrinos with definite flavors.

What do equitable physics lab groups look like in light of inchargeness?,"In physics labs, students experience a wide range of equitable and inequitable interactions. We developed a methodology to characterize different lab groups in terms of their bid exchanges and inchargeness. An equitable group is one in which every student's bids are heard and acknowledged.

We obtain with good accuracy the value of air permeability $\mu_{air}$. We also observe the same dependence of $B$ on $z$ when considering a magnet instead of a coil. Although our estimates are obtained through simple data fits, we also perform a more sophisticated error analysis, confirming the result for $\mu_{air}$.",physics,physics.ed-ph,1
A Near-Infrared Chemical Inventory of the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e,"We present high-resolution near-infrared spectra taken during eight transits of 55 Cancri e, a nearby low-density super-Earth with a short orbital period (< 18 hours). While this exoplanet's bulk density indicates a possible atmosphere, one has not been detected definitively. Our analysis relies on the Doppler cross-correlation technique, which takes advantage of the high spectral resolution and broad wavelength coverage of our data, to search for the thousands of absorption features from hydrogen-, carbon-, and nitrogen-rich molecular species in the planetary atmosphere. Although we are unable to detect an atmosphere around 55 Cancri e, we do place strong constraints on the levels of HCN, NH${}_3$, and C${}_2$H${}_2$ that may be present. In particular, at a mean molecular weight of 5 amu we can rule out the presence of HCN in the atmosphere down to a volume mixing ratio (VMR) of 0.02%, NH${}_3$ down to a VMR of 0.08%, and C${}_2$H${}_2$ down to a VMR of 1.0%. If the mean molecular weight is relaxed to 2 amu, we can rule out the presence of HCN, NH${}_3$, and C${}_2$H${}_2$ down to VMRs of 0.001%, 0.0025%, and 0.08% respectively. Our results reduce the parameter space of possible atmospheres consistent with the analysis of HST/WFC3 observations by Tsiaras et al. (2016), and indicate that if 55 Cancri e harbors an atmosphere, it must have a high mean molecular weight and/or clouds.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,Assessing $TESS$'s Yield of Rocky Planets Around Nearby M Dwarfs,"Terrestrial planets are easier to detect around M dwarfs than other types of stars, making them promising for next-generation atmospheric characterization studies. The $TESS$ mission has greatly increased the number of known M dwarf planets that we can use to perform population studies, allowing us to explore how the rocky planet occurrence rate varies with host radius, following in the footsteps of past work with $Kepler$ data. In this paper, we use simulations to assess $TESS$'s yield of small ($0.5\,R_\oplus \,<\,R_p\,<\,2\,R_\oplus$) planet candidates around nearby ($d\,<\,30$ pc) M dwarfs. We highlight the underappreciated fact that while $TESS$ was indeed expected to find a large number of planets around M dwarfs overall, it was not expected to have a high planetary yield for the latest M dwarfs. Furthermore, we find that $TESS$ has detected fewer planets around stars with $R_*\,<\,0.3 R_\odot$ than even was expected (11 observed vs. $24\,\pm\,5$ expected). We find evidence that the photometric noise of stars in the $TESS$ bandpass increases with decreasing radius for M dwarfs. However, this trend cannot explain the observed distribution of planets. Our main conclusions are: (1) the planet occurrence rate likely doesn't increase, and may decrease for the latest M dwarfs; and (2) there are at least 17, and potentially three times that number, transiting planets around nearby late M dwarfs that still won't be detected by the end of $TESS$'s 4th year.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,1
Terahertz Quantum Hall Effect in a Topological Insulator,"Using THz spectroscopy in external magnetic fields we investigate the low-temperature charge dynamics of strained HgTe, a three dimensional topological insulator. From the Faraday rotation angle and ellipticity a complete characterization of the charge carriers is obtained, including the 2D density, the scattering rate and the Fermi velocity. The obtained value of the Fermi velocity provides further evidence for the Dirac character of the carriers in the sample. In resonator experiments, we observe quantum Hall oscillations at THz frequencies. The 2D density estimated from the period of these oscillations agrees well with direct transport experiments on the topological surface state.

Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) VI: Kinematic Structures around the Very Low Mass Protostar IRAS 16253-2429,"Precise estimates of protostellar masses are crucial to characterize the formation of stars of low masses down to brown-dwarfs (BDs; M* < 0.08 Msun). The most accurate estimation of protostellar mass uses the Keplerian rotation in the circumstellar disk around the protostar. To apply the Keplerian rotation method to a protostar at the low-mass end, we have observed the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the 1.3 mm continuum at an angular resolution of 0.07"" (10 au), and in the 12CO, C18O, 13CO (J=2-1), and SO (J_N = 6_5-5_4) molecular lines, as part of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). The continuum emission traces a non-axisymmetric, disk-like structure perpendicular to the associated 12CO outflow. The position-velocity (PV) diagrams in the C18O and 13CO lines can be interpreted as infalling and rotating motions. In contrast, the PV diagram along the major axis of the disk-like structure in the 12CO line allows us to identify Keplerian rotation. The central stellar mass and the disk radius are estimated to be ~0.12-0.17 Msun and ~13-19 au, respectively. The SO line suggests the existence of an accretion shock at a ring (r~28 au) surrounding the disk and a streamer from the eastern side of the envelope. IRAS 16253-2429 is not a proto-BD but has a central stellar mass close to the BD mass regime, and our results provide a typical picture of such very low-mass protostars.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,The MOSDEF Survey: the Variation of the Dust Attenuation Curve with Metallicity,"We derive the UV-optical stellar dust attenuation curve of galaxies at z=1.4-2.6 as a function of gas-phase metallicity. We use a sample of 218 star-forming galaxies, excluding those with very young or heavily obscured star formation, from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey with H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and [NII]$\lambda 6585$ spectroscopic measurements. We constrain the shape of the attenuation curve by comparing the average flux densities of galaxies sorted into bins of dust obscuration using Balmer decrements, i.e., H$\alpha$-to-H$\beta$ luminosities. The average attenuation curve for the high-metallicity sample (12+log(O/H)>8.5, corresponding to $M_*\gtrsim10^{10.4}\,M_{\odot}$) has a shallow slope, identical to that of the Calzetti local starburst curve, and a significant UV 2175A extinction bump that is $\sim 0.5\times$ the strength of the Milky Way bump. On the other hand, the average attenuation curve of the low-metallicity sample (12+log(O/H) $\sim 8.2-8.5$) has a steeper slope similar to that of the SMC curve, only consistent with the Calzetti slope at the $3\sigma$ level. The UV bump is not detected in the low-metallicity curve, indicating the relative lack of the small dust grains causing the bump at low metallicities. Furthermore, we find that on average the nebular reddening (E(B-V)) is a factor of 2 times larger than that of the stellar continuum for galaxies with low metallicities, while the nebular and stellar reddening are similar for galaxies with higher metallicities. The latter is likely due to a high surface density of dusty clouds embedding the star forming regions but also reddening the continuum in the high-metallicity galaxies.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Constructing Hubbard Models for the Hydrogen Chain using Sliced Basis DMRG,"Sliced-basis DMRG(sb-DMRG) is used to simulate a chain of hydrogen atoms and to construct low-energy effective Hubbard-like models. The downfolding procedure first involves a change of basis to a set of atom-centered Wannier functions constructed from the natural orbitals of the exact DMRG one-particle density matrix. The Wannier function model is then reduced to a fewer-parameter Hubbard-like model, whose parameters are determined by minimizing the expectation value of the Wannier Hamiltonian in the ground state of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. This indirect variational procedure not only yields compact and simple models for the hydrogen chain, but also allows us to explore the importance of constraints in the effective Hamiltonian, such as the restricting the range of the single-particle hopping and two-particle interactions, and to assess the reliability of more conventional downfolding. The entanglement entropy for a model's ground state, cut in the middle, is an important property determining the ability of DMRG and tensor networks to simulate the model, and we study its variation with the range of the interactions. Counterintuitively, we find that shorter ranged interactions often have larger entanglement.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Vector chirality and inhomogeneous magnetization in frustrated spin tubes in high magnetic fields,"The low-energy physics of three-leg frustrated antiferromagnetic spin-S tubes in the vicinity of the upper critical field are studied. Utilizing the effective field theory based on the spin-wave approximation, we argue that in the intermediate-interchain-coupling regime, the ground state exhibits a vector chiral order or an inhomogeneous magnetization for the interchain (rung) direction and the low-energy excitations are described by a one-component Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL). In both chiral and inhomogeneous phases, the Z_2 parity symmetry along the rung direction is spontaneously broken. It is also predicted that a two-component TLL appears and all the symmetries are restored in the strong-rung-coupling case.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Minkowski Space Non-Abelian Classical Solutions with Non-Integer Winding Number Change,"Working in a spherically symmetric ansatz in Minkowski space we discover new solutions to the classical equations of motion of pure $SU(2)$ gauge theory. These solutions represent spherical shells of energy which at early times move inward near the speed of light, excite the region of space around the origin at intermediate times and move outward at late times. The solutions change the winding number in bounded regions centered at the origin by non-integer amounts. They also produce non-integer topological charge in these regions. We show that the previously discovered solutions of Luscher and Schechter also have these properties.",hep,hep-ph,Electroweak Penguin Effects In Some $B_s^0$ Two-Body Decays,"Using the next-to-leading order low energy effective Hamiltonian for $\Delta B=1$ transitions, the effects of electroweak penguin operators in some two-body decay modes of $B_s^0$ meson are estimated in the Standard Model (SM). We find that in $B_s^0\to\pi^+ K^-$ and $B_s^0\to K^+K^-$ decay modes, the electroweak penguin effects are small, while in $B_s^0\to\pi^0\bar{K^0}$, $\phi\bar{K^0}$, $\phi\phi$, the electroweak penguin operators enhance or reduce the pure QCD penguin and tree level contributions by $20%\sim 80%$ in decay width. We also present the results of CP asymmetries in these $B_s^0$ deacy modes.",hep,hep-ph,1
Inflation without Inflaton(s),"We propose a model for early universe cosmology without the need for fundamental scalar fields. Cosmic acceleration and phenomenologically viable reheating of the universe results from a series of energy transitions, where during each transition vacuum energy is converted to thermal radiation. We show that this `cascading universe' can lead to successful generation of adiabatic density fluctuations and an observable gravity wave spectrum in some cases, where in the simplest case it reproduces a spectrum similar to slow-roll models of inflation. We also find the model provides a reasonable reheating temperature after inflation ends. This type of model may also be relevant for addressing the smallness of the vacuum energy today.",hep,hep-th,Weyl-Dirac zero-mode for calorons,We give the analytic result for the fermion zero-mode of the SU(2) calorons with non-trivial holonomy. It is shown that the zero-mode is supported on ONLY ONE of the constituent monopoles. We discuss some of its implications.,hep,hep-th,1
Evolution of Primordial Magnetic Fields from Phase Transitions,"We consider the evolution of primordial magnetic fields generated during cosmological, electroweak or QCD, phase transitions. We assume that the magnetic field generation can be described as an injection of magnetic energy to cosmological plasma at a given scale determined by the moment of magnetic field generation. A high Reynolds number ensures strong coupling between magnetic field and fluid motions. The subsequent evolution of the magnetic field is governed by decaying hydromagnetic turbulence. Both our numerical simulations and a phenomenological description allow us to recover ""universal"" laws for the decay of magnetic energy and the growth of magnetic correlation length in the turbulent (low viscosity) regime. In particular, we show that during the radiation dominated epoch, energy and correlation length of non-helical magnetic fields scale as conformal time to the powers -1/2 and +1/2, respectively. For helical magnetic fields, energy and correlation length scale as conformal time to the powers -1/3 and +2/3, respectively. The universal decay law of the magnetic field implies that the strength of magnetic field generated during the QCD phase transition could reach $\sim 10^{-9}$\,G with the present day correlation length $\sim 50$ kpc. The fields generated at the electroweak phase transition could be as strong as $\sim 10^{-10}$ G with correlation lengths reaching $\sim 0.3$\,kpc. These values of the magnetic fields are consistent with the lower bounds of the extragalactic magnetic fields.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Testing Modified Newtonian dynamics through statistics of velocity dispersion profiles in the inner regions of elliptical galaxies,"Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) provides a paradigm alternative to dark matter that has been successful in fitting and predicting the rich phenomenology of rotating disc galaxies. There have also been attempts to test MOND in dispersion-supported early-type galaxies, but it remains unclear whether MOND can fit the various empirical properties of early-type galaxies. As a way of rigorously testing MOND in elliptical galaxies we calculate the MOND-predicted velocity dispersion profiles (VDPs) in the inner regions of $\sim 2000$ nearly round SDSS elliptical galaxies under a variety of assumptions on VD anisotropy, and then compare the predicted distribution of VDP slopes with the observed distribution in 11 ATLAS3d galaxies selected with essentially the same criteria. We find that the MOND model parameterised with an interpolating function that works well for rotating galaxies can also reproduce the observed distribution of VDP slopes based only on the observed stellar mass distribution without DM or any other galaxy-to-galaxy varying factor. This is remarkable in view that Newtonian dynamics with DM requires a specific amount and/or profile of DM for each galaxy in order to reproduce the observed distribution of VDP slopes. When we analyse non-round galaxy samples using the MOND-based spherical Jeans equation, we do not find any systematic difference in the mean property of the VDP slope distribution compared with the nearly round sample. However, in line with previous studies of MOND through individual analyses of elliptical galaxies, varying MOND interpolating function or VD anisotropy can lead to systematic change in the VDP slope distribution, indicating that a statistical analysis of VDPs can be used to constrain specific MOND models with an accurate measurement of VDP slopes or a prior constraint on VD anisotropy.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Time-dependent analysis of $B^0 \to {{K^0_{S}}} \pi^- \pi^+ \gamma$ decays and studies of the $K^+\pi^-\pi^+$ system in $B^+ \to K^+ \pi^- \pi^+ \gamma$ decays,"We measure the time-dependent $CP$ asymmetry in the radiative-penguin decay $B^0 \to {{K^0_{S}}} \pi^- \pi^+ \gamma$, using a sample of $471$ million $\Upsilon(4S) \to B{\kern 0.18em\overline{\kern -0.18em B}}$ events recorded with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$ storage ring at SLAC. Using events with $m_{K\pi\pi}<1.8{\mathrm{\,Ge\kern -0.1em V/}c^2}$, we measure the branching fractions of $B^+ \to K^+ \pi^- \pi^+ \gamma$ and $B^0 \to K^0 \pi^+ \pi^- \gamma$, the branching fractions of the kaonic resonances decaying to $K^+ \pi^- \pi^+$, as well as the overall branching fractions of the $B^+ \to \rho^0 K^+ \gamma$, $B^+ \to K^{*0} \pi^+ \gamma$ and S-wave $B^+ \to (K \pi)^{*0}_0 \pi^+ \gamma$ components. For events from the $\rho$ mass band, we measure the $CP$-violating parameters ${\mathcal{S}_{{{K^0_{S}}}\pi^+\pi^-\gamma}} = 0.14 \pm 0.25 \pm 0.03$ and ${\mathcal{C}_{{{K^0_{S}}}\pi^+\pi^-\gamma}} = -0.39 \pm 0.20^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. We extract from this measurement the time-dependent $CP$ asymmetry related to the $CP$ eigenstate $\rho^0 {{K^0_{S}}}$ and obtain ${\mathcal{S}_{{{K^0_{S}}}\rho\gamma}} = -0.18 \pm 0.32^{+ 0.06}_{-0.05}$, which provides information on the photon polarization in the underlying $b \to s \gamma$ transition.",hep,hep-ex,Extraction of neutron density distributions from high-statistics coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering data,"Forthcoming fixed-target coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments aim at measurements with $\cal{O}(\text{tonne})$-scale detectors and substantially reduced systematic and statistical uncertainties. With such high quality data, the extraction of point-neutron distributions mean-square radii requires a better understanding of possible theoretical uncertainties. We quantify the impact of single-nucleon electromagnetic mean-square radii on the weak-charge form factor and compare results from weak-charge form factor parametrizations and weak-charge form factor decompositions in terms of elastic vector proton and neutron form factors, including nucleon form factors $Q$-dependent terms up to order $Q^2$. We assess as well the differences arising from results derived using weak-charge form factor decompositions in terms of elastic vector proton and neutron form factors and a model-independent approach based solely on the assumption of spherically symmetric nuclear ground state. We demonstrate the impact of the main effects by assuming pseudo-data from a one-tonne LAr detector and find that, among the effects and under the assumptions considered in this paper, weak-charge form factor parametrizations and weak-charge form factor decompositions in terms of elastic vector proton and neutron form factors enable the extraction of the $^{40}\text{Ar}$ point-neutron distribution mean-square radius with a $\sim 15\%$ accuracy. With a substantial reduction of the beam-related neutron and steady-state backgrounds a $\sim 1\%$ precision extraction seems feasible, using either of the two approaches.",hep,hep-ex,1
Black holes in quartic-order beyond-generalized Proca theories,"The generalized Proca theories with second-order equations of motion can be healthily extended to a more general framework in which the number of propagating degrees of freedom remains unchanged. In the presence of a quartic-order nonminimal coupling to gravity arising in beyond-generalized Proca theories, the speed of gravitational waves $c_t$ on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological background can be equal to that of light $c$ under a certain condition. By using this condition alone, we show that the speed of gravitational waves in the vicinity of static and spherically symmetric black holes is also equivalent to $c$ for the propagation of odd-parity perturbations along both radial and angular directions. As a by-product, the black holes arising in our beyond-generalized Proca theories are plagued by neither ghost nor Laplacian instabilities against odd-parity perturbations. We show the existence of both exact and numerical black hole solutions endowed with vector hairs induced by the quartic-order coupling.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Theoretical priors in scalar-tensor cosmologies: Thawing quintessence,"The late time acceleration of the Universe can be characterized in terms of an extra, time dependent, component of the universe -- dark energy. The simplest proposal for dark energy is a scalar-tensor theory -- quintessence -- which consists of a scalar field, $\phi$, whose dynamics is solely dictated by its potential, $V(\phi)$. Such a theory can be uniquely characterized by the equation of state of the scalar field energy momentum-tensor. We find the time dependence of the equation of state for a broad family of potentials and, using this information, we propose an analytic prior distribution for the most commonly used parametrization. We show that this analytic prior can be used to accurately predict the distribution of observables for the next generation of cosmological surveys. Including the theoretical priors in the comparison with observations considerably improves the constraints on the equation of state.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Performance Studies of the ATLASpix HV-MAPS Prototype for Different Substrate Resistivities,"The ATLASpix high-voltage monolithic active pixel sensor (HV-MAPS) was designed as a technology demonstrator for the ATLAS ITk Upgrade and the CLIC tracking detector. In this contribution new results from laboratory-based energy calibration measurements using fluorescence X-rays are presented for the ATLASpix Simple matrix. These findings are complemented by new results from test-beam studies with inclined tracks, in which the active charge collection depth is determined.",hep,hep-ex,Novel T-Violation observable open to any pair of decay channels at meson factories,"Quantum Entanglement between the two neutral mesons produced in meson factories has allowed the first indisputable direct observation of Time Reversal Violation in the time evolution of the neutral meson between the two decays. The exceptional meson transitions are directly connected to semileptonic and CP-eigenstate decay channels. The possibility of extending the observable asymmetries to more decay channels confronts the problem of the ""orthogonality condition"", which can be stated with this tongue-twister: Given a decay channel $f$, Which is the decay channel $f'$ such that the meson state not decaying to $f'$ is orthogonal to the meson state not decaying to $f$? In this paper we propose an alternative $T$-Violation Asymmetry at meson factories which allows its opening to any pair of decay channels. Instead of searching which is the pair of decay channels associated to the $T$-reverse meson transition, we build an asymmetry which tags the initial states of both the Reference and the $T$-reverse meson transitions. This observable filters the appropriate final states by means of two measurable survival probabilities. We discuss the methodology to be followed in the analysis of the new observable and the results expected in specific examples.",hep,hep-ex,1
Anomalously Strong Nonlinearity of Unswept Quartz Acoustic Cavities at Liquid Helium Temperatures,"We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear phenomena at extremely low powers in cryogenic acoustic cavities fabricated from quartz material, which have not undergone any electrodiffusion processes. Nonlinear phenomena observed include lineshape discontinuities, power response discontinuities, quadrature oscillations and self-induced transparency. These phenomena are attributed to nonlinear dissipation through a large number of randomly distributed heavy trapped ions, which would normally be removed by electrodiffusion. A simple mean-field model predicts most of the observed phenomena. In contrast to Duffing-like systems, this system shows an unusual mechanism of nonlinearity, which is not related to crystal anharmonisity.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,Localization Length in Quasi One Dimensional Disordered System Revised,"In the weak disordered regime we provide analytical expressions for the electron localization lengths in quasi-one dimensional (Q1D) disordered quantum wire with hard wall and periodic boundary conditions. They are exact up to order $W^2$ ($W$ being the disorder strength) for an arbitrary number of channels. Detailed numerical analysis of the Anderson localization, based on Kubo's formula for conductivity, show excellent agreement with analytical calculations. We establish relationship between various lengths in Q1D systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,1
The phase-locked mean impulse response of a turbulent channel flow,"We describe the first DNS-based measurement of the complete mean response of a turbulent channel flow to small external disturbances. Space-time impulsive perturbations are applied at one channel wall, and the linear response describes their mean effect on the flow field as a function of spatial and temporal separations. The turbulent response is shown to differ from the response a laminar flow with the turbulent mean velocity profile as base flow.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,Non-Fickian macroscopic model of axial diffusion of granular materials in a long cylindrical tumbler,"We provide new concepts for understanding transport phenomena in flows of granular materials by using a non-Fickian macroscopic model of axial diffusion of a granular material in a finite cylindrical tumbler. The model accounts for diffusion induced by particle collisions only in a thin surface flowing layer due to localization of shear within the cross-section of the drum. All model parameters are related to measurable quantities in a granular flow. It is shown that the proposed model is a member of the general class of linear constitutive relations with memory. An exact solution for the spreading of a finite-width pulse initial condition under the proposed non-Fickian model is derived and compared to the solution of a Fickian model (i.e., the ``classical'' diffusion equation).",physics,physics.flu-dyn,1
Could bright gamma-ray burst optical transients have been recorded historically?,"The brightest optical flash from a gamma-ray burst (GRB) was, briefly, a naked-eye object. Several other GRBs have produced optical transients only slightly fainter. We argue that, based upon the recently accumulated data from hundreds of GRB transients, many such optical events should have been visible to the unaided eye in the course of human history. The most likely repositories of such observations are historical records from the Orient, and we have located and discuss a number of candidates. We also consider the value of such observations, should any very likely ones be uncovered, to modern astrophysics.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Serendipitous Science from the K2 Mission,"The K2 mission is a repurposed use of the Kepler spacecraft to perform high-precision photometry of selected fields in the ecliptic. We have developed an aperture photometry pipeline for K2 data which performs dynamic automated aperture mask selection, background estimation and subtraction, and positional decorrelation to minimize the effects of spacecraft pointing jitter. We also identify secondary targets in the K2 ""postage stamps"" and produce light curves for those targets as well. Pipeline results will be made available to the community. Here we describe our pipeline and the photometric precision we are capable of achieving with K2, and illustrate its utility with asteroseismic results from the serendipitous secondary targets.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Exploring dynamical magnetism with time-dependent density-functional theory: from spin fluctuations to Gilbert damping,"We use time-dependent spin-density-functional theory to study dynamical magnetic phenomena. First, we recall that the local-spin-density approximation (LSDA) fails to account correctly for magnetic fluctuations in the paramagnetic state of iron and other itinerant ferromagnets. Next, we construct a gradient-dependent density functional that does not suffer from this problem of the LSDA. This functional is then used to derive, for the first time, the phenomenological Gilbert equation of micromagnetics directly from time-dependent density-functional theory. Limitations and extensions of Gilbert damping are discussed on this basis, and some comparisons with phenomenological theories and experiments are made.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Weighted network modules,"The inclusion of link weights into the analysis of network properties allows a deeper insight into the (often overlapping) modular structure of real-world webs. We introduce a clustering algorithm (CPMw, Clique Percolation Method with weights) for weighted networks based on the concept of percolating k-cliques with high enough intensity. The algorithm allows overlaps between the modules. First, we give detailed analytical and numerical results about the critical point of weighted k-clique percolation on (weighted) Erdos-Renyi graphs. Then, for a scientist collaboration web and a stock correlation graph we compute three-link weight correlations and with the CPMw the weighted modules. After reshuffling link weights in both networks and computing the same quantities for the randomised control graphs as well, we show that groups of 3 or more strong links prefer to cluster together in both original graphs.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
Scheme Dependence in Polarized Deep Inelastic Scattering,We study the effect of scheme dependence upon the NLO QCD analysis of the world data on polarized DIS. The reliability of an analysis at NLO is demonstrated by the consistency of our polarized densities with the NLO transformation rules relating them to each other. We stress the importance of the chiral JET scheme in which all the hard effects are consistently absorbed in the Wilson coefficient functions.,hep,hep-ph,Symmetries of hadrons after unbreaking the chiral symmetry,"We study hadron correlators upon artificial restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. In a dynamical lattice simulation we remove the lowest lying eigenmodes of the Dirac operator from the valence quark propagators and study evolution of the hadron masses obtained. All mesons and baryons in our study, except for a pion, survive unbreaking the chiral symmetry and their exponential decay signals become essentially better. From the analysis of the observed spectroscopic patterns we conclude that confinement still persists while the chiral symmetry is restored. All hadrons fall into different chiral multiplets. The broken U(1)_A symmetry does not get restored upon unbreaking the chiral symmetry. We also observe signals of some higher symmetry that includes chiral symmetry as a subgroup. Finally, from comparison of the \Delta - N splitting before and after unbreaking of the chiral symmetry we conclude that both the color-magnetic and the flavor-spin quark-quark interactions are of equal importance.",hep,hep-ph,1
The Left-Right Symmetric Composite Higgs,"We find the exchange symmetry between left and right handed top quark in composite Higgs model with partial compositeness is efficient to soften the Higgs potential and reduce fine tuning. This symmetry can keep the Higgs potential in top sector invariant under trigonometric parity $\sin (h/f) \leftrightarrow \cos (h/f)$ and thus the Higgs quadratic divergences can be completely cancelled, resulting a UV insensitive Higgs potential. We explicitly construct the minimal left-right symmetric model based on coset space $SO(6)/SO(5)$ which is locally isomorphic to $SU(4)/Sp(4)$ and thus has well defined fermionic UV completion. This UV completion can automatically keep Higgs potential in gauge sector finite even the gauge sector breaks this discrete symmetry. We find that the vector mesons can be very heavy while the colored top partners are relatively light ($>1.5$ TeV) to obtain a light Higgs.",hep,hep-ph,Dependence of elastic hadron collisions on impact parameter,"Elastic proton-proton collisions represent probably the greatest ensemble of available measured data, the analysis of which may provide large amount of new physical results concerning fundamental particles. It is, however, necessary to analyze first some conclusions concerning pp collisions and their interpretations differing fundamentally from our common macroscopic experience. It has been argued, e.g., that elastic hadron collisions have been more central than inelastic ones, even if any explanation of the existence of so different process, i.e., elastic and inelastic (with hundreds of secondary particles) collisions, under the same conditions has not been given until now. The given conclusion has been based on a greater number of simplifying mathematical assumptions (done already in earlier calculations), without their influence on physical interpretation being analyzed and entitled; the corresponding influence has started to be studied in the approach based on eikonal model. The possibility of peripheral interpretation of elastic collisions will be demonstrated and corresponding results summarized. The arguments will be given why no preference may be given to the mentioned centrality against the standard peripheral behaviour. The corresponding discussion of contemporary description of elastic hadronic collision in dependence on impact parameter will be summarized and the justification of some important assumptions will be considered.",hep,hep-ph,1
Quantum Feedback Cooling of a Mechanical Oscillator Using Variational Measurements:Tweaking Heisenberg's Microscope,"We revisit the problem of preparing a mechanical oscillator in the vicinity of its quantum-mechanical ground state by means of feedback cooling based on continuous optical detection of the oscillator position. In the parameter regime relevant to ground state cooling, the optical back-action and imprecision noise set the bottleneck of achievable cooling and must be carefully balanced. This can be achieved by adapting the phase of the local oscillator in the homodyne detection realizing a so-called variational measurement. The trade-off between accurate position measurement and minimal disturbance can be understood in terms of Heisenberg's microscope and becomes particularly relevant when the measurement and feedback processes happen to be fast within the quantum coherence time of the system to be cooled. This corresponds to the regime of large quantum cooperativity $C_{\text{q}}\gtrsim1$, which was achieved in recent experiments on feedback cooling. Our method provides a simple path to further pushing the limits of current state-of-the-art experiments in quantum optomechanics.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Tunable sign change of spin Hall magnetoresistance in Pt/NiO/YIG structures,"Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) has been investigated in Pt/NiO/YIG structures in a wide range of temperature and NiO thickness. The SMR shows a negative sign below a temperature which increases with the NiO thickness. This is contrary to a conventional SMR theory picture applied to Pt/YIG bilayer which always predicts a positive SMR. The negative SMR is found to persist even when NiO blocks the spin transmission between Pt and YIG, indicating it is governed by the spin current response of NiO layer. We explain the negative SMR by the NiO 'spin-flop' coupled with YIG, which can be overridden at higher temperatures by positive SMR contribution from YIG. This highlights the role of magnetic structure in antiferromagnets for transport of pure spin current in multilayers.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Scheme Transformations in the Vicinity of an Infrared Fixed Point,We analyze the effect of scheme transformations in the vicinity of an exact or approximate infrared fixed point in an asymptotically free gauge theory with fermions. We show that there is far less freedom in carrying out such scheme transformations in this case than at an ultraviolet fixed point. We construct a transformation from the $\bar{MS}$ scheme to a scheme with a vanishing three-loop term in the $\beta$ function and use this to assess the scheme dependence of an infrared fixed point in SU($N$) theories with fermions. Implications for the anomalous dimension of the fermion bilinear operator are also discussed.,hep,hep-th,Large N corrections to the strong coupling behaviour of SU(N)/Z_N lattice gauge theories,"We derive a formula for the large N behaviour of the expectation values of an arbitrary product of Wilson loops in the adjoint representation. We show the consequences of our formula for the study of the large N strong coupling behaviour of SU(N)/Z_N pure gauge theories, and theories with matter fields in the adjoint representation. This allows us to calculate large N corrections to the gluino condensate and meson propagators in the lattice version of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills. Applications to the strong coupling behaviour of the Kazakov-Migdal model are also given.",hep,hep-th,1
"On the BLM scale-fixing procedure, its generalizations and ""genuine"" higher order corrections",The question of the uniqueness of the Brodsky--Lepage--Mackenzie procedure for fixing the renormalization scale in perturbative QCD is discussed. It is shown that the resulting finite order approximants are as ambiguous as the original truncated perturbative expansions. This inherent ambiguity of the BLM procedure undermines the recent attempts to define ``genuine'' higher order perturbative corrections.,hep,hep-ph,Cosmological evolution of interacting dark energy in Lorentz violation,"The cosmological evolution of an interacting scalar field model in which the scalar field interacts with dark matter, radiation, and baryon via Lorentz violation is investigated. We propose a model of interaction through the effective coupling $\bar{\beta}$. Using dynamical system analysis, we study the linear dynamics of an interacting model and show that the dynamics of critical points are completely controlled by two parameters. Some results can be mentioned as follows. Firstly, the sequence of radiation, the dark matter, and the scalar field dark energy exist and baryons are sub dominant. Secondly, the model also allows the possibility of having a universe in the phantom phase with constant potential. Thirdly, the effective gravitational constant varies with respect to time through $\bar{\beta}$. In particular, we consider a simple case where $\bar{\beta}$ has a quadratic form and has a good agreement with the modified $\Lambda$CDM and quintessence models. Finally, we also calculate the first post--Newtonian parameters for our model.",hep,hep-ph,1
The $1/N_c$ expansion in hadron effective field theory,"We study the $N_c$ scalings of pion-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon scatterings and find that a consistent large $N_c$ counting can be established if we assume Witten's counting rules are applied to matrix elements or scattering amplitudes which use the relativistic normalization for the nucleons. With the pionless effective field theory, we also find that the $S$-wave nucleon-nucleon interaction is so strong that it should be treated nonperturbatively at the leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion. By summing all the leading order diagrams, we find that the deuteron binding energy is of order $1/N_c$. In contrast, meson-meson interaction is so weak that loosely-bound meson-meson molecular states may not exist in the large $N_c$ limit.",nucl,nucl-th,Superscaling of Inclusive Electron Scattering from Nuclei,"We investigate the degree to which the concept of superscaling, initially developed within the framework of the relativistic Fermi gas model, applies to inclusive electron scattering from nuclei. We find that data obtained from the low energy loss side of the quasielastic peak exhibit the superscaling property, i.e., the scaling functions f(\psi') are not only independent of momentum transfer (the usual type of scaling: scaling of the first kind), but coincide for A \geq 4 when plotted versus a dimensionless scaling variable \psi' (scaling of the second kind). We use this behavior to study as yet poorly understood properties of the inclusive response at large electron energy loss.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Diffuse Galactic Gamma Rays at intermediate and high latitudes. I. Constraints on the ISM properties,"We study the high latitude (|b|>10) diffuse gamma-ray emission in the Galaxy in light of the recently published data from the Fermi collaboration at energies between 100 MeV and 100 GeV. The unprecedented accuracy in these measurements allows to probe and constrain the properties of sources and propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) in the Galaxy, as well as confirming conventional assumptions made on the interstellar medium (ISM). Using the publicly available DRAGON code, that has been shown to reproduce local measurements of CRs, we study assumptions made in the literature on HI and H2 gas distributions in the ISM, and non spatially uniform models of diffusion in the Galaxy. By performing a combined analysis of CR and gamma-ray spectra, we derive constraints on the properties of the ISM gas distribution and the vertical scale height of galactic CR diffusion, which may have implications also on indirect Dark Matter detection. We also discuss some of the possible interpretations of the break at ~230 GV in CR protons and helium spectra, recently observed by PAMELA and their impact on gamma-rays.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Broadband X-Ray Observations of the 2018 Outburst of the Changing-Look Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 1566,"We study the nature of the changing-look Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 1566 during its June 2018 outburst. During the outburst, the X-ray intensity of the source rises up to ~25-30 times compared to its quiescent state intensity. We perform timing and spectral analysis of the source during pre-outburst, outburst, and post-outburst epochs using semi-simultaneous observations with the XMM-Newton, Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), and Neil Gehrels Swift Observatories. We calculate variance, normalized variance, and fractional rms amplitude in different energy bands to study the variability. The broad-band 0.5-70 keV spectra are fitted with phenomenological models, as well as physical models. A strong soft X-ray excess is detected in the spectra during the outburst. The soft excess emission is found to be complex and could originate in the warm Comptonizing region in the inner accretion disc. We find that the increase in the accretion rate is responsible for the sudden rise in luminosity. This is supported by the q-shape of the hardness-intensity diagram that is generally found in outbursting black hole X-ray binaries. From our analysis, we find that NGC 1566 most likely harbours a low-spinning black hole with the spin parameter a* ~ 0.2. We also discuss a scenario where the central core of NGC 1566 could be a merging supermassive black hole.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Localization Transition in a Ballistic Quantum Wire,"The many-body wave-function of an interacting one-dimensional electron system is probed, focusing on the low-density, strong interaction regime. The properties of the wave-function are determined using tunneling between two long, clean, parallel quantum wires in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, allowing for gate-controlled electron density. As electron density is lowered to a critical value the many-body state abruptly changes from an extended state with a well-defined momentum to a localized state with a wide range of momentum components. The signature of the localized states appears as discrete tunneling features at resonant gate-voltages, corresponding to the depletion of single electrons and showing Coulomb-blockade behavior. Typically 5-10 such features appear, where the one-electron state has a single-lobed momentum distribution, and the few-electron states have double-lobed distributions with peaks at $\pm k_F$. A theoretical model suggests that for a small number of particles (N<6), the observed state is a mixture of ground and thermally excited spin states.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Bilayer Insulator Tunnel Barriers for Graphene-Based Vertical Hot-electron Transistors,"Vertical graphene-based device concepts that rely on quantum mechanical tunneling are intensely being discussed in literature for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. In this work, the carrier transport mechanisms in semiconductor-insulator-graphene (SIG) capacitors are investigated with respect to their suitability as the electron emitter in vertical graphene base transistors (GBTs). Several dielectric materials as tunnel barriers are compared, including dielectric double layers. Using bilayer dielectrics, we experimentally demonstrate significant improvements in the electron injection current by promoting Fowler-Nordheim tunneling (FNT) and step tunneling (ST) while suppressing defect mediated carrier transports. High injected tunneling current densities approaching 10$^3$ A/cm$^2$ (limited by series resistance), and excellent current-voltage nonlinearity and asymmetry are achieved using a 1 nm-thick high quality dielectric, thulium silicate (TmSiO), as the first insulator layer, and titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) as a high electron affinity second layer insulator. We also confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach in a full GBT structure which shows dramatic improvement in the collector on-state current density with respect to the previously reported GBTs. The device design and the fabrication scheme have been selected with future CMOS process compatibility in mind. This work proposes a bilayer tunnel barrier approach as a promising candidate to be used in high performance vertical graphene-based tunneling devices.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Low-energy effective action for pions and a dilatonic meson,"Numerical simulations of QCD-like theories in which the number of flavors is adjusted so that the beta function is very small, but confinement and chiral symmetry breaking nevertheless take place, appear to reveal the presence of a flavor-singlet scalar meson which can be as light as the pions. Because the breaking of dilatation symmetry, quantified by the beta function, is small relative to QCD, a possible explanation is that the scalar meson is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the approximate dilatation symmetry. We use this observation to systematically develop a low-energy effective action that accounts for both the pions and the ""dilatonic"" scalar meson. In order to justify the power counting that controls the couplings of the dilatonic meson we invoke the Veneziano limit, in which the number of fundamental-representation flavors $N_f$ grows in proportion with the number of colors $N_c$, while the ratio $N_f/N_c$ is kept close to, but below, the critical value where the conformal window is entered.",hep,hep-th,Quantization of Fields by Averaging Classical Evolution Equations,"This paper extends the formalism for quantizing field theories via a microcanonical quantum field theory and Hamilton's principle to classical evolution equations. These are based on the well-known correspondence under a Wick rotation between quantum field theories and 4-D statistical mechanical theories. By placing quantum field theories on a 4+1-D under Wick rotation to 5-D, expectations of observables are calculated for a microcanonical field theory averaging Hamiltonian flow over a fifth spacelike dimension, a technique common in lattice gauge simulations but not in perturbation theory. In a novel demonstration, averaging pairs of external lines in the classical Feynman diagrams over the fifth dimension generates diagrams with loops and vacuum fluctuations identical to Standard Model diagrams. Because it is microcanonical, this approach, while equivalent for standard quantum fields theories in the Standard Model, is able to quantize theories that have no canonical quantization. It is also unique in representing expectations as averages over solutions to an ordinary, classical PDE rather than a path integral or operator based approaches. Hence, this approach draws a clear connection between quantum field theory and classical field theory in higher dimensions which has implications towards how quantum effects are interpreted. In particular, it raises questions about how violations of the ergodic hypothesis could influence quantum measurements even in standard, non-statistical quantum field theory.",hep,hep-th,1
Abelian Projections and Monopoles,"The monopole confinement mechanism in the abelian projection of lattice gluodynamics is reviewed. The main topics are: the abelian projection on the lattice and in the continuum, a numerical study of the abelian monopoles in the lattice gauge theory. Additionally, we briefly review the notation of differential forms, duality, and the BKT transformation in the lattice gauge theories.",hep,hep-ph,Hot and dense matter: from RHIC to LHC: Theoretical overview,"Relativistic heavy ion physics studies the phenomena that occur when a very large (in units of QCD scale $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$) amount of energy is deposited into a large (in units of $\Lambda^{-3}_{\rm QCD}$) volume, creating an extended in space and time domain with an energy density that is large in units of $\Lambda^{4}_{\rm QCD}$. This includes the mechanism by which the energy is deposited (likely a transformation of the colliding Lorentz-contracted ""gluon walls"" into the strong longitudinal color fields); approach to thermalization; and the static and dynamical properties of the created quark-gluon plasma. Of particular interest is the fate of symmetries (e.g. chiral $SU_L(3) \times SU_R(3)$, scale, and discrete ${\cal P}$ and ${\cal CP}$ invariances) in hot and dense QCD matter. At present, the program at RHIC has entered a stage where new discoveries are enabled by high precision of the measurements; moreover, an array of new capabilities will soon be available due to the numerous and significant upgrades. Very importantly, we will soon have access to unprecedented energies of colliding ions at the LHC. In addition, future RHIC runs at low energies, FAIR at GSI and NICA at JINR will make possible the studies of QCD matter at high baryon density. I will describe the current status of theoretical knowledge about hot QCD, and the ways in which it may be expected to improve in the near future.",hep,hep-ph,1
Integration of Superforms and Super-Thom Class,"We address the basic problem of constructing the Thom class for a supermanifold. Given a cohomological class of a supermanifold and the restriction of the supermanifold to its bosonic submanifold, the Thom class gives a prescription to define the integral over the bosonic submanifold in terms of the integral over the entire supermanifold. In addition, we provide some new interesting examples of supermanifolds obtained by extending a given bosonic manifold, we discuss the construction of superforms of special type (which transform as Berezinian under change of supercoordinates) and we define the de Rham cohomology. We review the construction of the Thom class in the conventional geometry and we discuss the extension to the supermanifolds. Then, we compute explicitly the Thom class for the case of CP^{(1|2)} and, as expected, the result is singular. We provide a regularization technique to handle the fermionic Thom class in practical applications. We conclude with some remarks about Calabi-Yau spaces and their embedding into super-CY.",hep,hep-th,Dissipative effects in finite density holographic superfluids,"We derive the leading dissipative corrections of holographic superfluids at finite temperature and chemical potential by employing our recently developed techniques to study dissipative effects in the hydrodynamic limit of holographic theories. As part of our results, we express the incoherent conductivity, the shear and the three bulk viscosities in terms of thermodynamics and the black hole horizon data of the dual bulk geometries. We use our results to show that all three bulk viscosities exhibit singular behaviour close to the critical point.",hep,hep-th,1
Optimizing microlens arrays for incoherent HiLo microscopy,"HiLo microscopy is a powerful, low-cost, and easily configurable technique for acquiring high-contrast optically-sectioned images. However, traditional HiLo microscopes are based on coherent light sources with diffusive glass plates or incoherent light sources with digital mirror devices (DMD) and spatial light modulators (SLM), which are more expensive. Here, we propose a new low-cost HiLo microscopy technique using MLAs and incoherent LED light sources. We simulated structured illumination (SI) patterns and HiLo image generation based on Fresnel diffraction and incoherent imaging. To observe how MLAs affect HiLo images, we used three common MLAs with specific microlens pitch and numerical aperture (NA) to generate periodic illumination patterns. According to our simulations, using MLAs and incoherent light sources can enhance the image contrast compared with a traditional widefield fluorescence microscope. We found that the MLA NA does not significantly affect HiLo images. A larger lens pitch can bring a higher image contrast. However, there is an optimized lens pitch. If the lens pitch is too high, artefacts are observed in HiLo images. To our knowledge, this is the first numerical study about MLA-based HiLo microscopy. This study can benefit researchers using MLAs and incoherent light sources to configure their low-cost HiLo microscopes.",physics,physics.optics,Reflectionless and invisible potentials in photonic lattices,"An arbitrarily-shaped optical potential on a discrete photonic lattice, which transversely drifts at a speed larger than the maximum one allowed by the light cone of the lattice band, becomes reflectionless. Such an intriguing result, which arises from the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice, is peculiar to discretized light and does not have any counterpart for light scattering in continuous optical media. A drifting non-Hermitian optical potential of the Kramers-Kronig type is also an invisible potential, i.e. a discrete optical beam crosses the drifting potential without being distorted, delayed nor advanced.",physics,physics.optics,1
Determining key spin-orbitronic parameters by means of propagating spin waves,"We characterize spin wave propagation and its modification by an electrical current in Permalloy(Py)/Pt bilayers with Py thickness between 4 and 20 nm. First, we analyze the frequency non-reciprocity of surface spin waves and extract from it the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction constant $D_s$ accounting for an additional contribution due to asymmetric surface anisotropies. Second, we measure the spin-wave relaxation rate and deduce from it the Py/Pt spin mixing conductance $g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{eff}$. Last, applying a \textit{dc} electrical current, we extract the spin Hall conductivity $\sigma_{SH}$ from the change of spin wave relaxation rate due to the spin-Hall spin transfer torque. We obtain a consistent picture of the spin wave propagation data for different film thicknesses using a single set of parameters $D_s=0.25$ pJ/m, $g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{eff} = 3.2\times 10^{19}$ m$^{-2}$ and $\sigma_{SH}=4\times10^{5}$ S/m.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Magnetostriction of metals with small Fermi-surface pockets: the case of the topologically trivial semimetal LuAs,"We develop a theory of the magnetostriction for metals with small charge-carrier pockets of their Fermi surfaces. As an example, we consider LuAs that has a cubic crystal structure. The theory quite well describes the known experimental data on the magnetostriction of this metal. The obtained results also clearly demonstrate that the dilatometry can be used for detecting tiny Fermi-surface pockets that are not discerned by traditional methods based on investigations of the Shubnikov--de Haas and de Haas--van Alphen effects.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Molecular studies of Planetary Nebulae,"Circumstellar envelopes (CEs) around evolved stars are an active site for the production of molecules. After evolving through the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), proto-planetary nebula (PPN), to planetary nebula (PN) phases, CEs ultimately merge with the interstellar medium (ISM). The study of molecules in PNe, therefore, is essential to understanding the transition from stellar to interstellar materials. So far, over 20 molecular species have been discovered in PNe. The molecular composition of PNe is rather different from those of AGB and PPNe, suggesting that the molecules synthesized in PN progenitors have been heavily processed by strong ultraviolet radiation from the central star. Intriguingly, fullerenes and complex organic compounds having aromatic and aliphatic structures can be rapidly formed and largely survive during the PPN/PN evolution. The similar molecular compositions in PNe and diffuse clouds as well as the detection of C$_{60}^+$ in the ISM reinforce the view that the mass-loss from PNe can significantly enrich the ISM with molecular species, some of which may be responsible for the diffuse interstellar bands. In this contribution, I briefly summarize some recent observations of molecules in PNe, with emphasis on their implications on circumstellar chemistry.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,"Statistical Prediction of [CII] Observations by Constructing Probability Density Functions using SOFIA, Herschel, and Spitzer Observations","We present a statistical algorithm for predicting the [CII] emission from Herschel and Spitzer continuum images using probability density functions between the [CII] emission and continuum emission. The [CII] emission at 158 $\mu$m is a critical tracer in studying the life cycle of interstellar medium and galaxy evolution. Unfortunately, its frequency is in the far infrared (FIR), which is opaque through the troposphere and cannot be observed from the ground except for highly red-shifted sources (z $\gtrsim$ 2). Typically [CII] observations of closer regions have been carried out using suborbital or space observatories. Given the high cost of these facilities and limited time availability, it is important to have highly efficient observations/operations in terms of maximizing science returns. This requires accurate prediction of the strength of emission lines and, therefore, the time required for their observation. However, [CII] emission has been hard to predict due to a lack of strong correlations with other observables. Here we adopt a new approach to making accurate predictions of [CII] emission by relating this emission simultaneously to several tracers of dust emission in the same region. This is done using a statistical methodology utilizing probability density functions (PDFs) among [CII] emission and Spitzer IRAC and Herschel PACS/SPIRE images. Our test result toward a star-forming region, RCW 120, demonstrates that our methodology delivers high-quality predictions with less than 30\% uncertainties over 80\% of the entire observation area, which is more than sufficient to test observation feasibility and maximize science return. The {\it pickle} dump files storing the PDFs and trained neural network module are accessible upon request and will support future far-infrared missions, for example, GUSTO and FIR Probe.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
The various accretion modes of AM Herculis: Clues from multi-wavelength observations in high accretion states,"We report on XMM-Newton and NuSTAR X-ray observations of the prototypical polar, AM Herculis, supported by ground-based photometry and spectroscopy, all obtained in high accretion states. In 2005, AM Herculis was in its regular mode of accretion, showing a self-eclipse of the main accreting pole. X-ray emission during the self-eclipse was assigned to a second pole through its soft X-ray emission and not to scattering. In 2015, AM Herculis was in its reversed mode with strong soft blobby accretion at the far accretion region. The blobby acretion region was more luminous than the other, persistently accreting, therefore called main region. Hard X-rays from the main region did not show a self-eclipse indicating a pronounced migration of the accretion footpoint. Extended phases of soft X-ray extinction through absorption in interbinary matter were observed for the first time in AM Herculis. The spectral parameters of a large number of individual soft flares could be derived. Simultaneous NuSTAR observations in the reversed mode of accretion revealed clear evidence for Compton reflection of radiation from the main pole at the white dwarf surface. This picture is supported by the trace of the Fe resonance line at 6.4 keV through the whole orbit. Highly ionized oxygen lines observed with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) were tentatively located at the bottom of the accretion column, although the implied densities are quite different from expectations. In the regular mode of accretion, the phase-dependent modulations in the ultraviolet (UV) are explained with projection effects of an accretion-heated spot at the prime pole. In the reversed mode projection effects cannot be recognized. The light curves reveal an extra source of UV radiation and extended UV absorbing dips.

They are diffuse nebulae that emit nonthermal radiation. Pulsar winds, relativistic magnetized outflows from the central star, shocked in the ambient medium produce a multiwavelength emission from the radio through gamma rays. Although the leptonic scenario is able to explain most PWNe emission, a hadronic contribution cannot be excluded. A possible hadronic contribution to the high-energy gamma-ray emission inevitably leads to the production of neutrinos. Using 9.5 yr of all-sky IceCube data, we report results from a stacking analysis to search for neutrino emission from 35 PWNe that are high-energy gamma-ray emitters. In the absence of any significant correlation, we set upper limits on the total neutrino emission from those PWNe and constraints on hadronic spectral components.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
The correspondence between long-range and short-range spin glasses,"We compare the critical behavior of the short-range Ising spin glass with a spin glass with long-range interactions which fall off as a power sigma of the distance. We show that there is a value of sigma of the long-range model for which the critical behavior is very similar to that of the short-range model in four dimensions. We also study a value of sigma for which we find the critical behavior to be compatible with that of the three dimensional model, though we have much less precision than in the four-dimensional case.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Flux fluctuations in a multi-random-walker model and surface growth dynamics,"We study the dynamics of visitation flux in a multi-random-walker model by comparison to surface growth dynamics in which one random walker drops a particle to a node at each time the walker visits the node. In each independent experiment (trial or day) for the multi-random-walker model, the number of walkers are randomly chosen from the uniform distribution $[< N_{RW} > -\triangle N_{RW}, < N_{RW} > +\triangle N_{RW} ]$. The averaged fluctuation $\bar {\sigma} ({T_{RW}})$ of the visitations over all nodes $i$ and independent experiments is shown to satisfy the power-law dependence on the walk step $T_{RW}$ as $\bar {\sigma} ({T_{RW}})\simeq {T_{RW}}^\beta$. Furthermore two distinct values of the exponent $\beta$ are found on a scale-free network, a random network and regular lattices. One is $\beta_i$, which is equal to the growth exponent $\beta$ for the surface fluctuation $W$ in one-random-walker model, and the other is $\beta=1$. $\beta_i$ is found for small $\triangle N_{RW}$ or for the system governed by the internal intrinsic dynamics. In contrast $\beta=1$ is found for large $\triangle N_{RW}$ or for the system governed by the external flux variations. The implications of our results to the recent studies on fluctuation dynamics of the nodes on networks are discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
The Star Formation Histories of Local Group Dwarf Galaxies II. Searching For Signatures of Reionization,"We search for signatures of reionization in the star formation histories (SFHs) of 38 Local Group dwarf galaxies (10$^4$ $<$ M$_{\star}$ $<$ 10$^9$ M$_{\odot}$). The SFHs are derived from color-magnitude diagrams using archival Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 imaging. Only five quenched galaxies (And V, And VI, And XIII, Leo IV, Hercules) are consistent with forming the bulk of their stars before reionization, when full uncertainties are considered. Observations of 13 of the predicted `true fossils' identified by Bovill & Ricotti show that only two (Hercules and Leo IV) indicate star formation quenched by reionization. However, both are within the virial radius of the Milky Way and evidence of tidal disturbance complicates this interpretation. We argue that the late-time gas capture scenario posited by Ricotti for the low mass, gas-rich, and star-forming fossil candidate Leo T is observationally indistinguishable from simple gas retention. Given the ambiguity between environmental effects and reionization, the best reionization fossil candidates are quenched low mass field galaxies (e.g., KKR 25).",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Formation and Abundance of Late Forming Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter,"We propose a novel mechanism where Primordial Black Hole (PBH) dark matter is formed much later in the history of the universe between the epoch of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon decoupling. In our setup, one does not need to modify the scale-invariant inflationary power spectra; instead, a late phase transition in strongly interacting fermion-scalar fluid (which naturally occurs around red-shift $ 10^6 \leq \, z_{\scriptscriptstyle T} \, \leq 10^8$ ) creates an instability in the density perturbation as sound speed turns imaginary. As a result, the dark matter perturbation grows exponentially in sub-Compton scales. This follows the immediate formation of early dense dark matter halo, which finally evolves into PBH due to cooling through scalar radiation. We calculate the variance of the density perturbations and PBH fractional abundances $f(M)$ by using a non-monochromatic mass function. We find the peak of our PBH mass function lies between $10^{-16} - 10^{-14}$ solar mass for $ z_{\scriptscriptstyle T} \simeq 10^6$, and thus it can be the entire dark matter of the universe. In PBH formation, one would expect a temporary phase where an attractive scalar balances the Fermi pressure. We numerically confirm that such a state indeed exists, and we find the radius and density profile of the temporary static structure of the dark matter halo, which finally evolves to PBH due to cooling through scalar radiation.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Direct micro-structuring of Si(111) surfaces through nanosecond-laser Bessel beams,"We present here a nanosecond laser ablation of Si(111) wafer with diffraction-free (Bessel-$J_0$) beams. First, the Axicon a conical shaped optical element for beam shaping is characterized with a visible and infrared light sources. Then, ablation profiles are obtained with Bessel beams generated for $\alpha=1^{\circ}$ and $\alpha=20^{\circ}$ base angles, then they are characterized via a Scanning Electron, an Atomic Force and an Optical Interferometric Microscopes. Experimental results compared with theoretical predictions obtained by using Bessel functions. Results show that Bessel beams give possibility of straightforward micro-structuring of Si(111) samples because the only central spot of Bessel beams could damage the surface provided that the laser pulse energy becomes in energy-range we found in our experiments. Moreover, our results clearly indicate that reduced HAZ area due to thermal expansion in ns pulse regime are natural outcome of Bessel beams as opposed to Gauss beams of same spot size. Lastly, nanosecond pulses indicate two-ablation regimes regarding the pulse energy, the quality of structures can be enhanced by using high quality Gauss beams ($M^{2}\approx1$) and the size of fabricated structures can be much reduced by using larger base angle of Axicon (such as $\alpha=40^{\circ}$) in our scheme.",physics,physics.optics,Ultrashort pulse generation from a graphene-coupled passively mode-locked terahertz laser,"The generation of stable trains of ultra-short (fs-ps), terahertz (THz)-frequency radiation pulses, with large instantaneous intensities, is an underpinning requirement for the investigation of light-matter interactions, for metrology and for ultra-high-speed communications. In solid-state electrically-pumped lasers, the primary route for generating short pulses is through passive mode-locking. However, this has not yet been achieved in the THz range, defining one of the longest standing goals over the last two decades. In fact, the realization of passive mode-locking has long been assumed to be inherently hindered by the fast recovery times associated with the intersubband gain of THz lasers. Here, we demonstrate a self-starting miniaturized ultra-short pulse THz laser, exploiting an original device architecture that includes the surface patterning of multilayer-graphene saturable absorbers distributed along the entire cavity of a double-metal semiconductor 2.30-3.55 THz wire laser. Self-starting pulsed emission with 4.0-ps-long pulses in a compact, all-electronic, all-passive and inexpensive configuration is demonstrated.",physics,physics.optics,1
Multi-State Image Restoration by Transmission of Bit-Decomposed Data,"We report on the restoration of gray-scale image when it is decomposed into a binary form before transmission. We assume that a gray-scale image expressed by a set of Q-Ising spins is first decomposed into an expression using Ising (binary) spins by means of the threshold division, namely, we produce (Q-1) binary Ising spins from a Q-Ising spin by the function F(\sigma_i - m) = 1 if the input data \sigma_i \in {0,.....,Q-1} is \sigma_i \geq m and 0 otherwise, where m \in {1,....,Q-1} is the threshold value. The effects of noise are different from the case where the raw Q-Ising values are sent. We investigate which is more effective to use the binary data for transmission or to send the raw Q-Ising values. By using the mean-field model, we first analyze the performance of our method quantitatively. Then we obtain the static and dynamical properties of restoration using the bit-decomposed data. In order to investigate what kind of original picture is efficiently restored by our method, the standard image in two dimensions is simulated by the mean-field annealing, and we compare the performance of our method with that using the Q-Ising form. We show that our method is more efficient than the one using the Q-Ising form when the original picture has large parts in which the nearest neighboring pixels take close values.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,What makes slow samples slow in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model,"Using results of a Monte Carlo simulation of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, we try to characterize the slow disorder samples, namely we analyze visually the correlation between the relaxation time for a given disorder sample $J$ with several observables of the system for the same disorder sample. For temperatures below $T_c$ but not too low, fast samples (small relaxation times) are clearly correlated with a small value of the largest eigenvalue of the coupling matrix, a large value of the site averaged local field probability distribution at the origin, or a small value of the squared overlap $<q^2>$. Within our limited data, the correlation remains as the system size increases but becomes less clear as the temperature is decreased (the correlation with $<q^2>$ is more robust) . There is a strong correlation between the values of the relaxation time for two distinct values of the temperature, but this correlation decreases as the system size is increased. This may indicate the onset of temperature chaos.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,1
Herschel PACS and SPIRE Observations of TWA brown dwarf discs,"We present Herschel SPIRE observations for the TW Hydrae association (TWA) brown dwarf discs SSSPM J1102-3431 (SS1102) and 2MASSW J1207334-393254 (2M1207). Both discs are undetected in the SPIRE 200-500mu bands. We have also analyzed the archival PACS data and find no detection for either source in the 160mu band. Based on radiative transfer modeling, we estimate an upper limit to the disc mass for both sources of 0.1 M_Jup. The lack of detection in the SPIRE bands could be due to a paucity of millimeter sized dust grains in the 2M1207 and SS1102 discs. We also report a non-detection for the brown dwarf 2MASS J1139511-315921 (2M1139) in the PACS 70 and 160mu bands. We have argued for the presence of a warm debris disc around 2M1139, based on an excess emission observed at 24mu. The mid-infrared colors for 2M1139 are similar to the transition discs in the Taurus and Ophuichus regions. A comparison of the brown dwarf disc masses over a ~1-10 Myr age interval suggests a decline in the disc mass with the age of the system.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Stellar Polarimetry: Where Are We and Where Are We Going?,"On the final day of the Stellar Polarimetry conference, participants split up into three ""breakout sessions"" to discuss the future of the field in the areas of instrumentation, upcoming opportunities, and community priorities.

Mid-Infrared Imaging of Nearby Radio-Loud AGN,"We present high spatial resolution MIR observations for several nearby radio loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGN), which were obtained using the Gemini North and South telescopes. Of the six observed objects, we detected five in the Si-2 (8.7 microns) and Si-6 (12.3 microns) filters, of which two objects show some evidence of low level extended emission surrounding the unresolved nucleus. In Pictor A, we also obtained an image in Qs (18.3 microns) that has a flux of only half that seen in the Spitzer image, suggesting structure on arcsecond scales. We also used the Si-6 (12.3 microns) flux measurement to investigate correlation between our MIR flux and xray luminosity and compare this to results for AGN in general. This work also forms a basis for future high resolution imaging and spectroscopy of these objects.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Small scale clustering of late forming dark matter,"We perform a study of the nonlinear clustering of matter in the late-forming dark matter (LFDM) scenario in which dark matter results from the transition of a nonminimally coupled scalar field from radiation to collisionless matter. A distinct feature of this model is the presence of a damped oscillatory cutoff in the linear matter power spectrum at small scales. We use a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations to study the imprints of LFDM on the nonlinear matter power spectrum, the halo mass and velocity functions and the halo density profiles. The model largely satisfies high-redshift matter power spectrum constraints from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements, while it predicts suppressed abundance of low-mass halos ($\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_\odot$) at all redshifts compared to a vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model. The analysis of the LFDM halo velocity function shows a better agreement than the $\Lambda$CDM prediction with the observed abundance of low-velocity galaxies in the local volume. Halos with mass $M\gtrsim 10^{11}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_\odot$ show minor departures of the density profiles from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, while smaller-mass halos are less dense, consistent with the fact that they form later than their $\Lambda$CDM counterparts.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
SO(5) symmetry in the quantum Hall effect in graphene,"Electrons in graphene have four flavors associated with low-energy spin and valley degrees of freedom. The fractional quantum Hall effect in graphene is dominated by long-range Coulomb interactions which are invariant under rotations in spin-valley space. This SU(4) symmetry is spontaneously broken at most filling factors, and also weakly broken by atomic scale valley-dependent and valley-exchange interactions with coupling constants $g_{z}$ and $g_{\perp}$. In this paper we demonstrate that when $g_{z}=-g_{\perp}$ an exact SO(5) symmetry survives which unifies the N\'eel spin order parameter of the antiferromagnetic state and the $XY$ valley order parameter of the Kekul\'e distortion state into a single five-component order parameter. The proximity of the highly insulating quantum Hall state observed in graphene at $\nu=0$ to an ideal SO(5) symmetric quantum Hall state remains an open experimental question. We illustrate the physics associated with this SO(5) symmetry by studying the multiplet structure and collective dynamics of filling factor $\nu=0$ quantum Hall states based on exact-diagonalization and low-energy effective theory approaches. This allows to illustrate how manifestations of the SO(5) symmetry would survive even when it is weakly broken.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Effects of Pb doping on structural and electronics properties of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10}$,"Pb doping effect in the Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10}$ compound (Bi2223) on the structural and electronic properties were investigated, using the Local Density (LDA) and Virtual Crystal (VCA) approximations within the framework of the Density Functional Theory (DFT), taking as reference the procedure implemented by H.Lin {\it et al.} in the Bi2212 compound [{\it Phys.

Results show that, the incorporation of Pb-dopant in Bi2223 lead a rigid displacement of the Bi/Pb-O bands toward higher energies, with a null contribution at the Fermi level, around the high symmetry point $\overline{\text{M}}$ in the irreducible Brillouin zone, for Pb doping concentration equal to or more than 26\%, avoiding the presence of the so-called Bi-O {\it pockets} in the Fermi surface, in good agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, although a slight metallic character of the Bi-O bonds is still observed which would disagree with some experimental reports.

Inelastic neutrino scattering off hot nuclei in supernova environments,"We study inelastic neutrino scattering off hot nuclei for temperatures relevant under supernova conditions. The method we use is based on the quasiparticle random phase approximation extended to finite temperatures within the thermo field dynamics (TQRPA). The method allows a transparent treatment of upward and downward transitions in hot nuclei, avoiding the application of Brink's hypothesis. For the sample nuclei $^{56}$Fe and $^{82}$Ge we perform a detailed analysis of thermal effects on the strength distributions of allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions which dominate the scattering process at low neutrino energies. For $^{56}$Fe and $^{82}$Ge the finite temperature cross-sections are calculated by taking into account the contribution of allowed and forbidden transitions. The observed enhancement of the cross-section at low neutrino energies is explained by considering thermal effects on the GT strength. For $^{56}$Fe we compare the calculated cross-sections to those obtained earlier from a hybrid approach that combines large-scale shell-model and RPA calculations.",nucl,nucl-th,Pion masses in quasiconformal gauge field theories,"We study modifications to Weinberg-like sum rules in quasiconformal gauge field theories.

The results are found to be strongly dependent on either the broadened line is separated or it is overlapped with other lines of the spectrum. Three models of disorder, i.e. weak point-like impurities, weak smooth random potential and strong rare impurities are investigated in details. The possibility to form the phonon-impurity bound state is also studied.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,A note contrasting two microscopic theories of the fractional quantum Hall effect,"Two microscopic theories have been proposed for the explanation of the fractional quantum Hall effect, namely the Haldane-Halperin hierarchy theory and the composite fermion theory. Contradictory statements have been made regarding the relation between them, ranging from their being distinct to their being completely equivalent. This article attempts to provide a clarification of the issue. It is shown that the two theories postulate distinct microscopic mechanisms for the origin of the fractional quantum Hall effect, and make substantially different predictions that have allowed experiments to distinguish between them.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Observed spectral energy distribution of the thermal emission from the dayside of WASP-46b,"We aim to construct a spectral energy distribution (SED) for the emission from the dayside atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-46b and to investigate its energy budget. We observed a secondary eclipse of WASP-46b simultaneously in the g'r'i'z'JHK bands using the GROND instrument on the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. Eclipse depths of the acquired light curves were derived to infer the brightness temperatures at multibands that cover the SED peak. We report the first detection of the thermal emission from the dayside of WASP-46b in the K band at 4.2-sigma level and tentative detections in the H (2.5-sigma) and J (2.3-sigma) bands, with flux ratios of 0.253 +0.063/-0.060%, 0.194 +/- 0.078%, and 0.129 +/- 0.055%, respectively. The derived brightness temperatures (2306 +177/-187K, 2462 +245/-302K, and 2453 +198/-258K, respectively) are consistent with an isothermal temperature profile of 2386K, which is significantly higher than the dayside-averaged equilibrium temperature, indicative of very poor heat redistribution efficiency. We also investigate the tentative detections in the g'r'i' bands and the 3-sigma upper limit in the z' band, which might indicate the existence of reflective clouds if these tentative detections do not arise from systematics.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Precise determination of fundamental parameters of six exoplanet host stars and their planets,"The aim of this paper is to determinate the fundamental parameters of six exoplanet host (EH) stars and their planets. While techniques for detecting exoplanets yield properties of the planet only as a function of the properties of the host star, hence, we must accurately determine parameters of EH stars at first. For this reason, we constructed a grid of stellar models including diffusion and rotation-induced extra-mixing with given ranges of input parameters (i.e. mass, metallicity, and initial rotation rate). In addition to the commonly used observational constraints such as the effective temperature T_{eff}, luminosity L and metallicity [Fe/H], we added two observational constraints, the lithium abundance log N (Li) and the rotational period P_{rot}. These two additional observed parameters can make further constrains on the model due to their correlations with mass, age and other stellar properties. Hence, our estimations of fundamental parameters for these EH stars and their planets are with higher precision than previous works. Therefore, the combination of rotational period and lithium help us to obtain more accurate parameters for stars, leading to an improvement of the knowledge of the physical state about the EH stars and their planets.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Harmonically Trapped Atoms with Spin-Orbit Coupling,"We study harmonically trapped one-dimensional atoms subjected to an equal combination of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling induced by Raman transition. We first examine the wave function and the degeneracy of the single-particle ground state, followed by a study of two weakly interacting bosons or fermions. For the two-particle ground state, we focus on the effects of the interaction on the degeneracy, the spin density profiles, and the density-density correlation functions. Finally we show how these studies help us to understand the many-body properties of the system.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Finite-temperature effects on a triatomic Efimov resonance in ultracold cesium,We report a thorough investigation of finite-temperature effects on three-body recombination near a triatomic Efimov resonance in an ultracold gas of cesium atoms. Our measurements cover a wide range from a near-ideal realization of the zero-temperature limit to a strongly temperature-dominated regime. The experimental results are analyzed within a recently introduced theoretical model based on a universal zero-range theory. The temperature-induced shift of the resonance reveals a contribution that points to an energy-dependence of the three-body parameter. We interpret this contribution in terms of the finite range of the van der Waals interaction in real atomic systems and we quantify it in an empirical way based on length scale arguments. A universal character of the corresponding resonance shift is suggested by observations related to other Efimov resonances and the comparison with a theoretical finite-temperature approach that explicitly takes the van der Waals interaction into account. Our findings are of importance for the precise determination of Efimov resonance positions from experiments at finite temperatures.,cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,1
Thermoelectric Signal Enhancement by Reconciling the Spin Seebeck and Anomalous Nernst Effects in Ferromagnet/Non-magnet Multilayers,"The utilization of ferromagnetic (FM) materials in thermoelectric devices allows one to have a simpler structure and/or independent control of electric and thermal conductivities, which may further remove obstacles for this technology to be realized. The thermoelectricity in FM/non-magnet (NM) heterostructures using an optical heating source is studied as a function of NM materials and a number of multilayers. It is observed that the overall thermoelectric signal in those structures which is contributed by spin Seebeck effect and anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) is enhanced by a proper selection of NM materials with a spin Hall angle that matches to the sign of the ANE. Moreover, by an increase of the number of multilayer, the thermoelectric voltage is enlarged further and the device resistance is reduced, simultaneously. The experimental observation of the improvement of thermoelectric properties may pave the way for the realization of magnetic-(or spin-) based thermoelectric devices.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,A laser-ARPES study of LaNiO3 thin films grown by sputter deposition,"Thin films of the correlated transition-metal oxide LaNiO$_3$ undergo a metal-insulator transition when their thickness is reduced to a few unit cells. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to study the evolution of the electronic structure across this transition in a series of epitaxial LaNiO$_3$ films of thicknesses ranging from 19 to 2 u.c. grown in situ by RF magnetron sputtering. Our data show a strong reduction of the electronic mean free path as the thickness is reduced below 5 u.c. This prevents the system from becoming electronically two-dimensional, as confirmed by the largely unchanged Fermi surface seen in our experiments. In the insulating state we observe a strong suppression of the coherent quasiparticle peak but no clear gap. These features resemble previous observations of the insulating state of NdNiO$_3$.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Computational Analysis of Factors Influencing Enhancement of Thermal Conductivity of Nanofluids,"Numerical investigations are conducted to study the effect of factors such as particle clustering and interfacial layer thickness on thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Based on this, parameters including Kapitza radius, and fractal and chemical dimension which have received little attention by previous research are rigorously investigated. The degree of thermal enhancement is analysed for increasing aggregate size, particle concentration, interfacial thermal resistance, and fractal and chemical dimensions. This analysis is conducted for water-based nanofluids of Alumina (Al2O3), CuO and Titania (TiO2) nanoparticles where the particle concentrations are varied up to 4vol%. Results from the numerical work are validated using available experimental data. For the case of aggregate size, particle concentration and interfacial thermal resistance; the aspect ratio (ratio of radius of gyration of aggregate to radius of primary particle, Rg/a) is varied between 2 to 60. It was found that the enhancement decreases with interfacial layer thickness. Also the rate of decrease is more significant after a given aggregate size. For a given interfacial resistance, the enhancement is mostly sensitive to Rg/a <20 indicated by the steep gradients of data plots. Predicted and experimental data for thermal conductivity enhancement are in good agreement.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Anisotropic colloids through non-trivial buckling,"We present a study on buckling of colloidal particles, including experimental, theoretical and numerical developments. Oil-filled thin shells prepared by emulsion templating show buckling in mixtures of water and ethanol, due to dissolution of the core in the external medium. This leads to conformations with a single depression, either axisymmetric or polygonal depending on the geometrical features of the shells. These conformations could be theoretically and/or numerically reproduced in a model of homogeneous spherical thin shells with bending and stretching elasticity, submitted to an isotropic external pressure.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Positivity Bounds and the Massless Spin-2 Pole,"The presence of a massless spin-2 field in an effective field theory results in a $t$-channel pole in the scattering amplitudes that precludes the application of standard positivity bounds. Despite this, recent arguments based on compactification to three dimensions have suggested that positivity bounds may be applied to the $t$-channel pole subtracted amplitude. If correct this would have deep implications for UV physics and the Weak Gravity Conjecture. Within the context of a simple renormalizable field theory coupled to gravity we find that applying these arguments would constrain the low-energy coupling constants in a way which is incompatible with their actual values. This contradiction persists on deforming the theory. Further enforcing the $t$-channel pole subtracted positivity bounds on such generic renormalizable effective theories coupled to gravity would imply new physics at a scale parametrically smaller than expected, with far reaching implications. This suggests that generically the standard positivity bounds are inapplicable with gravity and we highlight a number of issues that impinge on the formulation of a three-dimensional amplitude which simultaneously satisfies the required properties of analyticity, positivity and crossing symmetry. We conjecture instead a modified bound that ought to be satisfied independently of the precise details of the high energy completion.",hep,hep-th,Doubly Special Relativity versus $\kappa$-deformation of relativistic kinematics,"We argue that recently proposed by Amelino-Camelia et all [1,2] so-called doubly special relativity (DSR), with deformed boost transformations identical with the formulae for $\kappa$-deformed kinematics in bicrossproduct basis is a classical special relativity in nonlinear disguise. The choice of symmetric composition law for deformed fourmomenta as advocated in [1, 2] implies that DSR is obtained by considering nonlinear fourmomenta basis of classical Poincar\'{e} algebra and it does not lead to noncommutative space-time. We also show how to construct large two classes of doubly special relativity theories - generalizing the choice in [1,2] and the one presented by Magueijo and Smolin [3]. The older version of deformed relativistic kinematics, differing essentially from classical theory in the coalgebra sector and leading to noncommutative $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space is provided by quantum $\kappa$-deformation of Poincar\'e symmetries.",hep,hep-th,1
Band structure asymmetry of bilayer graphene revealed by infrared spectroscopy,"We report on infrared spectroscopy of bilayer graphene integrated in gated structures. We observed a significant asymmetry in the optical conductivity upon electrostatic doping of electrons and holes. We show that this finding arises from a marked asymmetry between the valence and conduction bands, which is mainly due to the inequivalence of the two sublattices within the graphene layer. From the conductivity data, the energy difference of the two sublattices is determined.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Tuning of heat and charge transport by Majorana fermions,"We investigate theoretically thermal and electrical conductances for the system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) connected both to a pair of Majorana fermions residing the edges of a Kitaev wire and two metallic leads. We demonstrate that both quantities reveal pronounced resonances, whose positions can be controlled by tuning of an asymmetry of the couplings of the QD and a pair of MFs. Similar behavior is revealed for the thermopower, Wiedemann-Franz law and dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit. The considered geometry can thus be used as a tuner of heat and charge transport assisted by MFs.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Dynamical suppression of non-adiabatic modes,"Recent analyses of the WMAP 5-year data constrain possible non-adiabatic contributions to the initial conditions of CMB anisotropies. Depending upon the early dynamics of the plasma, the amplitude of the entropic modes can experience a different suppression by the time of photon decoupling. Explicit examples of the latter observation are presented both analytically and numerically when the post-inflationary dynamics is dominated by a stiff contribution.",hep,hep-th,Landau meets Newton: time translation symmetry breaking in classical mechanics,"Every classical Newtonian mechanical system can be equipped with a nonstandard Hamiltonian structure, in which the Hamiltonian is the square of the canonical Hamiltonian up to a constant shift, and the Poisson bracket is nonlinear. In such a formalism, time translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, provided the potential function becomes negative. A nice analogy between time translation symmetry breaking and the Landau theory of second order phase transitions is established, together with several example cases illustrating time translation breaking ground states. In particular, the $\Lambda$CDM model of FRW cosmology is reformulated as the time translation symmetry breaking ground states.",hep,hep-th,1
Charm mass effects in bulk channel correlations,"The bulk viscosity of thermalized QCD matter at temperatures above a few hundred MeV could be significantly influenced by charm quarks because their contribution arises four perturbative orders before purely gluonic effects. In an attempt to clarify the challenges of a lattice study, we determine the relevant imaginary-time correlator (of massive scalar densities) up to NLO in perturbation theory, and compare with existing data. We find discrepancies much larger than in the vector channel; this may hint, apart from the importance of taking a continuum limit, to larger non-perturbative effects in the scalar channel. We also recall how a transport peak related to the scalar density spectral function encodes non-perturbative information concerning the charm quark chemical equilibration rate close to equilibrium.",hep,hep-lat,The nature of the Roberge-Weiss Transition in $N_f=2$ QCD with Wilson Fermions on $N_\tau=6$ lattices,"The finite temperature chiral and deconfinement phase transitions at zero density for light and heavy quarks, respectively, have analytic continuations to imaginary chemical potential. At some critical imaginary chemical potential, they meet the Roberge-Weiss transition between adjacent $Z(3)$ sectors. For light and heavy quarks, where the chiral and deconfinement transitions are first order, the transition lines meet in a triple point. For intermediate masses chiral or deconfinement transitions are crossover and the Roberge-Weiss transition ends in a second order point. At the boundary between these regimes the junction is a tricritical point, as shown in studies with $N_f=2,3$ flavors of staggered and Wilson quarks on $N_\tau=4$ lattices. Employing finite size scaling we investigate the nature of this point as a function of quark mass for $N_f=2$ flavors of Wilson fermions with a temporal lattice extent of $N_\tau=6$. In particular we are interested in the change of the location of tricritical points compared to our ealier study on $N_\tau=4$.",hep,hep-lat,1
Molecular beam epitaxy and defect structure of Ge (111)/epi-Gd2O3 (111) /Si (111) heterostructures,"Molecular beam epitaxy of Ge (111) thin films on epitaxial-Gd2O3/Si(111) substrates is reported, along with a systematic investigation of the evolution of Ge growth, and structural defects in the grown epilayer. While Ge growth begins in the Volmer-Weber growth mode, the resultant islands coalesce within the first 10 nm of growth, beyond which a smooth two-dimensional surface evolves. Coalescence of the initially formed islands results in formation of rotation and reflection microtwins, which constitute a volume fraction of less than 1 %. It is also observed that while the stacking sequence of the (111) planes in the Ge epilayer is similar to that of the Si substrate, the (111) planes of the Gd2O3 epilayer are rotated by 180 degree about the [111] direction. In metal-semiconductor-metal schottky photodiodes fabricated with these all-epitaxial Ge-on-insulator (GeOI) samples, significant suppression of dark current is observed due to the presence of the Gd2O3 epilayer. These results are promising for application of these GeOI structures as virtual substrates, or for realization of high-speed group-IV photonic components.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"Low-frequency Noise in Individual Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors with Top, Side and Back Gate Configurations: Effect of Gamma Irradiation","We report on the influence of low gamma irradiation (10^4 Gy) on the noise properties of individual carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistors (FETs) with different gate configurations and two different dielectric layers, SiO2 and Al2O3. Before treatment, strong generation-recombination (GR) noise components are observed. These data are used to identify several charge traps related to dielectric layers of the FETs by determining their activation energy. Investigation of samples with a single SiO2 dielectric layer as well as with two dielectric layers allows us to separate traps for each of the two dielectric layers. We reveal that each charge trap level observed in the side gate operation splits into two levels in top gate operation due to a different potential profile along the CNT channel. After gamma irradiation, only reduced flicker noise is registered in the noise spectra, which indicates a decrease of the number of charge traps. The mobility, which is estimated to be larger than 2x10^4 cm2V-1s-1 at room temperature, decreases only slightly after radiation treatment demonstrating high radiation hardness of the CNTs. Finally, we study the influence of Schottky barriers at the metal-nanotube interface on the transport properties of FETs analyzing the behavior of the flicker noise component.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Hadronic linear potentials in AdS/CFT,"In 1998, J. M. Maldacena conjectured a precise duality in the low-energy (or decoupling) regime between a large N strongly-coupled SU(N) super-Yang-Mills theory defined in the four-dimensional Minkowski world-volume M^4 of a stack of N coincident D3-branes and the supergravity limit of a weakly-coupled type IIB closed superstring theory on AdS_5*S^5. This communication aims at introducing concepts and methods used to derive, in the gauge/string correspondence framework, the interaction potentials of mesons and baryons at zero and finite temperature. Especially, emphasize will be made on the linear behavior of the bound-state potentials derived in the gravity side. Although AdS/CFT cannot be applied ab initio to QCD-like gauge theories and remains a controversial topic, at least at zero temperature, we will also discuss AdS/QCD criteria proposed for a holographic description of the mechanism of confinement.",hep,hep-th,"Reply to ""Comment on `Energy Conditions in $f(Q)$ gravity'""","Recently, Avik De and L.T. How claim that we have not followed an effective theory approach for $f(Q)$ gravity, missing relevant terms to compute the energy conditions [Phys. Rev. D 102, 024057 (2020)]. They also state that we did not present how the pressure and energy density follow a set of energy condition criteria. In this reply we show how the effective density and effective pressure found in the comment yield to the same Fridmann Equations presented in our article. Therefore, we claim that the comment only introduces an equivalent path to derive the Friedmann Equations and that the extra terms found by Avik De and L.T. How are consequence of their specific definition for their effective density and effective pressure. However, such terms do not change the equations for $\rho$ and $p$. Consequently, these extra terms are not going to change the energy constraints presented by us in Phys. Rev. D 102, 024057 (2020).",hep,hep-th,1
Small Fermi energy and phonon anharmonicity in MgB_2 and related compounds,"The remarkable anharmonicity of the E_{2g} phonon in MgB_2 has been suggested in literature to play a primary role in its superconducting pairing. We investigate, by means of LDA calculations, the microscopic origin of such an anharmonicity in MgB_2, AlB_2, and in hole-doped graphite. We find that the anharmonic character of the E_{2g} phonon is essentially driven by the small Fermi energy of the sigma holes. We present a simple analytic model which allows us to understand in microscopic terms the role of the small Fermi energy and of the electronic structure. The relation between anharmonicity and nonadiabaticity is pointed out and discussed in relation to various materials.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"Formation Energy, Stress, and Relaxations of Low-Index Rhodium Surfaces","Ab initio local-density-functional-theory calculations of formation energies, surface stress, and multilayer relaxations are reported for the (111), (100), and (110) surfaces of Rh.

Softening of Roton and Phonon Modes in a Bose-Einstein Condensate with Spin-Orbit Coupling,"Roton-type excitations usually emerge from strong correlations or long-range interactions, as in superfluid helium or dipolar ultracold atoms. However, in weakly short-range interacting quantum gas, the recently synthesized spin-orbit (SO) coupling can lead to various unconventional phases of superfluidity, and give rise to an excitation spectrum of roton-maxon character. Using Bragg spectroscopy we study a SO coupled Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms, and show that the excitation spectrum in a ""magnetized"" phase clearly possesses a two-branch and roton-maxon structure. As Raman coupling strength $\Omega$ is decreased, a roton-mode softening is observed, as a precursor of the phase transition to a stripe phase that spontaneously breaks spatially translational symmetry. The measured roton gaps agree well with theoretical calculations. Further, we determine sound velocities both in the magnetized and the non-magnetized phase, and a phonon-mode softening is observed around the phase transition in between. The validity of the $f$-sum rule is examined.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,The Fine Structure of the Phonon in One Dimension from Quantum Hydrodynamics,"We show that the resonant interactions between phonons in one dimension may be treated consistently within Quantum Hydrodynamics by the introduction of phonon dispersion. In this way the physics of a nonlinear Luttinger liquid may be described in terms of hydrodynamic (i.e. bosonized) variables without recourse to refermionization or the introduction of fictitious impurities. We focus on the calculation of the dynamic structure factor for a model with quadratic dispersion, which has the Benjamin--Ono equation of fluid dynamics as its equation of motion. We find singular behavior in the vicinity of upper and lower energetic thresholds corresponding to phonon and soliton branches of the classical theory, which may be benchmarked against known results for the Calogero--Sutherland model.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,1
F-theoretic vs microscopic description of a conformal N=2 SYM theory,"The F-theory background of four D7 branes in a type I' orientifold was conjectured to be described by the Seiberg-Witten curve for the superconformal SU(2) gauge theory with four flavors. This relation was explained by considering in this background a probe D3 brane, which supports this theory with SU(2) realized as Sp(1). Here we explicitly compute the non-perturbative corrections to the D7/D3 system in type I' due to D-instantons. This computation provides both the quartic effective action on the D7 branes and the quadratic effective action on the D3 brane; the latter agrees with the F-theoretic prediction. The action obtained in this way is related to the one derived from the usual instanton calculus \`a la Nekrasov (or from its AGT realization in terms of Liouville conformal blocks) by means of a non-perturbative redefinition of the coupling constant. We also point out an intriguing relation between the four-dimensional theory on the probe D3 brane, which has a SO(8) flavor symmetry, and the eight-dimensional dynamics on the D7 branes. On the latter, SO(8) represents a gauge group and the flavor masses correspond to the vacuum expectation values of an adjoint scalar field m: what we find is that the exact effective coupling in four dimensions is obtained from its perturbative part by taking into account in its mass dependence the full quantum dynamics of the field m in eight dimensions.",hep,hep-th,Understanding Our Universe: Current Status and Open Issues,"Last couple of decades have been the golden age for cosmology.

Computing bulk and shear viscosities from simulations of fluids with dissipative and stochastic interactions,"Exact values for bulk and shear viscosity are important to characterize a fluid and they are a necessary input for a continuum description. Here we present two novel methods to compute bulk viscosities by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of steady-state systems with periodic boundary conditions -- one based on frequent particle displacements and one based on the application of external bulk forces with an inhomogeneous force profile. In equilibrium simulations, viscosities can be determined from the stress tensor fluctuations via Green-Kubo relations; however, the correct incorporation of random and dissipative forces is not obvious. We discuss different expressions proposed in the literature and test them at the example of a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) fluid.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Structural Origin of the Two-Step Glass Transition,"The glass transition is a long-standing problem in physics. Identifying the structural origin of the transition may lead to the ultimate solution to the problem. Here, for the first time, we discover such a structural origin by proposing a novel method to analyze structure-dynamics relation in glasses. An interesting two-step glass transition, with rotational glass transition preceding translational one, is identified experimentally in 2D colloidal rod systems. During the transition, parallel and perpendicularly packed rods are found to form local free energy minima in configurational space, separated by an activation barrier. This barrier increases significantly when rotational glass transition is approached; thereby the rotational motion is frozen while the translational one remains diffusive. We argue that the activation barrier for rotation is the origin of the two-step glass transition. Such an activation barrier between well-defined local configurations holds the key to understand the two-step glass transition in general.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1

Recent insights on the penumbra formation process,"Using high-resolution spectropolarimetric data acquired by \textit{IBIS}, as well as \textit{SDO}/HMI observations, we studied the penumbra formation in AR NOAA 11490 and in a sample of twelve ARs appeared on the solar disk on 2011 and 2012, which were characterized by $\beta$-type magnetic field configuration. The results show that the onset of the classical Evershed flow occurs in a very short time scale, 1-3 hours. Studying the formation of the first penumbral sector around the following proto-spot, we found that a stable penumbra forms in the area facing the opposite polarity, which appears to be co-spatial with an AFS, i.e. in a flux emergence region, in contrast with the results of \cite{Schlichenmaier2010} concerning the leading polarity of AR NOAA 11490. Conversely, analyzing the sample of twelve ARs, we noticed that there is not a preferred location for the formation of the first penumbral sector. We also observed before the penumbra formation an inverse Evershed flow, which changes its sign when the penumbra appears. This confirms the observational evidence that the appearance of the penumbral filaments is correlated with the transition from the inverse Evershed to the classical Evershed flow. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that the time needed to form the penumbra may be related to the location where the penumbra first appears. New high-resolution observations, like those that will be provided by the European Solar Telescope, are expected to increase our understanding of the penumbra formation process.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Dynamical Evolution of White Dwarfs in Triples in the Era of Gaia,"The $Gaia$ mission has detected many white dwarfs (WDs) in binary and triple configurations, and while observations suggest that triple stellar systems are common in our Galaxy, not much attention was devoted to WDs in triples. For stability reasons, these triples must have hierarchical configurations, i.e., two stars are on a tight orbit (the inner binary), with the third companion on a wider orbit about the inner binary. In such a system, the two orbits torque each other via the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism (EKL), which can alter the orbital configuration of the inner binary. We simulate thousands of triple stellar systems for over $10$ Gyr, tracking gravitational interactions, tides, general relativity, and stellar evolution up to their WD fate. As demonstrated here, three-body dynamics coupled with stellar evolution is a critical channel to form tight WD binaries or merge a WD binary. Amongst these triples, we explore their manifestations as cataclysmic variables, Type Ia supernovae, and gravitational-wave events. The simulated systems are then compared to a sample of WD triples selected from the $Gaia$ catalog. We find that including the effect of mass loss-induced kicks is crucial for producing a distribution of the inner binary-tertiary separations that is consistent with $Gaia$ observations. Lastly, we leverage this consistency to estimate that, at minimum, $30\%$ of solar-type stars in the local $200$ parsecs were born in triples.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1

Those force-free fields obtainable from the uniform field by continuous magnetic footpoint displacements at the plates have field topologies that are shown to be a restricted subset of the field topologies similarly created without imposing the force-free equilibirum condition. The theorem then follows from the deduction that a continuous nonequilibrum field with a topology not in that subset must find a force-free state containing tangential discontinuities.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
DM+$b\bar b$ simulations with DMSimp: an update,"Searches for dark matter (DM) produced using collider data probe wide regions of the allowed parameter space of many models and have become competitive with more traditional searches. The interpretations of the results can be efficiently performed in simplified models, which feature only a mediator and a DM candidate together with the interactions among them and the standard model particles. The DMSimp model in FeynRules currently features a wide set of $s$-channel simplified models and can be exploited by the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework to produce event samples including NLO QCD corrections for realistic simulations. Higher-order corrections typically have a sizeable impact on the total production rate and lead to a reduction of the theoretical uncertainties. In this short note we report on a recent update of the DMSimp model, which makes it possible to simulate dark matter production in association with bottom quarks in a mixed four-flavour scheme, where the $\overline{\rm MS}$ renormalisation for the bottom-quark Yukawa is employed, while the bottom quark mass is on shell. By comparing with five-flavour scheme, we show that the mixed four-flavor scheme provides reliable predictions for DM+$b\bar b$ final states in a wide range of DM masses.",hep,hep-ph,New QCD Sum Rule for $D(0^+)$,"We derive a new QCD sum rule for $D(0^+)$ which has only the $D\pi$ continuum with a resonance in the hadron side, using the assumption similar to that has been successfully used in our previous work to the mass of $D_s(0^+)(2317)$. For the value of the pole mass $M_c=1.38 $ GeV as used in the $D_s(0^+)$ case we find that the mass of $D(0^+)$ derived from this sum rule is significantly lower than that derived from the sum rule with the pole approximation. Our result is in agreement with the experimental dada from Belle.",hep,hep-ph,1
An extremal model for amorphous media plasticity,"An extremal model for the plasticity of amorphous materials is studied in a simple two-dimensional anti-plane geometry. The steady-state is analyzed through numerical simulations. Long-range spatial and temporal correlations in local slip events are shown to develop, leading to non-trivial and highly anisotropic scaling laws. In particular, the plastic strain is shown to statistically concentrate over a region which tends to align perpendicular to the displacement gradient. By construction, the model can be seen as giving rise to a depinning transition, the threshold of which (i.e. the macroscopic yield stress) also reveal scaling properties reflecting the localization of the activity.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Optical conductivity of metals from first principles,"A computational method to obtain optical conductivities from first principles is presented. It exploits a relation between the conductivity and the complex dielectric function, which is constructed from the full electronic band structure within the random-phase approximation. In contrast to the Drude model, no empirical parameters are used. As interband transitions as well as local-field effects are properly included, the calculated spectra are valid over a wide frequency range. As an illustration I present quantitative results for selected simple metals, noble metals, and ferromagnetic transition metals. The implementation is based on the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave method.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Nonlinear Higher-Order Thermo-Hydrodynamics: Generalized Approach in a Nonequilibrium Ensemble Formalism,"Construction of a nonlinear higher-order thermo-hydrodynamics, including correlations, in the framework of a Generalized Nonequilibrium Statistical Grand-Canonical Ensemble is presented. In that way it is provided a particular formalism for the coupling and simultaneous treatment of the kinetics and hydrodynamic levels of description. It is based on a complete thermostatistical approach in terms of the densities of energy and of matter and their fluxes of all orders, as well as on their direct and cross correlations, covering systems arbitrarily driven-away-from equilibrium. The set of coupled nonlinear integro-differential hydrodynamic equations is derived. Illustrations of the application of the theory are described in the follow up article.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Universal properties of hard-core bosons confined on one-dimensional lattices,"Based on an exact treatment of hard-core bosons confined on one-dimensional lattices, we obtain the large distance behavior of the one-particle density matrix, and show how it determines the occupation of the lowest natural orbital in the thermodynamic limit. We also study the occupation $\lambda_{\eta}$ of the natural orbitals for large-$\eta$ at low densities. Both quantities show universal behavior independently of the confining potential. Finite-size corrections and the momentum distribution function for finite systems are also analyzed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
Study of Quasi-two-body $B_{(s)}\to \phi (f_0(980)/f_2(1270)\to)\pi\pi$ Decays in Perturbative QCD Approach,"In 2017, LHCb collaboration reported their first observation of the rare decays $B_s \to \phi (f_0(980)$ $/f_2(1270) \to ) \pi^+\pi^-$ and the evidence of $B^0 \to \phi(f_0(980)/f_2(1270)\to)\pi^+\pi^-$. Motivated by this, we study these quasi-two-body decays in the perturbative QCD approach. The branching fractions, $CP$ asymmetries and the polarization fractions are calculated. We find that within the appropriate two-meson wave functions, the calculated branching fractions are in agreement with the measurements of LHCb. Based on the narrow-width approximation, We also calculate the branching fractions of the quasi-two-body $B_{d,s}\to \phi(f_0(980)/f_2(1270)\to) \pi^0\pi^0$ and $B_{d,s}\to \phi(f_2(1270)\to) K^+K^-$, and hope the predictions to be tested in the ongoing LHCb and Belle II experiments. Moreover, the processes $B_{d,s}\to \phi f_2(1270)$ are also analyzed under this approximation. We note that the $CP$ asymmetries of these decays are very small, because these decays are either penguin dominant or pure penguin processes.",hep,hep-ex,Testing new physics models by top charge asymmetry and polarization at the LHC,"As a top quark factory, the LHC can test the new physics models used to explain the top quark forward-backward asymmetry A^t_FB measured at the Tevatron. In this work we perform a comparative study for two such models: the W'-model and the color triplet diquark (\phi) model. Requiring these models to explain A^t_FB and also satisfy the top pair production rate measured at the Tevatron, we examine their contributions to the LHC observables such as the polarization and charge asymmetry in top quark and W' (or \phi) productions. We find that these observables can be enhanced to the observable level and the current LHC measurement on the top charge asymmetry can already tightly constrain the W'-model. We also find that each observable shows different characteristics in different models, which can be utilized to discriminate the models.",hep,hep-ex,1
Superconductivity and single crystal growth of Ni0:05TaS2,"Superconductivity was discovered in a Ni0:05TaS2 single crystal. A Ni0:05TaS2 single crystal was successfully grown via the NaCl/KCl flux method. The obtained lattice constant c of Ni0:05TaS2 is 1.1999 nm, which is significantly smaller than that of 2H-TaS2 (1.208 nm). Electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements reveal that the superconductivity transition temperature of Ni0:05TaS2 is enhanced from 0.8 K (2H-TaS2) to 3.9 K. The charge-density-wave transition of the matrix compound 2H-TaS2 is suppressed in Ni0:05TaS2. The success of Ni0:05TaS2 single crystal growth via a NaCl/KCl flux demonstrates that NaCl/KCl flux method will be a feasible method for single crystal growth of the layered transition metal dichalcogenides.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,Crystal Structure of the Sodium Cobaltate Deuterate Superconductor NaxCoO2o4xD2O (x=1/3),"Neutron and x-ray powder diffraction have been used to investigate the crystal structures of a sample of the newly-discovered superconducting sodium cobaltate deuterate compound with composition Na0.31(3)CoO2o1.25(2)D2O and its anhydrous parent compound Na0.61(1)CoO2. The deuterate superconducting compound is formed by coordinating four D2O molecules (two above and two below) to each Na ion in a way that gives Na-O distances nearly equal to those in the parent compound. One deuteron of the D2O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO2 plane and the oxygen atom and the second deuteron of each D2O molecule lie approximately in a plane between the Na layer and the CoO2 layers. This coordination of Na by four D2O molecules leads to ordering of the Na ions and D2O molecules. The sample studied here, which has Tc=4.5 K, has a refined composition of Na0.31(3)CoO2o1.25(2)D2O, in agreement with the expected 1:4 ratio of Na to D2O. These results show that the optimal superconducting composition should be viewed as a specific hydrated compound, not a solid solution of Na and D2O (H2O) in NaxCoO2oyD2O. Studies of physical properties vs. Na or D2O composition should be viewed with caution until it is verified that the compound remains in the same phase over the composition range of the study.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,1
Redistribution of electronic charges in spin-Peierls state in (TMTTF)2AsF6 observed by 13C NMR,"We report ^{13}C NMR spectra and nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate 1/T_1 for a quasi-one-dimensional quarter-filled organic material (TMTTF)_{2}AsF_{6}, which undergoes charge ordering (T_{{CO}} = 102 K) and spin-Peierls phase transitions (T_{{SP}} = 14 K). The ratio of two 1/T_1 for the charge accepting and donating TMTTF sites which grows from T_{CO} finally saturates in approaching T_{{SP}}, indicating one spin correlation function even in the charge ordered state. Below T_{{SP}}, however, the doubly split NMR lines from inequivalently charged molecules merge into one line, originated from the variation in charge densities. This shows that a rearrangement of the charge configuration occurs at T_{{SP}}.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Visualizing pair formation on the atomic scale in the high-Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d,"Pairing of electrons in conventional superconductors occurs at the superconducting transition temperature Tc, creating an energy gap D in the electronic density of states (DOS). In the high-Tc superconductors, a partial gap in the DOS exists for a range of temperatures above Tc. A key question is whether the gap in the DOS above Tc is associated with pairing, and what determines the temperature at which incoherent pairs form. Here we report the first spatially resolved measurements of gap formation in a high-Tc superconductor, measured on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d samples with different Tc values (hole concentration of 0.12 to 0.22) using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Over a wide range of doping from 0.16 to 0.22 we find that pairing gaps nucleate in nanoscale regions above Tc. These regions proliferate as the temperature is lowered, resulting in a spatial distribution of gap sizes in the superconducting state. Despite the inhomogeneity, we find that every pairing gap develops locally at a temperature Tp, following the relation 2D/kBTp = 8. At very low doping (<0.14), systematic changes in the DOS indicate the presence of another phenomenon, which is unrelated and perhaps competes with electron pairing. Our observation of nanometre-sized pairing regions provides the missing microscopic basis for understanding recent reports of fluctuating superconducting response above Tc in hole-doped high-Tc copper oxide superconductors.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Gas Bubbles Emerging from a Submerged Granular Bed,"This fluid dynamics video was submitted to the Gallery of Fluid Motion for the 2009 APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In this video we show some results from a simple experiment where air was injected by a single nozzle at known constant flow rates in the bottom of a granular bed submerged in water. The injected air propagates through the granular bed in one of two modes. Mode 1 emergence involves small discrete bubbles taking tortuous paths through the interstitial space of the bed. Multiple small bubbles can be emitted from the bed in an array of locations at the same time during Mode 1 emergence. Mode 2 emergence involves large discrete bubbles locally fluidizing the granular bed and exiting the bed approximately above the injection site. Bead diameter, bead density, and air flow rate were varied to investigate the change in bubble release behavior at the top of the granular bed. This system is a useful model for methane seeps in lakes. Methane bubbles are released from the decomposition of organic matter in the lake bed. The initial size of the bubble determines how much of the gas is absorbed into the lake and how much of the gas reaches the surface and is released into the atmosphere. The size and behavior of the emerging bubbles may also affect the amount of vertical mixing occurring in the lake, as well as the mixing from the lake bed into the benthic layer.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,Dynamical Origins for Non-Gaussian Vorticity Distributions in Turbulent Flows,We present results on the connection between the vorticity equation and the shape of the single-point vorticity PDF.

"Neutrino magnetic moment, millicharge and charge radius",A brief overview of neutrino electromagnetic properties is presented from a theoretical perspective. Their potential effects on coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering are outlined.,hep,hep-ph,Charm fragmentation and associated $J/\psi + Z/W^\pm$ production at the LHC,"We consider the production of electroweak $Z$ or $W^\pm$ bosons associated with $J/\psi$ mesons at the LHC conditions. Our attention is focused on new partonic subprocesses which yet have never been considered in the literature, namely, the charmed or strange quark excitation subprocesses followed by the charmed quark fragmentation $c\to J/\psi+c$. Additionally we take into account the effects of multiple quark and gluon radiation in the initial and final states. We find that the contributions from the new mechanisms are important and significantly reduce the gap between the theoretical and experimental results on the $J/\psi + Z$ and $J/\psi + W^\pm$ production cross sections.",hep,hep-ph,1
Using two point correlation functions to understand the assembly histories of Milky Way-like galaxies,"The two point correlation function (2PCF) is a powerful statistical tool to measure galaxy clustering. Although 2PCF has also been used to study the clustering of stars on parsec and sub-parsec scales, its physical implication is not clear on such non-linear scales. In this study, we use the Illustris-TNG50 simulation to study the connection between the 2PCF signals of accreted halo stars and the assembly histories of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find, in general, the 2PCF signal increases with the increase in galactocentric radii, $r$, and with the decrease in the pair separations. Galaxies which assemble late on average have stronger 2PCF signals. With $z_{1/4}$, $z_{1/2}$ and $z_{3/4}$ defined as the redshifts when galaxies accreted one-fourth, half and three-fourths of their ex-situ stellar mass at today, we find all of them show the strongest correlations with the 2PCF signals at $r\sim0.2R_{200}$. $z_{3/4}$ shows the strongest correlations at all radii than those of $z_{1/4}$ or $z_{1/2}$, as later accreted stars preserve better clusterings. However, the correlations between the 2PCF signals at different radii and the galaxy formation times all have large scatters. The 2PCFs in velocity space show weaker correlations with the galaxy formation times within $0.38R_{200}$ than real space 2PCFs, and the scatter is considerably large. Both the real and velocity space 2PCFs correlate with the assembly histories of the host dark matter halos as well. Within $0.38R_{200}$, the real space 2PCF shows stronger correlations with the galaxy formation histories than with the halo formation histories, while the velocity space 2PCFs do not show large differences. We conclude that it is difficult to use 2PCF alone to precisely predict the formation times or assembly histories of galaxies.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Giant radio galaxies in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey-I,"Giant radio galaxies (GRGs) are a subclass of radio galaxies which have grown to megaparsec scales. GRGs are much rarer than normal sized radio galaxies (< 0.7 Mpc) and the reason for their gigantic sizes is still debated. Here, we report the biggest sample of GRGs identified to date. These objects were found in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) first data release images, which cover a 424 square degrees region. Of the 239 GRGs found, 225 are new discoveries. The GRGs in our sample have sizes ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 Mpc and have redshifts (z) between 0.1 and 2.3. Seven GRGs have sizes above 2 Mpc and one has a size of ~ 3.5 Mpc. The sample contains 40 GRGs hosted by spectroscopically confirmed quasars. Here, we present the search techniques employed and the resulting catalogue of the newly discovered large sample of GRGs along with their radio properties. We, here also show for the first time that the spectral index of GRGs is similar to that of normal sized radio galaxies, indicating that most of the GRG population is not dead or is not like remnant type radio galaxy. We find 20/239 GRGs in our sample are located at the centres of clusters and present our analysis on their cluster environment and radio morphology.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Yang-Mills glueball masses from spectral reconstruction,"We compute masses of the two lightest glueballs from spectral reconstructions of timelike interaction channels of the four-gluon vertex in Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory. The Euclidean spacelike dressings of the vertex are calculated with the functional renormalisation group. For the spectral reconstruction of these Euclidean data, we employ Gaussian process regression. The glueball resonances can be identified straightforwardly and we obtain $m_{sc} = 1870(75)~$ MeV as well as $m_{ps} = 2700(120)~$ MeV, in accordance with functional bound state and lattice calculations.",hep,hep-ph,\chi_{cJ} polarizations at the Fermilab Tevatron,"We propose the measurement of $\chi_{cJ}$ polarizations at high energy hadron colliders to study heavy quarkonium production mechanism. We find that the color-singlet model in the $k_t$ factorization approach predicts very different behavior for $\chi_{cJ}$ polarizations at the Fermilab Tevatron compared with the NRQCD predictions in the collinear parton model. In the color-singlet $k_t$ factorization approach, for both $\chi_{c1}$ and $\chi_{c2}$ productions, the helicity $h=0$ states dominate over other helicity states at large $p_T$. These properties are very useful in distinguishing between the two production mechanisms which are related to the interesting issue of $J\psi$ and $\psi'$ polarizations, and may provide a crucial test for the $k_t$ factorization approach.",hep,hep-ph,1
Baryonic Resonances from Baryon Decuplet-Meson Octet Interaction,"We study $S$-wave interactions of the baryon decuplet with the octet of pseudoscalar mesons using the lowest order chiral Lagrangian. In the S=1 sector, we find an attractive interaction in the $\Delta K$ channel with I=1 while it is repulsive for I=2. The attractive interaction leads to a pole in the second Riemann sheet of the complex plane and is manifested as a large strength in the scattering amplitude close to the $\Delta K$ threshold, which is not the case for I=2. We use the unitarized coupled channel approach to also investigate all the other possible values of strangeness and isospin. We find two bound states in the SU(3) limit corresponding to the octet and decuplet representations. These are found to split into eight different trajectories in the complex plane when the SU(3) symmetry is broken gradually. Finally, we are able to provide a reasonable description for a good number of 4-star ${{3/2}}^-$ resonances listed by the Particle Data Group. In particular, the $\Xi(1820)$, the $\Lambda(1520)$ and the $\Sigma(1670)$ states are well reproduced. We predict a few other resonances and also evaluate the couplings of the observed resonances to the various channels from the residues at the poles of the scattering matrix from where partial decay widths into different channels can be evaluated.",nucl,nucl-th,Nucleon electroweak form factors: Analysis of their spectral functions,"We investigate the imaginary parts of the nucleon electromagnetic and axial form factors close to threshold in the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. For the isovector electromagnetic form factors, we recover the well known strong enhancement near threshold. For the isoscalar ones, we show that there is no visible enhancement due to the three--pion continuum. This justifies the use of vector meson poles only in dispersion--theoretical calculations. We also calculate the imaginary part of the nucleon isovector axial form factor and show that it is small in the threshold region.",nucl,nucl-th,1
How prominent are microemulsion phases in 2D electron systems?,"In two-dimensional electronic systems, direct first-order phase transitions are prohibited as a consequence of the long-range Coulomb interaction, which implies a stiff energetic penalty for macroscopic phase separation. A prominent proposal is that any direct first-order transition is instead replaced by a sequence of ""microemulsion"" phases, in which the two phases are mixed in patterns of mesoscopic domains. In this note, we comment on the range $\Delta n$ of average electron density that such microemulsion phases may occupy. We point out that, even without knowing the value of a phenomenological parameter associated with surface tension between the two phases, one can place a fairly strong upper bound on the value of $\Delta n$. We make numerical estimates for $\Delta n$ in the case of the Fermi liquid to Wigner crystal transition and find $\Delta n$ to be on the order of $10^7$ cm$^{-2}$. This value is much smaller than the width of the phase transition observed in experiments, suggesting that disorder is a more likely explanation for the apparent broadening of the transition.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Synthetic Topological Qubits in Conventional Bilayer Quantum Hall Systems,"The idea of topological quantum computation is to build powerful and robust quantum computers with certain macroscopic quantum states of matter called topologically ordered states. These systems have degenerate ground states that can be used as robust ""topological qubits"" to store and process quantum information. However, a topological qubit has not been realized since the proposed systems either require sophisticated topologically ordered states that are not available yet, or require complicated geometries that are too difficult to realize. In this paper, we propose a new experimental setup which can realize topological qubits in a simple bilayer fractional quantum Hall (FQH) system with proper electric gate configurations. Compared to previous works, our proposal is accessible with current experimental techniques and only involves well-established topological states. Our system can realize a large class of topological qubits, generalizing the Majorana zero modes studied in the recent literature to more computationally powerful possibilities. We propose three tunneling and interferometry experiments to detect the existence and non-local topological properties of the topological qubits.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Quantum creation of traversable wormholes ex nihilo in Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton gravity,"We investigate a nucleation of a Euclidean wormhole and its analytic continuation to Lorentzian signatures in Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton gravity, where this model can be embedded by the type-II superstring theory. We show that there exists a Euclidean wormhole solution in this model by choosing a suitable shape of the dilaton potential. After the analytic continuation, this explains a quantum creation of a time-like traversable wormhole. Finally, we discuss relations to the information loss problem and the current literature.",hep,hep-th,Surface Operators in Superspace,"We generalize the geometrical formulation of Wilson loops recently introduced in arXiv:2003.01729v2 to the description of Wilson Surfaces. For N=(2,0) theory in six dimensions, we provide an explicit derivation of BPS Wilson Surfaces with non-trivial coupling to scalars, together with their manifestly supersymmetric version. We derive explicit conditions which allow to classify these operators in terms of the number of preserved supercharges. We also discuss kappa-symmetry and prove that BPS conditions in six dimensions arise from kappa-symmetry invariance in eleven dimensions. Finally, we discuss super-Wilson Surfaces - and higher dimensional operators - as objects charged under global $p$-form (super)symmetries generated by tensorial supercurrents. To this end, the construction of conserved supercurrents in supermanifolds and of the corresponding conserved charges is developed in details.",hep,hep-th,1
Heterogeneous Dynamics in Columnar Liquid Crystals of Parallel Hard Rods,"In the wake of previous studies on the rattling-and-jumping diffusion in smectic liquid crystal phases of colloidal rods, we analyze here for the first time the heterogeneous dynamics in columnar phases. More specifically, we perform computer simulations to investigate the relaxation dynamics of a binary mixture of perfectly aligned hard spherocylinders. We detect that the columnar arrangement of the system produces free-energy barriers the particles should overcome to jump from one column to another, thus determining a hopping-type diffusion. This phenomenon accounts for the non-Gaussian inter-column diffusion and shows a two-step structural relaxation which is remarkably analogous to that of out-of-equilibrium glass-forming systems and gels. Surprisingly enough, slight deviations from the behavior of simple liquids due to transient cages is also observed in the direction perpendicular to this plane, where the system is usually referred to as liquid-like.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,"""Cooling by heating"" - demonstrating the significance of the longitudinal specific heat","Heating a solid sphere at the surface induces mechanical stresses inside the sphere. If a finite amount of heat is supplied, the stresses gradually disappear as temperature becomes homogeneous throughout the sphere. We show that before this happens, there is a temporary lowering of pressure and density in the interior of the sphere, inducing a transient lowering of the temperature here. For ordinary solids this effect is small because c_p is almost equal to c_V. For fluent liquids the effect is negligible because their dynamic shear modulus vanishes. For a liquid at its glass transition, however, the effect is generally considerably larger than in solids. This paper presents analytical solutions of the relevant coupled thermoviscoelastic equations. In general, there is a difference between the isobaric specific heat, c_p, measured at constant isotropic pressure and the longitudinal specific heat, c_l, pertaining to mechanical boundary conditions that confine the associated expansion to be longitudinal. In the exact treatment of heat propagation the heat diffusion constant contains c_l rather than c_p. We show that the key parameter controlling the magnitude of the ""cooling-by-heating"" effect is the relative difference between these two specific heats. For a typical glass-forming liquid, when temperature at the surface is increased by 1 K, a lowering of the temperature in the sphere center of order 5 mK is expected if the experiment is performed at the glass transition. The cooling-by-heating effect is confirmed by measurements on a 19 mm diameter glucose sphere at the glass transition.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Constraining models with a large scalar multiplet,"Models in which the Higgs sector is extended by a single electroweak scalar multiplet X can possess an accidental global U(1) symmetry at the renormalizable level if X has isospin T greater or equal to 2. We show that all such U(1)-symmetric models are excluded by the interplay of the cosmological relic density of the lightest (neutral) component of X and its direct detection cross section via Z exchange. The sole exception is the T=2 multiplet, whose lightest member decays on a few-day to few-year timescale via a Planck-suppressed dimension-5 operator.",hep,hep-ph,GUT inspired $SO(5) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ gauge-Higgs unification,"$SO(5) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ gauge-Higgs unification model inspired by $SO(11)$ gauge-Higgs grand unification is constructed in the Randall-Sundrum warped space.

Proca in the sky,"The standard model of cosmology, the $\Lambda$CDM model, describes the evolution of the Universe since the Big Bang with just a few parameters, six in its basic form. Despite being the simplest model, direct late-time measurements of the Hubble constant compared with the early-universe measurements result in the so-called $H_0$ tension. It is claimed that a late time resolution is predestined to fail when different cosmological probes are combined. In this work, we shake the ground of this belief with a very simple model. We show how, in the context of cubic vector Galileon models, the Hubble tension can naturally be relieved using a combination of CMB, BAO and SNe observations without using any prior on $H_0$ . The tension can be reduced even further by including the local measurement of the Hubble constant.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,An Isolated HII Region near ESO 481-G017,We obtained VLA 21-cm observations of the galaxy ESO 481-G017 to determine the environment and trigger of remote star formation traced by a HII region found 43 kpc from the galaxy (in projection). ESO 481-G017 is an early type spiral galaxy with a HI mass of 1.1*10^9 Msun and a distance of 55 Mpc. The isolated HII region has a H-alpha luminosity of 10^38.1 erg s^-1 and minimal continuum emission suggesting that new stars have formed where little or no stars previously existed. The difference in velocity between the HI disk of ESO 481-G017 (3840-4000 km s^-1) and the isolated HII region (4701 +/- 80 km s^-1) indicates the origin of the HII region may be stars forming in a tidal feature or newly triggered star formation in a very low luminosity companion galaxy.

A fluctuation theorem for currents and non-linear response coefficients,"We use a recently proved fluctuation theorem for the currents to develop the response theory of nonequilibrium phenomena.

Activated structural relaxation is described as a coupled local-nonlocal event involving caging and longer-range collective elasticity which controls the characteristic stress relaxation time. Theoretical predictions for the deformation-induced mobility enhancement, onset of relaxation acceleration at low values of stress, strain, or shear-rate, apparent power-law thinning of the steady-state structural relaxation time and viscosity, a non-vanishing activation barrier in the shear-thinning regime, an apparent Herschel-Bulkley form of the rate dependence of the steady-state shear stress, exponential growth of different measures of a dynamic yield or flow-stress with packing fraction, and reduced fragility and dynamic heterogeneity under deformation were previously shown to be in good agreement with experiment. The central new question addressed here is the defining feature of the transient response - the stress-overshoot. In contrast to the steady-state flow regime, understanding the transient response requires an explicit treatment of the coupled nonequilibrium evolution of structure, elastic modulus, and stress relaxation time. We formulate a new quantitative model for this aspect in a physically motivated and computationally tractable manner. Theoretical predictions for the stress-overshoot are shown to be in good agreement with experimental observations in the metastable ultra-dense regime of hard-sphere colloidal suspensions as a function of shear-rate and packing fraction, and accounting for deformation-assisted activated motion is crucial for both the transient and steady-state responses.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
Superconductivity in Inhomogeneous Hubbard Models,"We present a controlled perturbative approach to the low temperature phase diagram of highly inhomogeneous Hubbard models in the limit of small coupling, $t'$, between clusters. We apply this to the dimerized and checkerboard models. The dimerized model is found to behave like a doped semiconductor, with a Fermi-liquid groundstate with parameters ({\it e.g.} the effective mass) which are smooth functions of the Hubbard interaction, $U$. By contrast, the checkerboard model has a nodeless d-wave superconducting state (preformed pair condensate, $d$-BEC) for $0 < U < U_c$, which smoothly crosses over to an intermediate BCS-like superconducting phase ($d$-BCS), also with no nodal quasi-particles, for $|U - U_c| < {\cal O}(t^\prime)$, which gives way to a Fermi liquid phase at large $U > U_c = 4.58$.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Ground state fidelity from tensor network representations,"For any D-dimensional quantum lattice system, the fidelity between two ground state many-body wave functions is mapped onto the partition function of a D-dimensional classical statistical vertex lattice model with the same lattice geometry.

The Interfacial Structure of InP(100) in Contact with HCl and H$_2$SO$_4$ studied by Reflection Anisotropy Spectroscopy,"Indium phosphide and derived compound semiconductors are materials often involved in high-efficiency solar water splitting due to their versatile opto-electronic properties. Surface corrosion, however, typically deteriorates the performance of photoelectrochemical solar cells based on this material class. It has been reported that (photo)electrochemical surface functionalisation protects the surface by combining etching and controlled corrosion. Nevertheless, the overall involved process is not fully understood. Therefore, access to the electrochemical interface structure under operando conditions is crucial for a more detailed understanding. One approach for gaining structural insight is the use of operando reflection anisotropy spectroscopy. This technique allows the time-resolved investigation of the interfacial structure while applying potentials in the electrolyte. In this study, p-doped InP(100) surfaces are cycled between anodic and cathodic potentials in two different electrolytes, hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid. For low, 10 mM electrolyte concentrations, we observe a reversible processes related to the reduction of a surface oxide phase in the cathodic potential range which is reformed near open-circuit potentials. Higher concentrations of 0.5 N, however, already lead to initial surface corrosion.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,A Review of Liquid Phase Epitaxial Grown Gallium Arsenide,"Liquid phase epitaxy of gallium arsenide (LPE GaAs) has been investigated intensively from the late 1960's to the present and has now a special place in the manufacture of wide band, compound semiconductor radiation detectors. Although this particular process appears to have gained prominence in the last three decades, it is interesting to note that its origins reach back to 1836 when Frankenheim made his first observations. A brief review is presented from a semiconductor applications point of view on how this subject developed. This is followed by a report on LPE GaAs growth at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO).",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Triangular pair density wave in confined superfluid $^3$He,"Recent advances in experiment and theory suggest that superfluid $^3$He under planar confinement may form a pair density wave (PDW) whereby superfluid and crystalline orders coexist. While a natural candidate for this phase is a unidirectional stripe phase predicted by Vorontsov and Sauls in 2007, recent nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of the superfluid order parameter rather suggest a two-dimensional PDW with noncollinear wavevectors, of possibly square or hexagonal symmetry. In this Letter, we present a general mechanism by which a PDW with the symmetry of a triangular lattice can be stabilized, based on a superfluid generalization of Landau's theory of the liquid-solid transition. A soft-mode instability at finite wavevector within the translationally invariant planar-distorted B phase triggers a transition from uniform superfluid to PDW that is first order due to a cubic term generally present in the PDW free-energy functional. This cubic term also lifts the degeneracy of possible PDW states in favor of those for which wavevectors add to zero in triangles, which in two dimensions uniquely selects the triangular lattice.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,Untying the insulating and superconducting orders in magic-angle graphene,"The coexistence of superconducting and correlated insulating states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene prompts fascinating questions about the relationship of these orders. Independent control of the microscopic mechanisms governing these phases could help uncover their individual roles and shed light on their intricate interplay. Here we report on direct tuning of electronic interactions in this system by changing its separation from a metallic screening layer. We observe quenching of correlated insula-tors in devices with screening layer separations that are smaller than a typical Wannier orbital size of 15nm, and with the twist angles slightly deviating from the magic value 1.10 plus(minus) 0.05 degrees. Upon extinction of the insulating orders, the vacated phase space is taken over by superconducting domes that feature critical temperatures comparable to those in the devices with strong insulators. In addition, we find that insulators at half-filling can reappear in small out-of-plane magnetic fields of 0.4 T, giving rise to quantized Hall states with a Chern number of 2. Our study suggests reexamination of the often-assumed mother-child relation between the insulating and superconducting phases in moire graphene, and illustrates a new approach to directly probe microscopic mechanisms of superconductivity in strongly-correlated systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,1
Identification of Majorana Modes in Interacting Systems by Local Integrals of Motion,"Recently, there has been substantial progress in methods of identifying local integrals of motion in interacting integrable models or in systems with many-body localization. We show that one of these approaches can be utilized for constructing local, conserved, Majorana fermions in systems with an arbitrary many-body interaction. As a test case, we first investigate a non-interacting Kitaev model and demonstrate that this approach perfectly reproduces the standard results. Then, we discuss how the many-body interactions influence the spatial structure and the lifetime of the Majorana modes. Finally, we determine the regime for which the information stored in the Majorana correlators is also retained for arbitrarily long times at high temperatures. We show that it is included in the regime with topologically protected soft Majorana modes, but in some cases is significantly smaller.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Spin-gapped incoherent metal with preformed pairing in the doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator,"We investigate how the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator evolves into the d-wave BCS superconductor through hole doping. Allowing spin fluctuations in the strong coupling approach, we find a spin-gapped incoherent metal with preformed pairing as an intermediate phase between the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator and d-wave superconductor. This non-Fermi liquid metal is identified with an infrared stable fixed point in the spin-decomposition gauge theory, analogous to the spin liquid insulator in the slave-boson gauge theory. We consider the single particle spectrum and dynamical spin susceptibility in the anomalous metallic phase, and discuss physical implications.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Theoretical Remarks on Cybotactic Clusters of Bent-Core Nematic Liquid Crystals in 1D Settings,"The bent-core liquid crystals (LCs) are highly regarded as the next-generation materials for electro-optic devices. The nematic (N) phase of these LCs possesses highly ordered smectic-like cybotactic clusters which are promising in terms of ferroelectric-like behaviour in the N phase itself. We have studied a one-dimensional (1D) Landau-deGennes model of spatially inhomogeneous order parameters for the N phase of bent-core LCs. We investigate the effects of spatial confinement and coupling (between these clusters and the surrounding LC molecules) on the order parameters to model cluster formation in recently reported experiments. The coupling is found to increase the cluster order parameter significantly, suggesting an enhancement in the cluster formation and could also predict a possible transition to a phase with weak nematic-like ordering in the vicinity of nematic-isotropic transition upon appreciable increase of the coupling parameter {\gamma}.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Two-temperature activity induces liquid-crystal phases inaccessible in equilibrium,"In equilibrium hard-rod fluids, and in effective hard-rod descriptions of anisotropic soft-particle systems, the transition from the isotropic (I) phase to the nematic phase (N) is observed above the rod aspect ratio L/D = 3.70 as predicted by Onsager. We examine the fate of this criterion in a molecular dynamics study of a system of soft repulsive spherocylinders rendered active by coupling half the particles to a heat bath at a higher temperature than that imposed on the other half. We show that the system phase separates and self-organizes into various liquid-crystalline phases that are not observed in equilibrium for the respective aspect ratios. In particular, we find a nematic phase for L/D = 3 and a smectic phase for L/D = 2 above a critical activity.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Coulomb field correction due to virtual $e^+e^-$ production in heavy ion collisions,"The correction to the Coulomb energy due to virtual production of $e^+e^-$ pairs, which is on the order of one percent of the Coulomb energy at nuclear scales is discussed. The effects of including a pair-production term in the semi-empirical mass formula and the correction to the Coulomb barrier for a handful of nuclear collisions using the Bass and Coulomb potentials are studied. With an eye toward future work using Constrained Molecular Dynamics (CoMD) model, we also calculate the correction to the Coulomb energy and force between protons after folding with a Gaussian spatial distribution.",nucl,nucl-ex,Impact of Multiplicity Fluctuations on Entropy Scaling Across System Size,"The initial state is one of the greatest uncertainties in heavy-ion collisions. A model-agnostic approach is taken in the phenomenological Trento framework which constrains parameters using Bayesian analysis. However, the color-glass condensate (CGC) effective theory predicts initial energy densities that lie outside the recent Bayesian analyses due, in part, to the assumption in Trento of event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations following a $\Gamma$ distribution. We compare the Trento-preferred $\sqrt{T_{A}T_{B}}$ scaling to CGC-like $T_{A}T_{B}$ scaling coupled with log-normal fluctuations in $AuAu$ and $dAu$ collisions and find there is a significant impact on the multiplicity distributions and on the eccentricities, which may affect the extraction of viscosity in small systems.",nucl,nucl-ex,1
Geometric dephasing-limited Hanle effect in long-distance lateral silicon spin transport devices,"Evidence of spin precession and dephasing (""Hanle effect"") induced by an external magnetic field is the only unequivocal proof of spin-polarized conduction electron transport in semiconductor devices. However, when spin dephasing is very strong, Hanle effect in a uniaxial magnetic field can be impossible to measure. Using a Silicon device with lateral injector-detector separation over 2 millimeters, and geometrically-induced dephasing making spin transport completely incoherent, we show experimentally and theoretically that Hanle effect can still be measured using a two-axis magnetic field.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,"Magnetism of mixed quaternary Heusler alloys: (Ni,T)$_{2}$MnSn (T=Cu,Pd) as a case study","The electronic properties, exchange interactions, finite-temperature magnetism, and transport properties of random quaternary Heusler Ni$_{2}$MnSn alloys doped with Cu- and Pd-atoms are studied theoretically by means of {\it ab initio} calculations over the entire range of dopant concentrations. While the magnetic moments are only weakly dependent on the alloy composition, the Curie temperatures exhibit strongly non-linear behavior with respect to Cu-doping in contrast with an almost linear concentration dependence in the case of Pd-doping. The present parameter-free theory agrees qualitatively and also reasonably well quantitatively with the available experimental results. An analysis of exchange interactions is provided for a deeper understanding of the problem. The dopant atoms perturb electronic structure close to the Fermi energy only weakly and the residual resistivity thus obeys a simple Nordheim rule. The dominating contribution to the temperature-dependent resistivity is due to thermodynamical fluctuations originating from the spin-disorder, which, according to our calculations, can be described successfully via the disordered local moments model. Results based on this model agree fairly well with the measured values of spin-disorder induced resistivity.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,1
Valence and Spin fluctuations in Mn-doped ferroelectric BaTiO3,"We study Mn substitution for Ti in BaTiO3 with and without compensating oxygen vacancies using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). We find strong charge and spin fluctuations. Without compensating oxygen vacancies, the ground state is found to be a quantum superposition of two distinct atomic valences, 3d4 and 3d5. Introducing a compensating oxygen vacancy at a neighboring site reduces both charge and spin fluctuations due to the reduction of electron hopping from Mn to its ligands. As a consequence, valence fluctuations are reduced, and is closely fixed to the high spin 3d5 state. Here we show that inclusion of charge and spin fluctuations is necessary to obtain an accurate ground state of transition metal doped ferroelectrics.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Valley lifetimes of conduction band electrons in monolayer WSe$_2$,"One of the main tasks in the investigation of 2-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is the determination of valley lifetimes. In this work, we combine time-resolved Kerr rotation with electrical transport measurements to explore the gate-dependent valley lifetimes of free conduction band electrons of monolayer WSe$_2$. When tuning the Fermi energy into the conduction band we observe a strong decrease of the respective valley lifetimes which is consistent with both spin-orbit and electron-phonon scattering. We explain the formation of a valley polarization by the scattering of optically excited valley polarized bright trions into dark states by intervalley scattering. Furthermore, we show that the conventional time-resolved Kerr rotation measurement scheme has to be modified to account for photo-induced gate screening effects. Disregarding this adaptation can lead to erroneous conclusions drawn from gate-dependent optical measurements and can completely mask the true gate-dependent valley dynamics.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Unified trade-off optimization of a three-level quantum refrigerator,"We study the optimal performance of a three-level quantum refrigerator using a trade-off objective function, $\Omega$ function, which represents a compromise between the energy benefits and the energy losses of a thermal device. First, we optimize the performance of our refrigerator by employing a two-parameter optimization scheme and show that the first two-terms in the series expansion of the obtained coefficient of performance (COP) match with those of some classical models of refrigerator. Then, in the high-temperature limit, optimizing with respect to one parameter while constraining the other one, we obtain the lower and upper bounds on the COP for both strong as well as weak (intermediate) matter-field coupling conditions. In the strong matter-field coupling regime, the obtained bounds on the COP exactly match with the bounds already known for some models of classical refrigerators. Further for weak matter-field coupling, we derive some new bounds on the the COP of the refrigerator which lie beyond the range covered by bounds obtained for strong matter-field coupling. Finally, in the parameter regime where both cooling power and $\Omega$ function can be maximized, we compare the cooling power of the quantum refrigerator at maximum $\Omega$ function with the maximum cooling power.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Entanglement Properties of a Higher-Integer-Spin AKLT Model with Quantum Group Symmetry,"We study the entanglement properties of a higher-integer-spin Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model with quantum group symmetry in the periodic boundary condition. We exactly calculate the finite size correction terms of the entanglement entropies from the double scaling limit. We also evaluate the geometric entanglement, which serves as another measure for entanglement. We find the geometric entanglement reaches its maximum at the isotropic point, and decreases with the increase of the anisotropy. This behavior is similar to that of the entanglement entropies.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
$\rho$-Meson Production and Decay in Proton-Nucleus Collisions,"We analyze the production of $\rho$-mesons in $p + A$ reactions including both the production by proton-nucleon as well as pion-nucleon collisions within a coupled channel transport approach. The final state interactions of the $\rho$-meson with nucleons are evaluated from a resonance model which allows to extract elastic and inelastic cross sections. We include the latter final state interactions, the $\rho$-meson decay into two pions as well as the final pion-nucleon interactions within the transport approach. We find the invariant mass distribution of pion pairs to be sensitive to the $\rho$-meson properties in the nuclear medium. However, due to the strong final state interactions of pions only light targets like $^{12}C$ might be suited to extract a $\rho$-signal from the uncorrelated two pion background which carries information about the in-medium properties of the $\rho$-meson.",nucl,nucl-th,Tomography of the Quark Gluon Plasma by Heavy Quarks,"Using the recently published model \cite{Gossiaux:2008jv,goss2} for the collisional energy loss of heavy quarks in a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), based on perturbative QCD (pQCD), we study the centrality dependence of $R_{AA}$ and $R_{AA}(p_T^{min})$, %= \frac{dN_{AA}/dp_T}{<N_{binary}> dN_{pp}/dp_T}$ measured by the Phenix collaboration, and compare our model with other approaches based on pQCD and on Anti de Sitter/ Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT)",nucl,nucl-th,1
NMSSM with Gravitino Dark Matter to be tested at LHC,"We present a solution to the gravitino problem, which arises in the NMSSM, allowing for sparticle spectra from ordinary gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking with weak-scale gravitino dark matter. The coupling, which links the singlet to the MSSM sector, enhances the tree-level Higgs mass, providing an attractive explanation why the observed Higgs boson is so heavy. The same coupling induces very efficient pair-annihilation processes of the neutralino NLSP. Its relic abundance can be sufficiently suppressed to satisfy the strong constraints on late decaying relics from primordial nucleosynthesis -- even for very long neutralino lifetimes. The striking prediction of this scenario is the detection of a pseudoscalar Higgs boson in the search for top-top resonances at LHC-14, rendering it completely testable.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Stellar population and the origin of intra-cluster stars around brightest cluster galaxies: the case of NGC 3311,"Context. We investigate the stellar population and the origin of diffuse light around brightest cluster galaxies. Aims. We study the stellar population of the dynamically hot stellar halo of NGC 3311, the brightest galaxy in the Hydra I cluster, and that of photometric substructures in the diffuse light to constrain the origin of these components. Methods. We analyze absorption lines in medium-resolution, long-slit spectra in the wavelength range 4800-5800 angstrom obtained with FORS2 at the Very Large Telescope. We measure the equivalent width of Lick indices out to 20 kpc from the center of NGC 3311 and fit them with stellar population models that account for the [alpha/Fe] overabundance. Results. Stars in the dynamically hot halo of NGC 3311 are old (age > 13 Gyr), metal-poor ([Z/H] ~ -0.35), and alpha-enhanced ([alpha/Fe] ~ 0.48). Together with the high velocity dispersion, these measurements indicate that the stars in the halo were accreted from the outskirts of other early-type galaxies, with a possible contribution from dwarf galaxies. We identify a region in the halo of NGC 3311 associated with a photometric substructure where the stellar population is even more metal-poor ([Z/H] ~ -0.73). In this region, our measurements are consistent with a composite stellar population superposed along the line of sight, consisting of stars from the dynamically hot halo of NGC 3311 and stars stripped from dwarf galaxies. The latter component contributes < 28% to the local surface brightness. Conclusions. The build-up of diffuse light around NGC 3311 is on-going. Based on the observed stellar population properties, the dominant part of these stars may have come from the outskirts of bright early-type galaxies, while stars from stripped dwarf galaxies are presently being added.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
The dangers of being trigger--happy,"We examine the evidence offered for triggered star formation against the backdrop provided by recent numerical simulations of feedback from massive stars at or below giant molecular cloud sizescales. We compile a catalogue of sixty--seven observational papers, mostly published over the last decade, and examine the signposts most commonly used to infer the presence of triggered star formation. We then determine how well these signposts perform in a recent suite of hydrodynamic simulations of star formation including feedback from O--type stars performed by Dale et al (2012a, b, 2013a, b, 2014). We find that none of the observational markers improve the chances of correctly identifying a given star as triggered by more than factors of two at most. This limits the fidelity of these techniques in interpreting star formation histories. We therefore urge caution in interpreting observations of star formation near feedback--driven structures in terms of triggering.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Interstellar objects follow the collapse of molecular clouds,"Interstellar objects (ISOs), the parent population of 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, are abundant in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way. This means that the interstellar medium, including molecular cloud regions, has three components: gas, dust, and ISOs. From the observational constraints for the field density of ISOs drifting in the solar neighbourhood, we infer a typical molecular cloud of 10 pc diameter contains some 10$^{18}$ ISOs. At typical sizes ranging from hundreds of metres to tens of km, ISOs are entirely decoupled from the gas dynamics in these molecular clouds. Here we address the question of whether ISOs can follow the collapse of molecular clouds. We perform low-resolution simulations of the collapse of molecular clouds containing initially static ISO populations toward the point where stars form. In this proof-of-principle study, we find that the interstellar objects definitely follow the collapse of the gas -- and many become bound to the new-forming numerical approximations to future stars (sinks). At minimum, 40\% of all sinks have one or more ISO test particles gravitationally bound to them for the initial ISO distributions tested here. This value corresponds to at least $10^{10}$ actual interstellar objects being bound after three initial free-fall times. Thus, ISOs are a relevant component of star formation. We find that more massive sinks bind disproportionately large fractions of the initial ISO population, implying competitive capture of ISOs. Sinks can also be solitary, as their ISOs can become unbound again -- particularly if sinks are ejected from the system. Emerging planetary systems will thus develop in remarkably varied environments, ranging from solitary to richly populated with bound ISOs.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Metastable tight knots in a worm-like polymer,"Based on an estimate of the knot entropy of a worm-like chain we predict that the interplay of bending energy and confinement entropy will result in a compact metastable configuration of the knot that will diffuse, without spreading, along the contour of the semi-flexible polymer until it reaches one of the chain ends. Our estimate of the size of the knot as a function of its topological invariant (ideal aspect ratio) agrees with recent experimental results of knotted dsDNA. Further experimental tests of our ideas are proposed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Thermodynamic Modelling of Phase Equilibrium in Nanoparticles-Nematic Liquid Crystals Composites,"In this work, a theoretical study of phase equilibrium in mixtures of a calamitic nematic liquid crystal and hard spherical nanoparticles is presented. A mean-field thermodynamic model is used, where the interactions are considered to be proportional to the number of contacts, which in turn are proportional to the areas and area fractions of each component. It is shown that, as the radius of the particle is increased, the effect of the particles on the isotropic-nematic transition is less pronounced, and that for large radius the miscibility increases as the particle radius increases.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Line Formation of Raman-Scattered He II $\lambda$ 4851 in an Expanding Spherical H I Shell in Young Planetary Nebulae,"We investigate line formation of Raman-scattered He II at 4851 in an expanding neutral spherical shell that surrounds a point-like He II source located at the center. A new grid-based Monte Carlo code is used to take into consideration the H I density variation along each photon path. In the case of a monochromatic He II emission source, the resultant line profiles are characterized by an asymmetric double peak structure with a tertiary peak and a significant red tail that may extend to line centers of He II$\lambda$4859 and H$\beta$. The peak separation corresponds to the expansion velocity, which we consider is in the range $20-40{\rm\ km\ s^{-1}}$ in this work. Tertiary red peaks are formed as a result of multiple Rayleigh reflections at the inner surface of a hollow spherical shell of \ion{H}{1}. Due to a sharp increase of scattering cross section near resonance, the overall Raman conversion efficiency is significantly enhanced as the expansion speed increases. In the case of a He II line source with a Gaussian line profile with a full width at half maximum of $30 - 70{\rm\ km\ s^{-1}}$, we obtain distorted redward profiles due to increasing redward cross section of H I. A simple application to the young planetary nebula IC 5117 is consistent with a neutral shell expanding with a speed $\sim 30{\rm\ km\ s^{-1}}$.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,A cycle of measurements of the solar semidiameter with the astrolabe of Rio de Janeiro (1998-2009),"The solar astrolabe at Observatorio Nacional has been doing a series of solar semidiameter measurements, extending from 1998 up to 2009, to a total of 21640 observations of the Sun. Using the data series it was established the solar radius variation along that period, as well as determining results about the change of the solar ellipticity. To the work in perspective, the measurements of the solar radius in the past four centuries are reviewed, followed by a more detailed account of the contemporaneous measurements. The deviations of the observed values from the true values caused by observational and instrumental effects are studied and the strategies used to derive the corresponding corrections are shown. The relationships linking the variation of the semidiameter and the relevant indexes of the solar activity are analyzed. Finally, the time series from Observatorio Nacional was enchained to all the other similar astrolabe series, from which the data were graciously confided to this work. Using such much longer combined data set it was established the long term behavior of the solar semidiameter along the last three solar cycles. The outcome is a strong correlation to the long period features of the solar activity described by the annual mean of sunspots count. Putting together the long term semidiameter variation and other solar evidences we point out the near approach of a deep minimum of sunspots.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
"Formation of $\eta$-mesic Nuclei Using the Recoilless (d,$^3$He) Reaction","We propose to use the recoilless (d,$^3$He) reaction to produce $\eta$-mesic nuclei. This reaction has been used to observe deeply bound pionic states and proven to be powerful recently. We calculate $\eta$-mesic bound states in the nucleus using an optical potential and their formation cross section with the Green function method. Then, we carefully check the experimental feasibility. We find that $\eta$-mesic nuclei can be observed experimentally using the (d,$^3$He) reaction.

Energy level statistics are investigated with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method in order to characterize transitional region. Eigenvalues of these systems are obtained by solving Bethe-Ansatz equations with least square fitting processes to experimental data to obtain constants of Hamiltonian. Our obtained results verify the dependence of Nearest Neighbor Spacing Distribution's (NNSD) parameter to control parameter (c_{s}) and also display chaotic behavior of transitional regions in comparing with both limits. In order to compare our results for two limits with both GUE and GOE ensembles, we have suggested a new NNSD distribution and have obtained better KLD distances for the new distribution in compared with others in both limits.

Localization properties of Chern insulators,"We study the localization properties of the equal-time electron Green's function in a Chern insulator in an arbitrary dimension and with an arbitrary number of bands. We prove that the Green's function cannot decay super-exponentially if the Hamiltonian is finite-range and the quantum Hall response is nonzero. For a general band Hamiltonian (possibly infinite-range), we prove that the Green's function cannot be finite-range if the quantum Hall response is nonzero. The proofs use methods of algebraic geometry.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Thermal drag in electronic conductors,"We study the electronic thermal drag in two different Coulomb-coupled systems, the first one composed of two Coulomb blockaded metallic islands and the second one consisting of two parallel quantum wires. The two conductors of each system are electrically isolated and placed in the two circuits (the drive and the drag) of a four-electrode setup. The systems are biased, either by a temperature $\Delta T$ or a voltage $V$ difference, on the drive circuit, while no biases are present on the drag circuit. In the case of a pair of metallic islands we use a master equation approach to determine the general properties of the dragged heat current $I^{\rm (h)}_{\rm drag}$, accounting also for co-tunneling contributions and the presence of large biases. Analytic results are obtained in the sequential tunneling regime for small biases, finding, in particular, that $I^{\rm (h)}_{\rm drag}$ is quadratic in $\Delta T$ or $V$ and non-monotonous as a function of the inter-island coupling. Finally, by replacing one of the electrodes in the drag circuit with a superconductor, we find that heat can be extracted from the other normal electrode. In the case of the two interacting quantum wires, using the Luttinger liquid theory and the bosonization technique, we derive an analytic expression for the thermal trans-resistivity $\rho^{\rm (h)}_{12}$, in the weak-coupling limit and at low temperatures. $\rho^{\rm (h)}_{12}$ turns out to be proportional to the electric trans-resistivity $\rho^{\rm (c)}_{12}$, in such a way that their ratio (a kind of Wiedemann-Franz law) is proportional to $T^3$. We find that the thermal trans-resistivity is proportional to $T$ for low temperatures and decreases like $1/T$ for intermediate temperatures or like $1/T^3$ for high temperatures. We complete our analyses by performing numerical simulations that confirm the above results and allow to access the strong coupling regime.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Valley-Contrasting Orbital Magnetic Moment Induced Negative Magnetoresistance,"The valley-contrasting orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons allows the lifting of valley degeneracy by an out-of-plane magnetic field. We demonstrate that this leads to negative magnetoresistance, utilizing a gapped two-dimensional multi-valley model as an example. An intuitive physical picture in terms of the increased carrier density from a magnetic gating effect is proposed for this negative magnetoresistance. In particular, giant negative magnetoresistance is achieved after one of the two valleys is depleted by the magnetic field. This new mechanism of negative magnetoresistance is argued to be relevant in ionic-liquid gated gapped graphene with small effective mass.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Ru$_{2-x}$Mn$_{1+x}$Al thin films,"The cubic Heusler alloy Ru$_{2-x}$Mn$_{1+x}$Al is grown in thin film form on MgO and MgAl$_2$O$_4$ substrates.

Although structurally and chemically similar to $\text{Mn}_2\text{Ru}_x\text{Ga}$, it does not exhibit ferrimagnetic compensation, or large magneto galvanic effects.

Correlation functions with Karsten-Wilczek fermions,"The Karsten-Wilczek action describes two chiral fermions but breaks the symmetries under both charge conjugation ($ \widehat{C}) $ and time reflection ($ \widehat{\Theta} $) explicitly, though invariance under $ \widehat{C\Theta} $ and a mirror fermion symmetry $ \widehat{T\Theta} $ are maintained. These proceedings outline how the action's symmetries and the presence of the second fermion emerge in mesonic correlation functions. The residual symmetries explain the non-observation of broken time-reflection symmetry in a class of mesonic correlation functions. Time-reflection symmetry is enforced for correlation functions that are manifestly invariant under $ \widehat{C} $ or $ \widehat{T} $. Due to contributions from the second fermion, oscillating contributions arise in some mesonic correlation functions. A second condition for non-perturbative tuning of the relevant counterterm is obtained from these oscillations. Both non-perturbative tuning conditions are independent and agree within errors. Due to contributions from the second fermion, additional pseudoscalar states are observed in non-standard channels. Mass splittings between these additional states and the Goldstone boson vanish as $ \mathcal{O}(a^2) $.",hep,hep-lat,0+ and 1+ heavy-light exotic mesons at N2LO in the chiral limit,"We use QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR) and the factorization properties of molecule and four-quark currents to estimate the masses and couplings of the 0+ and 1+ molecules and four-quark at N2LO of PT QCD.

Within the Laplace sum rules approach (LSR) and in the MS-scheme, we summarize our results in Table 2, which agree within the errors with some of the observed XZ-like molecules or/and four-quark.

Correlations of Baryon and Charge Stopping in Heavy Ion Collisions,"Baryon numbers are carried by valence quarks in the standard QCD picture of the baryon structure, while some theory proposed an alternative baryon number carrier, a non-perturbative Y-shaped configuration of the gluon field, called the baryon junction in the 1970s. However, neither of the theories has been verified experimentally. It was recently suggested to search for the baryon junction by investigating the correlation of net-charge and net-baryon yields at midrapidity in heavy-ion collisions. This paper presents studies of such correlations in collisions of various heavy ions from Oxygen to Uranium with the UrQMD Monte Carlo model. The UrQMD model implements valence quark transport as the primary means of charge and baryon stopping at midrapidity. Detailed study are also carried out for isobaric $_{40}^{96}\mathrm{Zr}$ + $_{40}^{96}\mathrm{Zr}$ and $_{44}^{96}\mathrm{Ru}$ + $_{44}^{96}\mathrm{Ru}$ collisions. We found a universal trend of the charge stopping with respect to the baryon stopping, and that the charge stopping is always more than the baryon stopping. This study provides a model baseline in valence quark transport for what is expected in net-charge and net-baryon yields at midrapidity of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.",nucl,nucl-th,QCD inequalities for hadron interactions,"We derive generalisations of the Weingarten--Witten QCD mass inequalities for particular multi-hadron systems.

Similar constraints in less symmetric systems are also extracted. These results are compatible with experimental results (where known) and recent lattice QCD calculations, and also lead to a more stringent bound on the nucleon mass than previously derived, $m_N \ge 3/2 m_\pi$.",nucl,nucl-th,1

The Bragg spectroscopy is employed to determine the critical temperature and the condensate fraction after a fast magnetic field ramp to the molecular side of the Feshbach resonance. Our measurements reveal the level-off of the critical temperature and the limiting behavior of condensate fraction near the unitarity limit.,cond-mat,cond-mat.other,Quantum Many-Body Phenomena in Coupled Cavity Arrays,"The increasing level of experimental control over atomic and optical systems gained in the past years have paved the way for the exploration of new physical regimes in quantum optics and atomic physics, characterised by the appearance of quantum many-body phenomena, originally encountered only in condensed-matter physics, and the possibility of experimentally accessing them in a more controlled manner. In this review article we survey recent theoretical studies concerning the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to create quantum many-body systems. Based on recent experimental progress in the fabrication of arrays of interacting micro-cavities and on their coupling to atomic-like structures in several different physical architectures, we review proposals on the realisation of paradigmatic many-body models in such systems, such as the Bose-Hubbard and the anisotropic Heisenberg models. Such arrays of coupled cavities offer interesting properties as simulators of quantum many-body physics, including the full addressability of individual sites and the accessibility of inhomogeneous models.",cond-mat,cond-mat.other,1
Techniques for High Contrast Imaging in Multi-Star Systems I: Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control,"Extra-solar planets direct imaging is now a reality with the deployment and commissioning of the first generation of specialized ground-based instruments (GPI, SPHERE, P1640 and SCExAO). These systems allow of planets $ 10 ^ 7 $ times fainter than their host star. For space-based missions (EXCEDE, EXO-C, EXO-S, WFIRST), various teams have demonstrated laboratory contrasts reaching $ 10 ^ { -10 } $ within a few diffraction limits from the star. However, all of these current and future systems are designed to detect faint planets around a single host star or unresolved multiples, while most non M-dwarf stars such as Alpha Centauri belong to multi-star systems. Direct imaging around binaries/multiple systems at a level of contrast allowing Earth-like planet detection is challenging because the region of interest is contaminated by the hosts star companion as well as the host Generally, the light leakage is caused by both diffraction and aberrations in the system. Moreover, the region of interest usually falls outside the correcting zone of the deformable mirror (DM) for the companion. Until now, it has been thought that removing the light of a companion star is too challenging, leading to the exclusion of binary systems from target lists of direct imaging coronographic missions. In this paper, we will show different new techniques for high-contrast imaging of planets around multi-star systems and detail the Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control (SNWC) method, which allows to control wavefront errors beyond nominal control region of the DM. Using the SNWC we reached contrasts around $ 5 \times 10 ^ { -9 } $ in a 10% bandwidth.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,Characterization of a silicon photomultiplier for the Ultra-Fast Astronomy telescope,"We characterized the S13360-3050CS Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC), a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.. Measurements were obtained inside a light tight dark box using 365 nm, 400 nm, 525 nm, 660 nm, 720 nm, 810 nm, and 900 nm light-emitting diodes (LED) and the Citiroc 1A front-end evaluation system manufactured by Weeroc. At a 2.95V over voltage, we measured a dark count rate of 5.07x$10^{5}$ counts per second at 26$^{\circ}$C, crosstalk probability of 8.7$\%$, photon detection efficiency of 36$\%$ at 400 nm, linear range of 1.8x$10^{7}$ photons per second, and saturation at 5x$10^8$ photons per second.

Persistent circular currents of exciton-polaritons in cylindrical pillar microcavities,"We have experimentally observed an eddy current of exciton polaritons arising in a cylindrical GaAs/AlGaAs pillar microcavity under the nonresonant optical pumping. The polariton current manifests itself in a Mach-Zehnder interferometry image as a characteristic spiral that occurs due to the interference of the light emitted by an exciton-polariton condensate with a spherical wave artificially shaped from the emission of the same condensate. We have experimentally observed the condensates with the topological charges m = +1, m = -1 and m = -2.

Here, we report the generation of unsubstituted indeno[1,2-a]fluorene, the final and yet unreported parent indenofluorene isomer, on various surfaces by cleavage of two C-H bonds in 7,12-dihydroindeno[1,2-a]fluorene through voltage pulses applied by the tip of a combined scanning tunneling microscope and atomic force microscope. On bilayer NaCl on Au(111), indeno[1,2-a]fluorene is in the neutral charge state, while it exhibits charge bistability between neutral and anionic states on the lower work function surfaces of bilayer NaCl on Ag(111) and Cu(111). In the neutral state, indeno[1,2-a]fluorene exhibits either of two ground states: an open-shell pi-diradical state, predicted to be a triplet by density functional and multireference many-body perturbation theory calculations, or a closed-shell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety in the as-indacene core.

Investigating signatures of cosmological time dilation in duration measures of prompt gamma-ray burst light curves,"We study the evolution with redshift of three measures of gamma-ray burst (GRB) duration ($T_{\rm 90}$, $T_{\rm 50}$ and $T_{\rm R45}$) in a fixed rest frame energy band for a sample of 232 Swift/BAT detected GRBs. Binning the data in redshift we demonstrate a trend of increasing duration with increasing redshift that can be modelled with a power-law for all three measures. Comparing redshift defined subsets of rest-frame duration reveals that the observed distributions of these durations are broadly consistent with cosmological time dilation. To ascertain if this is an instrumental effect, a similar analysis of Fermi/GBM data for the 57 bursts detected by both instruments is conducted, but inconclusive due to small number statistics. We then investigate under-populated regions of the duration redshift parameter space. We propose that the lack of low-redshift, long duration GRBs is a physical effect due to the sample being volume limited at such redshifts. However, we also find that the high-redshift, short duration region of parameter space suffers from censorship as any Swift GRB sample is fundamentally defined by trigger criteria determined in the observer frame energy band of Swift/BAT. As a result, we find that the significance of any evidence for cosmological time dilation in our sample of duration measures typically reduces to $<2\sigma$.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,The intrinsic line width of the Fe Ka line of AGN,"X-ray fluorescent lines are unique features of the reflection spectrum of the cold torus when irradiated by the central AGN. Their intrinsic line widths can be used to probe the line-emitting region. The line widths of the Fe \Ka line measured from the first order Chandra High Energy Grating (HEG) spectra are $3-5$ times larger than those measured with the Si \Ka line for Circinus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068. Because the observed Si \Ka and Fe \Ka lines are not necessarily coming from the same physical region, it is uncertain whether the line widths of the Fe \Ka line are over-estimated or not. We measured the intrinsic line widths of the Fe \Ka line of several nearby bright AGN using the second and third order Chandra HEG spectra, whose spectral resolutions are better than the first order data. We found the measured widths are all smaller than those from the first order data. The results clearly show that the widths of the Fe \Ka line measured from the first order HEG data are over-estimated. It indicates that the Fe \Ka lines of the studied sources are originating from regions around the cold dusty torus.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Emergence of a confined state in a weakly bent wire,"In this paper we use a simple straightforward technique to investigate the emergence of a bound state in a weakly bent wire.

One is electron whispering-gallery mode in graphene quantum dots arising from the Klein tunneling of the massless Dirac fermions. The other is atomic collapse state, which has never been observed in experiment with real atoms due to the difficulty of producing heavy nuclei with charge Z 170, however, can be realized near a Coulomb impurity in graphene with a charge Z 1 because of the small velocity of the Dirac excitations. Here, unexpectedly, we demonstrate that both the electron whispering-gallery modes and atomic collapse states coexist in grapheneWSe2 heterostructure quantum dots due to the Coulomb-like potential near their edges. By applying a perpendicular magnetic field, evolution from the atomic collapse states to unusual Landau levels in the collapse regime are explored for the first time.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Testing heavy neutral leptons produced in the supernovae explosions with future neutrino detectors,"Hypothetical particles called heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) can be produced in large quantities in the cores of supernovae during the first seconds of the explosion. These particles then decay, producing secondary energetic neutrinos that can be detected by neutrino detectors. In this paper, I identify a region of the HNL parameter space that could be tested using this method, assuming a supernova explosion at distances from 0.2 to 10 kpc. The range of HNLs masses $m_N \sim 160-700$ MeV and lifetimes of $\tau_N \gtrsim 0.02$ seconds can be probed using the Hyper-Kamiokande neutrino detector. This region of the parameter space is complementary to existing bounds from primordial nucleosynthesis and to the expected sensitivity of the future SHiP experiment, thus covering a gap in our current knowledge of HNLs up to masses of $m_N \simeq 400$ MeV.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Evidence of non-luminous matter in the center of M62,"Theoretical models suggest that intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) may form and reside in the centers of globular clusters. IMBHs are still elusive to observations, but the accelerations of pulsars may bring along a unique fingerprint of their presence. In this work, we focus on the pulsars in the globular cluster M62. Using the new distance of M62 obtained from Gaia observations, we find that the measured pulsars' accelerations suggest a central excess of mass in the range [1200, 6000]$M_{\odot}$, corresponding to [0.2, 1] percent of the current total mass of the cluster. Our analysis can not unambiguously discriminate between an IMBH or a system of stellar mass dark remnants of comparable total mass.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
A Unified Theory of Consequences of Spontaneous Emission in a $\Lambda$ System,"In a $\Lambda$ system with two nearly degenerate ground states and one excited state in an atom or quantum dot, spontaneous radiative decay can lead to a range of phenomena, including electron-photon entanglement, spontaneously generated coherence, and two-pathway decay. We show that a treatment of the radiative decay as a quantum evolution of a single physical system composed of a three-level electron subsystem and photons leads to a range of consequences depending on the electron-photon interaction and the measurement. Different treatments of the emitted photon channel the electron-photon system into a variety of final states. The theory is not restricted to the three-level system.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Symmetry-based requirement for the measurement of electrical and thermal Hall conductivity under an in-plane magnetic field,"The in-plane (thermal) Hall effect is an unconventional transverse response when the applied magnetic field is in the (heat) current plane. In contrast to the normal Hall effect, the in-plane Hall effect requires the absence of certain crystal symmetries, and possibly manifests a non-trivial topology of quantum materials. An accurate estimation of the intrinsic in-plane (thermal) Hall conductivity is crucial to identify the underlying mechanisms as in the case of the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate alpha-RuCl3. Here, we give the symmetry conditions for the in-plane Hall effect and discuss the implications that may impede the experimental evaluation of the in-plane (thermal) Hall conductivity within the single-device measurement. First, the lack of symmetry in crystals can create merohedral twin domains that cancel the total Hall signal. Second, even in a twin-free crystal, the intrinsic response is potentially contaminated by the out-of-plane conduction in three-dimensional systems, which is systematically unavoidable in the in-plane Hall systems. Third, even in a quasi-two-dimensional system, the conversion of (thermal) resistivity, rho (lambda), to (thermal) conductivity, sigma (kappa) requires protocols beyond the widely-used simplified formula due to the lack of in-plane-rotational symmetry. In principle, two independent sample devices are necessary to accurately estimate the s_xy (k_xy). As a case study, we discuss the half-integer quantization of the in-plane thermal Hall effect in the spin-disordered state of alpha-RuCl3. For an accurate measurement of the thermal Hall effect, it is necessary to avoid crystals with the merohedral twins contributing oppositely to k_xy, while the out-of-plane transport may have a negligible effect. To deal with the field-induced rotational-symmetry breaking, we propose two symmetry-based protocols, improved single-device and two-device methods.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Phase coherent transport in bilayer and trilayer MoS2,"Bilayer MoS2 is a centrosymmetric semiconductor with degenerate spin states in the six valleys at the corners of the Brillouin zone. It has been proposed that breaking of this inversion symmetry by an out-of-plane electric field breaks this degeneracy, allowing for spin and valley lifetimes to be manipulated electrically in bilayer MoS2 with an electric field. In this work, we report phase-coherent transport properties of double-gated mono-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS2. We observe a similar crossover from weak localization to weak anti-localization, from which we extract the spin relaxation time as a function of both electric field and temperature. We find that the spin relaxation time is inversely proportional to momentum relaxation time, indicating that D'yakonov-Perel mechanism is dominant in all devices despite its centrosymmetry. Further, we found no evidence of electric-field induced changes in spin-orbit coupling strength. This suggests that the interlayer coupling is sufficiently weak and that electron-doped dichalcogenide multilayers behave electrically as decoupled monolayers.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Dicke Superradiance in a magnetoplasma,"We present theoretical results for superradiance, i.e. the collective coherent decay of a radiating system, in a semiconductor heterostructure under a strong quantizing magnetic field.

This peak has a characteristic dependence on the magnetic field and should be observable on sub-picosecond time scales.

These measurements are based on the 2010 data sample, consisting of a total integrated luminosity of 37 inverse picobarns. Inclusive jet double-differential cross sections are presented as a function of jet transverse momentum, in bins of jet rapidity. Dijet double-differential cross sections are studied as a function of the dijet invariant mass, in bins of half the rapidity separation of the two leading jets. The measurements are performed in the jet rapidity range |y|<4.4, covering jet transverse momenta from 20 GeV to 1.5 TeV and dijet invariant masses from 70 GeV to 5 TeV. The data are compared to expectations based on next-to-leading order QCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative effects, as well as to next-to-leading order Monte Carlo predictions.

Higher winding number in a non-unitary photonic quantum walk,"Topological matter exhibits exotic properties yet phases characterized by large topological invariants are difficult to implement, despite rapid experimental progress. A promising route toward higher topological invariants is via engineered Floquet systems, particularly in photonics, where flexible control holds the potential of extending the study of conventional topological matter to novel regimes. Here we implement a one-dimensional photonic quantum walk to explore large winding numbers. By introducing partial measurements and hence loss into the system, we detect winding numbers of three and four in multi-step non-unitary quantum walks, which agree well with theoretical predictions. Moreover, by probing statistical moments of the walker, we identify locations of topological phase transitions in the system, and reveal the breaking of pseudo-unitary near topological phase boundaries. As the winding numbers are associated with non-unitary time evolution, our investigation enriches understanding of topological phenomena in non-unitary settings.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Relaxation of a Colloidal Particle into a Nonequilibrium Steady State,"We study the relaxation of a single colloidal sphere which is periodically driven between two nonequilibrium steady states.

Branching Fractions and CP Asymmetries of the Quasi-Two-Body Decays in $B_{s} \to K^0(\overline K^0)K^\pm \pi^\mp$ within PQCD Approach,"Motivated by the first untagged decay-time-integrated amplitude analysis of $B_s \to K_SK^{\mp}\pi^{\pm}$ decays performed by LHCb collaboration, where the decay amplitudes are modeled to contain the resonant contributions from intermediate resonances $K^*(892)$, $K_0^*(1430)$ and $K_2^*(1430)$, we comprehensively investigate the quasi-two-body $B_{s} \to K^0/\overline{\kern -0.2em K}^0 K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ decays, and calculate the branching fractions and the time-dependent $CP$ asymmetries within the perturbative QCD approach based on the $k_T$ factorization. In the quasi-two-body space region the calculated branching fractions with the considered intermediate resonances are in good agreement with the experimental results of LHCb by adopting proper $K\pi$ pair wave function, describing the interaction between the kaon and pion in the $K\pi$ pair. Furthermore,within the obtained branching fractions of the quasi-two-body decays, we also calculate the branching fractions of corresponding two-body decays, and the results consist with the LHCb measurements and the earlier studies with errors. For these considered decays, since the final states are not flavour-specific, the time-dependent $CP$ could be measured. We calculate six $CP$-violation observables, which can be tested in the ongoing LHCb experiment.",hep,hep-ph,Hadron-hadron total cross sections and soft high-energy scattering on the lattice,"The nonperturbative approach to soft high-energy hadron-hadron scattering, based on the analytic continuation of Euclidean Wilson-loop correlation functions, makes possible the investigation of the problem of the asymptotic energy dependence of hadron-hadron total cross sections by means of lattice calculations.

Superconductivity at 5 K in quasi-one-dimensional Cr-based KCr3As3 single crystals,"Recently a new family of Cr-based A2Cr3As3 (A = K, Rb, Cs) superconductors were reported, which own a rare quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) crystal structure with infinite (Cr3As3)2- chains and exhibit intriguing superconducting characteristics possibly derived from spin-triplet electron pairing. The crystal structure of A2Cr3As3 is actually a slight variation of the hexagonal TlFe3Te3 prototype although they have different lattice symmetry. Here we report superconductivity in a 133-type KCr3As3 compound that belongs to the latter structure. The single crystals of KCr3As3 were prepared by the deintercalation of K ions from K2Cr3As3 crystals which were grown from a high-temperature solution growth method, and it owns a centrosymmetric lattice in contrast to the non-centrosymmetric K2Cr3As3. After annealing at a moderate temperature, the KCr3As3 crystals show bulk superconductivity at 5 K revealed by electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements.

In this compound, Tc of samples with identical hole dopings is strongly affected by the Ca/Ba substitution x due to subtle variations in the lattice constants, while crystal symmetry and disorder as measured by line-widths are x independent. We examine two extreme values of x and two extreme values of hole-doping content y corresponding to antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. The x dependence of the spin mode energies is approximately the same for both the antiferromagnetic and superconducting samples. This clearly demonstrates that RIXS is sensitive to J even in doped samples. A positive correlation between the superexchange J and the maximum of Tc at optimal doping Tc^{max} is observed. We also measured the x dependence of the d_{xy} -> d_{x^2-y^2} and d_{xz/yz} -> d_{x^2-y^2} orbital splittings. We infer that the effect of the unresolved d_{3z^2-r^2} -> d_{x^2-y^2} excitation on Tc^{max} is much smaller than the effect of J. There appears to be dispersion in the d_{xy} -> d_{x^2-y^2} peak of up to 0.05 eV. Our fitting of the peaks furthermore indicates an asymmetric dispersion for the d_{xz/yz} -> d_{x^2-y^2} excitation.

The source of the neutrinos is assumed to be a neutrino-cooled accretion disk around the compact object. Under the assumption of the separability of the neutrino null geodesic equation of motion we obtain the general relativistic expression of the energy deposition rate for arbitrary stationary and axisymmetric space-times. The neutrino trajectories are obtained by using a ray tracing algorithm, based on numerically solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for neutrinos by reversing the proper time evolution. We obtain the energy deposition rates for several classes of rotating neutron stars, described by different equations of state of the neutron matter, and for quark stars, described by the MIT bag model equation of state and in the CFL (Color-Flavor-Locked) phase, respectively. The electron-positron energy deposition rate on the rotation axis of rotating neutron and quark stars is studied for two accretion disk models (isothermal disk and accretion disk in thermodynamical equilibrium). Rotation and general relativistic effects modify the total annihilation rate of the neutrino-antineutrino pairs on the rotation axis of compact stellar, as measured by an observer at infinity. The differences in the equations of state for neutron and quark matter also have important effects on the spatial distribution of the energy deposition rate by neutrino-antineutrino annihilation.",hep,hep-th,1
Vortex rings in fragmentation regions in heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 39 GeV,"Vorticity generated in heavy-ion collisions at energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 39 GeV is studied. Simulations are performed within a model of the three-fluid dynamics. A peculiar structure consisting of two vortex rings is found: one ring in the target fragmentation region and another one in the projectile fragmentation region. These rings are also formed in central collisions. The matter rotation is opposite in this two rings. These vortex rings are already formed at the early stage of the collision together with primordial fragmentation regions. The average vorticity, responsible for the global polarization of the observed $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$, is also studied. In the semi-central collisions the average vorticity in the midrapidity region turns out to be more than an order of magnitude lower than the total one. The total vorticity is dominated by the contributions of the fragmentation regions and is produced because of asymmetry of the vortex rings in noncentral collisions. This suggests that in semi-central collisions the global polarization in the fragmentation regions should be at least an order of magnitude higher than that observed by the STAR collaboration in the midrapidity. This polarization should be asymmetrical in the reaction plain and correlate with the corresponding directed flow.",hep,hep-ph,"Higgs Vacuum Stability, Neutrino Mass, and Dark Matter","Recent results from ATLAS and CMS point to a narrow range for the Higgs mass: $M_H\in[ 124, 126] {\rm GeV}$. Given this range, a case may be made for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) because of the resultant vacuum stability problem, i.e., the SM Higgs quartic coupling may run to negative values at a scale below the Planck scale. We study representative minimal extensions of the SM that can keep the SM Higgs vacuum stable to the Planck scale by introducing new scalar or fermion interactions at the TeV scale while solving other phenomenological problems. In particular, we consider the type-II seesaw model, which is introduced to explain the non-zero Majorana masses of the active neutrinos. Similarly, we observe that if the stability of the SM Higgs vacuum is ensured by the running of the gauge sector couplings, then one may require a series of new electroweak multiplets, the neutral component of which can be cold dark matter candidate. Stability may also point to a new U(1) gauge symmetry, in which the SM Higgs carries non-zero charge.",hep,hep-ph,1

We show that the distribution of sizes and concentrations for 1.90 < z < 2.35 galaxies selected via their rest-frame optical emission-lines are statistically indistinguishable from those of Lyman-alpha emitting systems found at z ~ 2.1 and z ~ 3.1. We also show that the z > 2 star-forming systems of all sizes and masses become smaller and more compact as one shifts the observing window from the UV to the optical.

A narrow Ly-alpha emission line with two peaks in four galaxies and with three peaks in one object is seen in medium-resolution COS spectra with a velocity separation between the peaks Vsep varying from ~153 km/s to ~345 km/s. We find a general increase of the LyC escape fraction with increasing O32 and decreasing stellar mass M*, but with a large scatter of fesc(LyC). A tight anti-correlation is found between fesc(LyC) and Vsep making Vsep a good parameter for the indirect determination of the LyC escape fraction.

Dynamical symmetry breaking in models with strong Yukawa interactions,"The primary aim of the thesis is to explore the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking by strong Yukawa dynamics. Technically, the symmetry is assumed to be broken by formation of symmetry-breaking parts of both the scalar and the fermion propagators, rather than by the scalar vacuum expectation values. The idea is first introduced on an example of a toy model with the underlying symmetry being an Abelian one and later applied to a realistic model of electroweak interaction. In addition, the thesis also deals with some more general, model-independent issues, applicable not only to the discussed model of strong Yukawa dynamics, but to a wider class of models with dynamical mass generation. First of these issues is the problem of fermion flavor mixing in the presence of fermion self-energies with a general momentum dependence. It is in particular shown how to define the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in such models and argued that it can come out in principle non-unitary. Second issue is the problem of calculating the gauge boson masses when the symmetry is broken by fermion self-energies. On top of deriving the formula for the gauge boson mass matrix we also find corrections to the related Pagels-Stokar formula.",hep,hep-ph,Heavy Quarkonium Production at Collider Energies: Factorization and Evolution,"We present a factorization formalism for inclusive production of heavy quarkonia of large transverse momentum, $p_T$ at collider energies, including both leading power (LP) and next-to-leading power (NLP) behavior in $p_T$. We demonstrate that both LP and NLP contributions can be factorized in terms of perturbatively calculable short-distance partonic coefficient functions and universal non-perturbative fragmentation functions, and derive the evolution equations that are implied by the factorization. We identify projection operators for all channels of the factorized LP and NLP infrared safe short-distance partonic hard parts, and corresponding operator definitions of fragmentation functions. For the NLP, we focus on the contributions involving the production of a heavy quark pair, a necessary condition for producing a heavy quarkonium. We evaluate the first non-trivial order of evolution kernels for all relevant fragmentation functions, and discuss the role of NLP contributions.",hep,hep-ph,1
"Reply to Comment on ""Reevaluation of the parton distribution of strange quarks in the nucleon""","A Comment on the recently published reevaluation of the polarization-averaged parton distribution of strange quarks in the nucleon using final data on the multiplicities of charged kaons in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering is reviewed. Important features of the comparison of one-dimensional projections of the multidimensional HERMES data are pointed out. A test of the leading-order extraction of xS(x) using the difference between charged-kaon multiplicities is repeated. The results are consistent with leading-order predictions within the uncertainties in the input data, and do not invalidate the earlier extraction of xS(x).",hep,hep-ph,A non-vanishing neutrino mass and the strong CP problem: A new solution from the perspective of the EW-$\nu_R$ model,"The EW-$\nu_R$ model was constructed to provide a scenario in which right-handed neutrinos are non-sterile and have masses proportional to the electroweak scale, providing an opportunity to test the seesaw mechanism at the LHC. What was hidden in the model until recently is the chiral symmetry which helps solve the strong CP problem by using it to rotate $\theta_{QCD}$ to zero. It turns out the contribution from the electroweak sector to the effective $\bar{\theta}$ is proportional to the light neutrino masses and is naturally small, satisfying the constraint coming from the present absence of the neutron electric dipole moment, and without the need for an axion.

Effective Theory of Non-Adiabatic Quantum Evolution Based on the Quantum Geometric Tensor,"We study the role of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) in the evolution of quantum systems. We show that all its components play an important role on the extra phase acquired by a spinor and on the trajectory of an accelerated wavepacket in any realistic finite-duration experiment. While the adiabatic phase is determined by the Berry curvature (the imaginary part of the tensor), the non-adiabaticity is determined by the quantum metric (the real part of the tensor) and allows to determine corrections in the regimes where Landau-Zener approach is inapplicable. The particular case of a planar microcavity in the strong coupling regime allows to extract the QGT components by direct light polarization measurements and to check their effects on the quantum evolution.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Controllable quantum spin precession by Aharonov-Casher phase in conducting ring,"We investigate quantum spin transport in a structure of conducting ring, embedded in textured electric field, with two leads, and obtain an exact solution for the problem. The spin precession induced by the Aharonov-Casher phase is studied. It is shown that the spin-polarized current and its polarizability can be controlled by the electric field. As a result the polarizability is a function of the geometric phase which originates from the spin-orbital interaction in the ring. 72.25.-b, 03.65.Vf",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Video Observation of Geminid 2010 from India using a portable system,"Visual observations of meteor showers have been carried out for many decades by astronomers. Modern developments in imaging systems have advanced our knowledge about the shower dynamics and their origin. We have made an attempt to make a portable video recording system to observe meteor showers. The system consists of a camera capable of recording the rapid motion of meteors entering the Earths atmosphere. The camera is interfaced with a laptop using an open source software like VirtualDub. The initial testing was carried out while observing Geminid meteor shower in December, 2010 from the base of Mahuli fort (Lat: $19.47{\deg}$ N, Long: $73.26{\deg}$ E) near Asangaon, India. Here, we present few of the meteors recorded during this event, followed by a preliminary analysis of the shower. The portable video recording system enables to capture meteors at a remote location. This system will strengthen traditional visual observation methods used by astronomers in India. Future coordinated studies with a multi-station approach using such systems will assist in deriving the parameters associated with meteor shower activity and its impact on the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, we propose long term and simultaneous multi-station video observations in the Indian subcontinent for continuous monitoring and better understanding of meteor dynamics.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,FISH: A 3D parallel MHD code for astrophysical applications,"FISH is a fast and simple ideal magneto-hydrodynamics code that scales to ~10 000 processes for a Cartesian computational domain of ~1000^3 cells. The simplicity of FISH has been achieved by the rigorous application of the operator splitting technique, while second order accuracy is maintained by the symmetric ordering of the operators. Between directional sweeps, the three-dimensional data is rotated in memory so that the sweep is always performed in a cache-efficient way along the direction of contiguous memory. Hence, the code only requires a one-dimensional description of the conservation equations to be solved. This approach also enable an elegant novel parallelisation of the code that is based on persistent communications with MPI for cubic domain decomposition on machines with distributed memory. This scheme is then combined with an additional OpenMP parallelisation of different sweeps that can take advantage of clusters of shared memory. We document the detailed implementation of a second order TVD advection scheme based on flux reconstruction. The magnetic fields are evolved by a constrained transport scheme. We show that the subtraction of a simple estimate of the hydrostatic gradient from the total gradients can significantly reduce the dissipation of the advection scheme in simulations of gravitationally bound hydrostatic objects. Through its simplicity and efficiency, FISH is as well-suited for hydrodynamics classes as for large-scale astrophysical simulations on high-performance computer clusters. In preparation for the release of a public version, we demonstrate the performance of FISH in a suite of astrophysically orientated test cases.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,1
Constraining the top-light initial mass function in the extended ultraviolet disk of M83,"The universality or non-universality of the initial mass function (IMF) has significant implications for determining star formation rates and star formation histories from photometric properties of stellar populations. We reexamine whether the IMF is deficient in high-mass stars (top-light) in the low-density environment of the outer disk of M83 and constrain the shape of the IMF therein. Using archival Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV) data and new deep OmegaCAM narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging, we constructed a catalog of FUV-selected objects in the outer disk of M83. We counted H$\alpha$-bright clusters and clusters that are blue in FUV$-$NUV in the catalog, measured the maximum flux ratio $F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$ among the clusters, and measured the total flux ratio $\Sigma F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/\Sigma f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$ over the catalog. We then compared these measurements to predictions from stellar population synthesis models made with a standard Salpeter IMF, truncated IMFs, and steep IMFs. We also investigated the effect of varying the assumed internal extinction on our results. We are not able to reproduce our observations with models using the standard Salpeter IMF or the truncated IMFs. It is only when assuming an average internal extinction of $0.10 < A_{\mathrm{V}} < 0.15$ in the outer disk stellar clusters that models with steep IMFs ($\alpha > 3.1$) simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster counts, the maximum observed $F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$, and the observed $\Sigma F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/\Sigma f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$. Our results support a non-universal IMF that is deficient in high-mass stars in low-density environments.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Nebular H$\alpha$ Limits for Fast Declining Type Ia Supernovae,"One clear observational prediction of the single degenerate progenitor scenario as the origin of type Ia supernovae (SNe) is the presence of relatively narrow ($\approx$1000 km s$^{-1}$) H$\alpha$ emission at nebular phases, although this feature is rarely seen. We present a compilation of nebular phase H$\alpha$ limits for SN Ia in the literature and demonstrate that this heterogenous sample has been biased towards SN Ia with relatively high luminosities and slow decline rates, as parameterized by $\Delta$m$_{15}(B)$, the difference in $B$-band magnitude between maximum light and fifteen days afterward. Motivated by the need to explore the full parameter space of SN~Ia and their subtypes, we present two new and six previously published nebular spectra of SN Ia with $\Delta$m$_{15}(B)$$ > $1.3 mag (including members of the transitional and SN1991bg-like subclasses) and measure nondetection limits of $L_{H\alpha}$$~<~$0.85--9.9$\times$10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, which we confirmed by implanting simulated H$\alpha$ emission into our data. Based on the lastest models of swept-up material stripped from a nondegenerate companion star, these $L_{H\alpha}$ values correspond to hydrogen mass limits of $M_H$$~\lesssim~$1-3$\times$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$, roughly three orders of magnitude below that expected for the systems modeled, although we note that no simulations of H$\alpha$ nebular emission in such weak explosions have yet been performed. Despite the recent detection of strong H$\alpha$ in ASASSN-18tb (SN 2018fhw; $\Delta$m$_{15}(B)$ = 2.0 mag), we see no evidence that fast declining systems are more likely to have late time H$\alpha$ emission, although a larger sample is needed to confirm this result.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
On the integrability of a lattice equation with two continuum limits,"We study a new example of lattice equation being one of the key equations of a recent generalized symmetry classification of five-point differential-difference equations.

Photometric and Spectroscopic analysis of four contact binaries,"We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of four W UMa binaries J015829.5+260333 (hereinafter as J0158), J030505.1+293443 (hereinafter as J0305), J102211.7+310022 (hereinafter as J1022) and KW Psc. The VRcIc band photometric observations are carried out with the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope. For low resolution spectroscopy, we used 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope as well as the archival data from 4-m LAMOST survey. The systems J0158 and J0305 show a period increase rate of 5.26(+/-1.72)x10^-7 days/yr and 1.78(+/-1.52)x10^-6 days/yr, respectively. The period of J1022 is found to be decreasing with a rate of 4.22(+/-1.67)x10^-6 days/yr. The period analysis of KW Psc displays no change in its period. PHOEBE package is used for the light curve modeling and basic parameters are evaluated with the help of GAIA parallax. The asymmetry of light curves is explained with the assumption of cool spots at specific positions on one of the components of the system. On the basis of temperatures, mass ratios, fill-out factors and periods, the system J1022 is identified as W-subtype systems while the others show some mixed properties. To probe the chromospheric activities in these W UMa binaries, their spectra are compared with the known inactive stars spectra. The comparison shows emission in H\alpha, H\beta and CaII. To understand the evolutionary status of these systems, the components are drawn in mass-radius and mass-luminosity planes with other well characterized binary systems. The secondary components of all the systems are away from ZAMS which indicates that secondary is more evolved than the primary component.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Asymmetric Distribution of the Solar Photospheric Magnetic Field Values,"Understanding the characteristics of the solar magnetic field is essential for interpreting solar activities and dynamo. In this research, we investigated the asymmetric distribution of the solar photospheric magnetic field values, using synoptic charts constructed from space-borne high-resolution magnetograms. It is demonstrated that the Lorentzian function describes the distribution of magnetic field values in the synoptic charts much better than the Gaussian function, and this should reflect the gradual decay process from strong to weak magnetic fields. The asymmetry values are calculated under several circumstances, and the results generally show two periodicities related to the variation of the solar B$_0$ angle and the solar cycle, respectively. We argue that it is the small-scale magnetic fields, the inclination of the solar axis, the emergence and evolution of magnetic flux, and the polar fields that are responsible for the features of asymmetry values. We further determined the polar field reversal time of solar cycles 23 and 24 with the flip of asymmetry values. Specifically, for cycle 24, we assert that the polar polarities of both hemispheres reversed at the same time - in March 2014; as to cycle 23, the reversal time of the S-hemisphere is March 2001, while the determination of the N-hemisphere is hampered by missing data.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
The singularity problem and phase-space noncanonical noncommutativity,"The Wheeler-DeWitt equation arising from a Kantowski-Sachs model is considered for a Schwarzschild black hole under the assumption that the scale factors and the associated momenta satisfy a noncanonical noncommutative extension of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. An integral of motion is used to factorize the wave function into an oscillatory part and a function of a configuration space variable. The latter is shown to be normalizable using asymptotic arguments. It is then shown that on the hypersufaces of constant value of the argument of the wave function's oscillatory piece, the probability vanishes in the vicinity of the black hole singularity.",hep,hep-ph,Electroweak symmetry breaking in the inverse seesaw mechanism,"We investigate the stability of Higgs potential in inverse seesaw models. We derive the full two-loop RGEs of the relevant parameters, such as the quartic Higgs self-coupling, taking thresholds into account. We find that for relatively large Yukawa couplings the Higgs quartic self-coupling goes negative well below the Standard Model instability scale $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. We show, however, that the ``dynamical'' inverse seesaw with spontaneous lepton number violation can lead to a completely consistent and stable Higgs vacuum up to the Planck scale.",hep,hep-ph,1
Results from Long-Term Optical Monitoring of the Soft X-Ray Transient SAX J1810.8-2609,"In this paper we report the long-term optical observation of the faint soft X-ray transient SAX J1810.8-2609 from OGLE and MOA. We have focused on the 2007 outburst, and also did the cross-correlate between its optical light curves and the quasi-simultaneous X-ray observations from swift. Both the optical and X-ray light curves of 2007 outburst show multi-peak features. Quasi-simultaneous optical/X-ray luminosity shows that both the X-ray reprocessing and viscously thermal emission can explain the observed optical flux. There is a slightly X-ray delay of 0.6+-0.3 days during the first peak, while the X-ray emission lags the optical emission by ~2 days during the rebrightening stage, which suggests that X-ray reprocessing emission contributes significantly to the optical flux in the first peak, but the viscously-heated-disk origin dominates the optical flux during rebrightening. It implies variation of the physical environment of the outer disk, even the source stayed in low-hard state during the whole outburst. The ~2 day X-ray lag indicates a small accretion disk of the system, and the optical counterpart was not detected by OGLE and MOA during quiescence, which constrained it to be fainter than MI = 7.5 mag. There is a suspected short-time optical flare detected at MJD = 52583.5 without X-ray counterpart detected, this single flux increase may imply a magnetic loop reconnection in the outer disk as proposed by Zurita et al (2003). The observations cover all stages of the outburst, however, due to the low sensitivity of RXTE/ASM, we cannot conclude whether it is an optical precursor at the initial rise of the outburst.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Numerical Relativity Simulations of Precessing Binary Neutron Star Mergers,"We present the first set of numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron mergers that include spin precession effects and are evolved with multiple resolutions. Our simulations employ consistent initial data in general relativity with different spin configurations and dimensionless spin magnitudes $\sim 0.1$. They start at a gravitational-wave frequency of $\sim392$~Hz and cover more than $1$ precession period and about 15 orbits up to merger. We discuss the spin precession dynamics by analyzing coordinate trajectories, quasi-local spin measurements, and energetics, by comparing spin aligned, antialigned, and irrotational configurations. Gravitational waveforms from different spin configuration are compared by calculating the mismatch between pairs of waveforms in the late inspiral. We find that precession effects are not distinguishable from nonprecessing configurations with aligned spins for approximately face-on binaries, while the latter are distinguishable from a nonspinning configurations. Spin precession effects are instead clearly visible for approximately edge-on binaries. For the parameters considered here, precession does not significantly affect the characteristic postmerger gravitational-wave frequencies nor the mass ejection. Our results pave the way for the modeling of spin precession effects in the gravitational waveform from binary neutron star events.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Universal behavior of QCD amplitudes at high energy from general tools of statistical physics,"We show that high energy scattering is a statistical process essentially similar to reaction-diffusion in a system made of a finite number of particles. The Balitsky-JIMWLK equations correspond to the time evolution law for the particle density. The squared strong coupling constant plays the role of the minimum particle density. Discreteness is related to the finite number of partons one may observe in a given event and has a sizeable effect on physical observables. Using general tools developed recently in statistical physics, we derive the universal terms in the rapidity dependence of the saturation scale and the scaling form of the amplitude, which come as the leading terms in a large rapidity and small coupling expansion.",hep,hep-ph,Improved analysis of black hole formation in high-energy particle collisions,"We investigate formation of an apparent horizon (AH) in high-energy particle collisions in four- and higher-dimensional general relativity, motivated by TeV-scale gravity scenarios. The goal is to estimate the prefactor in the geometric cross section formula for the black hole production. We numerically construct AHs on the future light cone of the collision plane. Since this slice lies to the future of the slice used previously by Eardley and Giddings (gr-qc/0201034) and by one of us and Nambu (gr-qc/0209003), we are able to improve the prefactor estimates. The black hole production cross section increases by 40-70% in the higher-dimensional cases, indicating larger black hole production rates in future-planned accelerators than previously estimated. We also determine the mass and the angular momentum of the final black hole state, as allowed by the area theorem.",hep,hep-ph,1
Parity violation in stochastic gravitational wave background from inflation,"We study the inflationary implications of a novel parity-violating gravity model, which modifies the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity by introducing the Nieh-Yan term coupled to an axion-like field. The parity-violating Nieh-Yan term results in the velocity birefringence of gravitational waves (GWs) and triggers the tachyonic instability only for one of the two circular polarization states. We consider that the inflaton is identified as the coupled axion-like field with a wiggly potential characterized by steep cliffs connected by smooth plateaus. During inflation, the temporary fast roll of axion on the cliff-like region leads to the significant enhancement of the tensor perturbations in one polarization state with the wave numbers that exit the horizon around this period. In this setup, the resulting energy spectrum for GWs presents a sizable localized bump involving the contribution of only one polarization state. This chiral GW background is detectable by LISA and Taiji, and its chirality can be determined by correlating two detectors, which provide an opportunity to probe the inflation and test the gravity model.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,"hi_class: Background Evolution, Initial Conditions and Approximation Schemes","Cosmological datasets have great potential to elucidate the nature of dark energy and test gravity on the largest scales available to observation. Theoretical predictions can be computed with hi_class (www.hiclass-code.net), an accurate, fast and flexible code for linear cosmology, incorporating a wide range of dark energy theories and modifications to general relativity. We introduce three new functionalities into hi_class: (1) Support for models based on covariant Lagrangians, including a constraint-preserving integration scheme for the background evolution and a series of worked-out examples: Galileon, nKGB, quintessence (monomial, tracker) and Brans-Dicke. (2) Consistent initial conditions for the scalar-field perturbations in the deep radiation era, identifying the conditions under which modified-gravity isocurvature perturbations may grow faster than adiabatic modes leading to a loss of predictivity. (3) An automated quasistatic approximation scheme allowing order-of-magnitude improvement in computing performance without sacrificing accuracy for wide classes of models. These enhancements bring the treatment of dark energy and modified gravity models to the level of detail comparable to software tools restricted to standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies.

Optimal Prediction of Time-to-Failure from Information Revealed by Damage,"We present a general prediction scheme of failure times based on updating continuously with time the probability for failure of the global system, conditioned on the information revealed on the pre-existing idiosyncratic realization of the system by the damage that has occurred until the present time. Its implementation on a simple prototype system of interacting elements with unknown random lifetimes undergoing irreversible damage until a global rupture occurs shows that the most probable predicted failure time (mode) may evolve non-monotonically with time as information is incorporated in the prediction scheme. In addition, both the mode, its standard deviation and, in fact, the full distribution of predicted failure times exhibit sensitive dependence on the realization of the system, similarly to ``chaos'' in spinglasses, providing a multi-dimensional dynamical explanation for the broad distribution of failure times observed in many empirical situations.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Determination of the local concentrations of Mn interstitials and antisite defects in GaMnAs,We present a method for the determination of the local concentrations of interstitial and substitutional Mn atoms and As antisite defects in GaMnAs.

Optimal Condition for Strong Terahertz Radiation from Intrinsic Josephson Junctions,"In order to enhance the radiation power in terahertz band based on the intrinsic Josephson junctions of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ single crystal, we investigate a long cylindrical sample embedded in a dielectric material. Tuning the dielectric constant, the radiation power has a maximum which is achieved when it equals the dissipation caused by Josephson plasma. This yields the optimal dielectric constant of wrapping material in terms of the properties of BSCCO single crystal. The maximal radiation power is found proportional to the product of the typical superconducting current squared and the typical normal resistance, or the gap energy squared divided by the typical normal resistance, which offers a guideline for choosing superconductor as a source of strong radiation. By introducing an anti-reflection layer, we can build a compact device with the BSCCO cylinder and two wrapping dielectric layers with finite thicknesses.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,Polaron Crystallization and Melting: Effects of the Long-Range Coulomb Forces,"On examining the stability of a Wigner crystal in an ionic dielectric, two competitive effects due to the polaron formation are found to be important: (i) the screening of the Coulomb force, which destabilizes the crystal, compensated by (ii) the increase of the carrier mass (polaron mass). The competition between the two effects is carefully studied, and the quantum melting of the polaronic Wigner crystal is examined by varying the density at zero temperature. By calculating the quantum fluctuations of both the electron and the polarization, we show that there is a competition between the dissociation of the polarons at the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT), and a melting towards a polaron liquid. We find that at strong coupling, a liquid state of dielectric polarons cannot exist, and the IMT is driven by the polaron dissociation. Next, taking into account the dipolar interactions between localized carriers, we show that these are responsible for an instability of the transverse vibrational modes of the polaronic Wigner crystal as the density increases. This provides a new mechanism for the IMT in doped dielectrics, which yields interesting dielectric properties below and beyond the transition. An optical signature of such a mechanism for the IMT is provided.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,1

Subsequently we identify the perturbative enhancement mechanism due to the penguin contractions of the current-current operators from the weak effective Hamiltonian, which yields the significant impacts on the CP violating observables.",hep,hep-ex,1
Low rank Green's function representations applied to dynamical mean-field theory,"Several recent works have introduced highly compact representations of single-particle Green's functions in the imaginary time and Matsubara frequency domains, as well as efficient interpolation grids used to recover the representations. In particular, the intermediate representation with sparse sampling and the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) make use of low-rank compression techniques to obtain optimal approximations with controllable accuracy. We consider the use of the DLR in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations, and in particular, show that the standard full Matsubara frequency grid can be replaced by the compact grid of DLR Matsubara frequency nodes. We test the performance of the method for a DMFT calculation of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ at temperature $50$K using a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and demonstrate that Matsubara frequency quantities can be represented on a grid of only $36$ nodes with no reduction in accuracy, or increase in the number of self-consistent iterations, despite the presence of significant Monte Carlo noise.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,First principles investigation of cubic RbGeO3 novel inorganic lead-free germanate perovskite material for optoelectronic and plasmonic applications,"In this work, theoretical investigation of cubic Pm-3m phase RbGeO3 germanate perovskite using plain wave basis, density function theory (DFT) is conducted. DFT modelling calculations, clearly shows that this perovskite exhibits thermodynamic and dynamical stability in the cubic phase, identical to that of high pressure perovskite cubic SrGeO3. As from the computed phonon dispersions this system also exhibits anti-ferro distortive (AFD) instabilities, much similar as that observed in case of cubic SrGeO3 at ground state conditions. Hence, from this study we conclude that ideal cubic perovskite phase of RbGeO3 can be synthesized under identical experimental conditions, as that reported for SrGeO3 in the literature. Further, we report the fundamental opto-electronic properties of this material system from first principles DFT calculations, which are not yet reported and as per calculated properties this perovskite material is found to be well suited for opto-electronic and plasmonics based applications.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Light neutrino propagation in matter without heavy neutrino decoupling,"We review the propagation of light neutrinos in matter assuming that their mixing with heavy neutrinos is close to present experimental limits. The phenomenological implications of the non-unitarity of the light neutrino mixing matrix for neutrino oscillations are discussed. In particular we show that the resonance effect in neutrino propagation in matter persists, but for slightly modified values of the parameters and with the maximum reduced by a small amount proportional to the mixing between light and heavy neutrinos squared.",hep,hep-ph,On the radiative decays of light vector and axial-vector mesons,"We study the light vector and axial-vector mesons. According to the hadrogenesis conjecture the nature of the two types of states is distinct. The axial-vector mesons are generated dynamically by coupled-channel interactions based on the chiral Lagrangian written down in terms of the Goldstone bosons and the light vector mesons. We propose a novel counting scheme that arises if the chiral Lagrangian is supplemented by constraints from large-N_c QCD in the context of the hadrogenesis conjecture. The counting scheme is successfully tested by a systematic study of the properties of vector mesons. The spectrum of light axial-vector mesons is derived relying on the leading order interaction of the Goldstone bosons with the vector mesons supplemented by a phenomenology for correction terms. The f_1(1282), b_1(1230), h_1(1386), a_1(1230) and K_1(1272) mesons are recovered as molecular states. Based on those results the one-loop contributions to the electromagnetic decay amplitudes of axial-vector molecules into pseudo-scalar or vector mesons are evaluated systematically. In order to arrive at gauge invariant results in a transparent manner we choose to represent the vector particles by anti-symmetric tensor fields. It is emphasized that there are no tree-level contributions to a radiative decay amplitude of a given state if that state is generated by coupled-channel dynamics. The inclusion of the latter would be double counting. At present we restrict ourselves to loops where a vector and a pseudo-scalar meson couple to the axial-vector molecule. We argue that final and predictive results require further computations involving intermediate states with two vector mesons. The relevance of the latter is predicted by our counting rules.",hep,hep-ph,1
Aspects of Brane Physics in 5 and 6 Dimensions,"We outline a general strategy to deal with perturbations in brane world models.

Secular Orbital Dynamics of the Possibly Habitable Planet K2-18 b with and without the Proposed Inner Companion,"The transiting planet K2-18 b is one of the best candidates for a relatively nearby world harboring biological life. The long-term orbital evolution of this planet is investigated using theoretical and purely numerical techniques for two possible configurations: a single planet orbiting the host star, and a two-planet system including the proposed inner planet close to the 4:1 mean motion rationalization. The emphasis is made on the secular changes of eccentricity and orbital inclination, which are important for the climate stability of the planet. It is demonstrated that the secular orbital dynamics of planet K2-18 b with an internal companion are accurately represented by the periodic eccentricity and inclination exchange on the time scales of a few Kyr. A single planet is not expected to experience fast orbital changes, with the much weaker tidal and rotation-driven perturbations mostly reflecting in a slow periastron and nodal precession. The tidal decay of the orbit is too insignificant on the time scale of the stellar age. However, the conditions for the habitability of a single K2-18 b planet are much improved if, like the Earth, it rotates faster than the mean motion and its rotation angle is tilted by a hypothetical moon.

Using CanariCam at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias, we detected linear polarization at 8.7, 10.3, and 12.5 $\mu$m from discs around eight Herbig Ae/Be stars and one T-Tauri star. We analyzed polarimetric properties of each object to find out the most likely interpretation of the data. While the observed mid-infrared polarization from most objects is consistent with polarized emission and/or absorption arising from aligned dust particles, we cannot rule out polarization due to dust scattering for a few objects in our sample. For those objects for which polarization can be explained by polarized emission and/or absorption, we examined how the derived magnetic field structure correlates with the disc position angle and inclination. We found no preference for a certain type of magnetic field. Instead, various configurations (toroidal, poloidal, or complex) are inferred from the observations. The detection rate (64 per cent) of polarized mid-infrared emission and/or absorption supports the expectation that magnetic fields and suitable conditions for grain alignment are common in protoplanetary discs around Herbig Ae/Be stars.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,1
Productivity of Solar Flares and Magnetic Helicity Injection in Active Regions,"The main objective of this study is to better understand how magnetic helicity injection in an active region is related to the occurrence and intensity of solar flares. We therefore investigate magnetic helicity injection rate and unsigned magnetic flux, as a reference. In total, 378 active regions are analyzed using $SOHO$/MDI magnetograms. The 24-hour averaged helicity injection rate and unsigned magnetic flux are compared with the flare index and the flare-productive probability in next 24 hours following an measurement. In addition, we study the variation of helicity over a span of several days around the times of the 19 flares above M5.0 which occurred in selected strong flare-productive active regions. The major findings of this study are: (1) for a sub-sample of 91 large active regions with unsigned magnetic fluxes in the range from 3 to 5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ Mx, there is a difference in magnetic helicity injection rate between flaring active regions and non-flaring active regions by a factor of 2; (2) the $GOES$ C-flare-productive probability as a function of helicity injection displays a sharp boundary between flare-productive active regions and flare-quiet ones; (3) the history of helicity injection before all the 19 major flares displayed a common characteristic: a significant helicity accumulation of (3-45)$ \times$ 10 $^{42}$ Mx$^2$ during a phase of monotonically increasing helicity over 0.5 to 2 days. Our results support the notion that helicity injection is important in flares, but it is not effective to use it alone for the purpose of flare forecast. It is necessary to find a way to better characterize the time history of helicity injection as well as its spatial distribution inside active regions.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Near-Sun and 1 AU magnetic field of coronal mass ejections: A parametric study,"Aims. The magnetic field of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) determines their structure, evolution, and energetics, as well as their geoeffectiveness. However, we currently lack routine diagnostics of the near-Sun CME magnetic field, which is crucial for determining the subsequent evolution of CMEs. Methods. We recently presented a method to infer the near-Sun magnetic field magnitude of CMEs and then extrapolate it to 1 AU. This method uses relatively easy to deduce observational estimates of the magnetic helicity in CME-source regions along with geometrical CME fits enabled by coronagraph observations. We hereby perform a parametric study of this method aiming to assess its robustness. We use statistics of active region (AR) helicities and CME geometrical parameters to determine a matrix of plausible near-Sun CME magnetic field magnitudes. In addition, we extrapolate this matrix to 1 AU and determine the anticipated range of CME magnetic fields at 1 AU representing the radial falloff of the magnetic field in the CME out to interplanetary (IP) space by a power law with index aB. Results. The resulting distribution of the near-Sun (at 10 Rs ) CME magnetic fields varies in the range [0.004, 0.02] G, comparable to, or higher than, a few existing observational inferences of the magnetic field in the quiescent corona at the same distance. We also find that a theoretically and observationally motivated range exists around aB = -1.6 +-0.2, thereby leading to a ballpark agreement between our estimates and observationally inferred field magnitudes of magnetic clouds (MCs) at L1. Conclusions. In a statistical sense, our method provides results that are consistent with observations.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Target Mass Corrections for Polarized Structure Functions and New Sum Rules,The target mass corrections are calculated for all structure functions of neutral and charged current deep inelastic scattering in lowest order in the coupling constant. Representations of the correction to the twist--2 and twist--3 contributions are derived both in Mellin-$n$ and $x$-space. The impact of the target mass corrections on the general relations between the twist--2 and twist--3 parts of the structure functions is studied and three new relations between the twist--3 contributions are derived.,hep,hep-ex,The FASER Detector,"FASER, the ForwArd Search ExpeRiment, is an experiment dedicated to searching for light, extremely weakly-interacting particles at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Such particles may be produced in the very forward direction of the LHC's high-energy collisions and then decay to visible particles inside the FASER detector, which is placed 480 m downstream of the ATLAS interaction point, aligned with the beam collisions axis. FASER also includes a sub-detector, FASER$\nu$, designed to detect neutrinos produced in the LHC collisions and to study their properties.

Theoretical priors in scalar-tensor cosmologies: Thawing quintessence,"The late time acceleration of the Universe can be characterized in terms of an extra, time dependent, component of the universe -- dark energy. The simplest proposal for dark energy is a scalar-tensor theory -- quintessence -- which consists of a scalar field, $\phi$, whose dynamics is solely dictated by its potential, $V(\phi)$. Such a theory can be uniquely characterized by the equation of state of the scalar field energy momentum-tensor. We find the time dependence of the equation of state for a broad family of potentials and, using this information, we propose an analytic prior distribution for the most commonly used parametrization. We show that this analytic prior can be used to accurately predict the distribution of observables for the next generation of cosmological surveys. Including the theoretical priors in the comparison with observations considerably improves the constraints on the equation of state.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Hot WHIM counterparts of FUV OVI absorbers: Evidence in the line-of-sight towards quasar 3C 273,"We explore the high spectral resolution X-ray data towards the quasar 3C273 to search for signals of hot ($\sim10^{6-7}$ K) X-ray-absorbing gas co-located with two established intergalactic FUV OVI absorbers. We analyze the soft X-ray band grating data of all XMM-Newton and Chandra instruments to search for the hot phase absorption lines at the FUV predicted redshifts. The viability of potential line detections is examined by adopting the constraints of a physically justified absorption model. The WHIM hypothesis is investigated with a complementary 3D galaxy distribution analysis, and by comparison of the measurement results to the WHIM properties in the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation. At FUV redshift z=0.09017, we measured signals of two hot ion species, OVIII and NeIX, with a $3.9\sigma$ combined significance level. Considering the line features in all instruments collectively and assuming collisional equilibrium for absorbing gas, we were able to constrain the temperature ($kT=0.26\pm0.03$ keV) and the column density ($N_H\times{Z_\odot/Z}=1.3_{-0.5}^{+0.6}\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$) of the absorber. Thermal analysis indicates that FUV and X-ray absorption relate to different phases, with estimated temperatures $T_{FUV}\approx3\times10^5$ and $T_{X-ray}\approx3\times10^6$ K, which match the EAGLE predictions for WHIM at the FUV/X-ray measured $N_{ion}$-ranges. We detected a large scale galactic filament crossing the sightline at the redshift of the absorption, linking the absorption to this structure. This study provides insights into co-existing warm and hot gas within a WHIM filament and estimates the ratio of the hot and warm phases. Because the hot phase is thermally distinct from the OVI gas, the estimated baryon content of the absorber is increased, conveying the promise of X-ray follow-up studies of FUV detected WHIM in refining the picture of the missing baryons.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Holographic energy loss in non-relativistic backgrounds,"In this paper, we study some aspects of energy loss in non-relativistic theories from holography. We analyze the energy lost by a rotating heavy point particle along a circle of radius $l$ with angular velocity $\omega$ in theories with general dynamical exponent $z$ and hyperscaling violation exponent $\theta$. It is shown that this problem provides a novel perspective on the energy loss in such theories. A general computation at zero and finite temperature is done and it is shown that how the total energy loss rate depends non-trivially on two characteristic exponents $(z,\theta)$. We find that at zero temperature there is a special radius $l_c$ where the energy loss is independent of different values of $(\theta,z)$. Also at zero temperature, there is a crossover between a regime in which the energy loss is dominated by the linear drag force and by the radiation because of the acceleration of the rotating particle. We find that the energy loss of the particle decreases by increasing $\theta$ and $z$. We note that, unlike in the zero temperature, there is no special radius $l_c$ at finite temperature case.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Charge-Ordered State versus Dimer-Mott Insulator at Finite Temperatures,"We theoretically investigate the competition between charge-ordered state and Mott insulating state at finite temperatures in quarter-filled quasi-one-dimensional electron systems, by studying dimerized extended Hubbard chains with interchain Coulomb interactions. In order to take into account one-dimensional fluctuations properly, we apply the bosonization method to an effective model obtained by the interchain mean-field approximation. The results show that lattice dimerization, especially in the critical region, and frustration in the interchain Coulomb interactions reduce the charge-ordering phase transition temperature and enlarge the dimer-Mott insulating phase. We also derive a general formula of the Knight shift in the charge-ordered phase and its implication to experiments is discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Dynamical TAP approach to mean field glassy systems,"The Thouless, Anderson, Palmer (TAP) approach to thermodynamics of mean field spin-glasses is generalised to dynamics. A method to compute the dynamical TAP equations is developed and applied to the p-spin spherical model. In this context we show to what extent the dynamics can be represented as an evolution in the free energy landscape. In particular the relationship between the long-time dynamics and the local properties of the free energy landscape shows up explicitly within this approach. Conversely, by an instantaneous normal modes analysis we show that the local properties of the energy landscape seen by the system during its dynamical evolution do not change qualitatively at the dynamical transition.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Anomalous Heat Diffusion,"Consider anomalous energy spread in solid phases, i.e., $MSD= \int (x -{< x >}_E)^2 \rho_E(x,t)dx \propto t^{\beta}$, as induced by a small initial excess energy perturbation distribution $\rho_{E}(x,t=0)$ away from equilibrium. The associated total thermal equilibrium heat flux autocorrelation function $C_{JJ}(t)$ is shown to obey rigorously the intriguing relation, $d^2 MSD/dt^2 = 2C_{JJ}(t)/(k_BT^2c)$, where $c$ is the specific volumetric heat capacity. Its integral assumes a time-local Helfand-moment relation; i.e. $ dMSD/dt|_{t=t_s} = 2/(k_BT^2c)\int_0^{t_s} C_{JJ}(s)ds$, where the chosen cut-off time $t_s$ is determined by the maximal signal velocity for heat transfer. Given the premise that the averaged nonequilibrium heat flux is governed by an anomalous heat conductivity, energy diffusion scaling necessarily determines a corresponding anomalous thermal conductivity scaling behavior.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
Multi-Graviton Theories in the Causal Approach,The system of multi-gravitons has been considered before in the framework of functional formalism. We consider here the system of multi-gravitons in the causal formalism of quantum field theory. We derive in this formalism the fact that distinct gravitons cannot interact. The proof is based on a careful analysis of the first two orders of the perturbation theory.,hep,hep-th,Relativistic Collective Coordinate System of Solitons and Spinning Skyrmion,"We consider constructing the relativistic system of collective coordinates of a field theory soliton on the basis of a simple principle: The collective coordinates must be introduced into the static solution in such a way that the equation of motion of the collective coordinates ensures that of the original field theory. As an illustration, we apply this principle to the quantization of spinning motion of the Skyrmion by incorporating the leading relativistic correction to the rigid body approximation. We calculate the decay constant and various static properties of nucleons, and find that the relativistic corrections are in the range of 5% -- 20%. We also examine how the baryons deform due to the spinning motion.",hep,hep-th,1
Nuclear parton distribution functions and their effects on sin^2 theta_W anomaly,Nuclear parton distribution functions (NPDFs) are investigated by analyzing the data on structure functions F_2^A and Drell-Yan cross sections sigma_{DY}^{pA}. An important point of this analysis is to show uncertainties of the NPDFs by the Hessian method. The analysis indicates that the uncertainties are large for antiquark distributions at x>0.2 and gluon distributions in the whole x region. We also discuss a nuclear effect on the NuTeV sin^2 theta_W anomaly as an application.,hep,hep-ph,Higgs Bosons in a minimal R-parity conserving left-right supersymmetric model,"We revisit the Higgs sector of the left-right supersymmetric model. We study the scalar potential in a version of the model in which the minimum is the charge conserving vacuum state, without R-parity violation or additional non-renormalizable terms in the Lagrangian. We analyze the dependence of the potential and of the Higgs mass spectrum on the various parameters of the model, pinpointing the most sensitive ones. We also show that, contrary to previous expectations, the model can predict light neutral flavor-conserving Higgs bosons, while the flavor-violating ones are heavy, and within the limits from K0-K0bar, D0-D0bar and B0-B0bar mixings. We study variants of the model in which at least one pair of doubly-charged Higgs bosons is light, and show that the parameter space for such Higgs masses and mixings is very restrictive, thus making the model more predictive.",hep,hep-ph,1
Heavy-Quark spin symmetry breaking in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation,"Heavy-quark spin symmetry is explicitly broken by the mass splitting between a heavy-light pseudoscalar meson and its vector partner. This fact plays a pivotal role in the physics of states whose mass lies close to the threshold of an open-flavor meson pair, like $X(3872)$. We show that this source of heavy-quark spin symmetry breaking can be systematically included within the diabatic representation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We verify that including all the appropriate coupled channels guarantees conservation of total angular momentum, parity, and charge-conjugation parity. This marks a fundamental step towards a unified, first-principles study of quarkonia and meson molecules with hidden flavor.",hep,hep-ph,Transplanckian Censorship and Global Cosmic Strings,"Large field excursions are required in a number of axion models of inflation. These models also possess global cosmic strings, around which the axion follows a path mirroring the inflationary trajectory. Cosmic strings are thus an interesting theoretical laboratory for the study of transplanckian field excursions. We describe connections between various effective field theory models of axion monodromy and study the classical spacetimes around their supercritical cosmic strings. For small decay constants $f<M_p$ and large winding numbers $n>M_p/f$, the EFT is under control and the string cores undergo topological inflation, which may be either of exponential or power-law type. We show that the exterior spacetime is nonsingular and equivalent to a decompactifying cigar geometry, with the radion rolling in a potential generated by axion flux. Signals are able to circumnavigate infinite straight strings in finite but exponentially long time, $t\sim e^{\Delta a/M_p}$. For finite loops of supercritical string in asymptotically flat space, we argue that if topological inflation occurs, then topological censorship implies transplanckian censorship, or that external observers are forbidden from threading the loop and observing the full excursion of the axion.",hep,hep-ph,1
Hybrid simulations of lateral diffusion in fluctuating membranes,"In this paper we introduce a novel method to simulate lateral diffusion of inclusions in a fluctuating membrane. The regarded systems are governed by two dynamic processes: the height fluctuations of the membrane and the diffusion of the inclusion along the membrane. While membrane fluctuations can be expressed in terms of a dynamic equation which follows from the Helfrich Hamiltonian, the dynamics of the diffusing particle is described by a Langevin or Smoluchowski equation. In the latter equations, the curvature of the surface needs to be accounted for, which makes particle diffusion a function of membrane fluctuations. In our scheme these coupled dynamic equations, the membrane equation and the Langevin equation for the particle, are numerically integrated to simulate diffusion in a membrane. The simulations are used to study the ratio of the diffusion coefficient projected on a flat plane and the intramembrane diffusion coefficient for the case of free diffusion. We compare our results with recent analytical results that employ a preaveraging approximation and analyze the validity of this approximation. A detailed simulation study of the relevant correlation functions reveals a surprisingly large range where the approximation is applicable.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Threading-Induced Dynamical Transition in Tadpole-Shaped Polymers,"The relationship between polymer topology and bulk rheology remains a key question in soft matter physics. Architecture-specific constraints (or threadings) are thought to control the dynamics of ring polymers in ring-linear blends, which thus affects the viscosity to range between that of the pure rings and a value larger, but still comparable to, that of the pure linear melt. Here we consider qualitatively different systems of linear and ring polymers, fused together in ""chimeric"" architectures. The simplest example of this family is a ""tadpole""-shaped polymer - a single ring fused to the end of a single linear chain. We show that polymers with this architecture display a threading-induced dynamical transition that substantially slows chain relaxation. Our findings shed light on how threadings control dynamics and may inform design principles for chimeric polymers with topologically-tunable bulk rheological properties.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
"The Pressure in 2, 2+1 and 3 Flavour QCD","We calculate the pressure in QCD with two and three light quarks on a lattice of size 16^3x4 using tree level improved gauge and fermion actions. We argue that for temperatures T > 2T_c systematic effects due to the finite lattice cut-off and non-vanishing quark masses are below 15% in this calculation and give an estimate for the continuum extrapolated pressure in QCD with massless quarks. We find that the flavour dependence of the pressure is dominated by that of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Furthermore we perform a calculation of the pressure using 2 light (m_u,d/T=0.4) and one heavier quark (m_s/T = 1). In this case the pressure is reduced relative to that of three flavour QCD. This effect is stronger than expected from the mass dependence of an ideal Fermi gas.",hep,hep-ph,Neutrino Masses and Leptonic CP Violation,"Neutrino oscillations as solutions of the solar neutrino problems and the atmospheric neutrino deficits may restrict neutrino mass squared differences and mixing angles in three-neutrino mixing scheme. Currently we have several solutions depending on the interpretations of the solar neutrino problems. Combining the neutrino oscillation solutions and a mass matrix ansatz, we investigated the neutrino mass bounds and found possible leptonic CP-violating rephasing-invariant quantity $J^{l}_{\tiny CP} \leq 0.012$ for large mixing angle MSW and just-so vacuum oscillations solutions, and $J^{l}_{\tiny CP} \leq 0.0013$ for small mixing angle MSW solution.",hep,hep-ph,1
A classification of 3+1D bosonic topological orders (I): the case when point-like excitations are all bosons,"Topological orders are new phases of matter beyond Landau symmetry breaking. They correspond to patterns of long-range entanglement. In recent years, it was shown that in 1+1D bosonic systems there is no nontrivial topological order, while in 2+1D bosonic systems the topological orders are classified by a pair: a modular tensor category and a chiral central charge. In this paper, we propose a partial classification of topological orders for 3+1D bosonic systems: If all the point-like excitations are bosons, then such topological orders are classified by unitary pointed fusion 2-categories, which are one-to-one labeled by a finite group $G$ and its group 4-cocycle $\omega_4 \in \mathcal H^4[G;U(1)]$ up to group automorphisms. Furthermore, all such 3+1D topological orders can be realized by Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Strong angular dependent transmission ratio due to interplay between spin waves and the domain wall in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy materials,Spin waves (SW) can induce rich domain wall (DW) motion in a perpendicular-magnetic anisotropy nanostrip. In-plane magnetization tilt angle resulting from the fluctuation of the effective field of the magnetization response in the DW region plays an essential role in the dynamics of SW interacting with a DW. We performed simulation and found that the transmission ratio of the propagating SW across the DW depends strongly on the tilt angle in the low-frequency regime. The material parameters and the geometrical configuration can be fine-tuned for practical devices.,cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
ALMA imaging of the CO snowline of the HD 163296 disk with DCO+,"The high spatial and line sensitivity of ALMA opens the possibility of resolving emission from molecules in circumstellar disks. With an understanding of physical conditions under which molecules have high abundance, they can be used as direct tracers of distinct physical regions. In particular, DCO+ is expected to have an enhanced abundance within a few Kelvin of the CO freezeout temperature of 19 K, making it a useful probe of the cold disk midplane. We compare ALMA line observations of HD 163296 to a grid of models. We vary the upper- and lower-limit temperatures of the region in which DCO+ is present as well as the abundance of DCO+ in order to fit channel maps of the DCO+ J=5-4 line. To determine the abundance enhancement compared to the general interstellar medium, we carry out similar fitting to HCO+ J=4-3 and H13CO+ J=4-3 observations. ALMA images show centrally peaked extended emission from HCO+ and H13CO+. DCO+ emission lies in a resolved ring from ~110 to 160 AU. The outer radius approximately corresponds to the size of the CO snowline as measured by previous lower resolution observations of CO lines in this disk. The ALMA DCO+ data now resolve and image the CO snowline directly. In the best fitting models, HCO+ exists in a region extending from the 19 K isotherm to the photodissociation layer with an abundance of 3x10^-10 relative to H2. DCO+ exists within the 19-21 K region of the disk with an abundance ratio [DCO+] / [HCO+] = 0.3. This represents a factor of 10^4 enhancement of the DCO+ abundance within this narrow region of the HD 163296 disk. Such a high enhancement has only previously been seen in prestellar cores. The inferred abundances provide a lower limit to the ionization fraction in the midplane of the cold outer disk (approximately greater than 4x10^-10), and suggest the utility of DCO+ as a tracer of its parent molecule H2D+.

We explore various aspects of deuterium enrichment by constructing a chemical evolution model in gas and grain phases. Depending on various physical parameters, gas and grains are allowed to interact with each other through exchange of their chemical species. It is known that HCO+ and N2H+ are two abundant gas phase ions in ISM and their deuterium fractionation are generally used to predict degree of ionization in various regions of a molecular cloud. To have a more realistic estimation, we consider a density profile of a collapsing cloud. We present radial distributions of important interstellar molecules along with their deuterated isotopomers. We carry out quantum chemical simulation to study effects of isotopic substitution on spectral properties of these important interstellar species. We calculate vibrational (harmonic) frequency of the most important deuterated species (neutral & ions). Rotational and distortional constants of these molecules are also computed to predict rotational transitions of these species. We compare vibrational (harmonic) and rotational transitions as computed by us with existing observational, experimental and theoretical results.

"Neutrino Mass: Where Do We Stand, and Where Are We Going?","We discuss the three major hints of neutrino mass: the strong evidence of mass from the behavior of atmospheric neutrinos, the very promising further hint from the behavior of solar neutrinos, and the so-far unconfirmed hint from the LSND experiment. Then, we describe two illustrative neutrino-mass scenarios suggested by the observed hints. We identify the needed future tests of both the present hints and the neutrino-mass scenarios.",hep,hep-ph,A SUSY GUT of Flavour with S4 x SU(5) to NLO,"We construct a Supersymmetric (SUSY) Grand Unified Theory (GUT) of Flavour based on S4 x SU(5), together with an additional (global or local) Abelian symmetry, and study it to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. The model includes a successful description of quark and lepton masses and mixing angles at leading order (LO) incorporating the Gatto-Sartori-Tonin (GST) relation and the Georgi-Jarlskog (GJ) relations. We study the vacuum alignment arising from F-terms to NLO and such corrections are shown to have a negligible effect on the results for fermion masses and mixings achieved at LO. Tri-bimaximal (TB) mixing in the neutrino sector is predicted very accurately up to NLO corrections of order 0.1%. Including charged lepton mixing corrections implies small deviations from TB mixing described by a precise sum rule, accurately maximal atmospheric mixing and a reactor mixing angle close to three degrees.",hep,hep-ph,1
Kinetic Equations for Diffusion in the Presence of Entropic Barriers,"We use the mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics theory to derive the general kinetic equation of a system in the presence of potential barriers. The result is applied to the description of the evolution of systems whose dynamics is influenced by entropic barriers. We analyze in detail the case of diffusion in a domain of irregular geometry in which the presence of the boundaries induces an entropy barrier when approaching the exact dynamics by a coarsening of the description. The corresponding kinetic equation, named Fick-Jacobs equation, is obtained, and its validity is generalized through the formulation of a scaling law for the diffusion coefficient which depends on the shape of the boundaries. The method we propose can be useful to analyze the dynamics of systems at the nanoscale where the presence of entropy barriers is a common feature.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Equation of state of compressed matter: A simple statistical model,"We propose a simple approach for studying systems of compressed matter based on the Thomas-Fermi statistical model of single atom.

To implement this, a dielectric resonator loaded to a reflection mode operated microstrip line circuit is proposed. For the proposed reflection mode sensor, the sensor features like resonant frequency, impedance matching position, sensitivity, and dynamic range are sensitive to the displacement of DR to microstrip line. The impact of the substrate shape and size, and resonators geometrical properties are numerically analyzed and experimentally validated by using VNA.

Why the overlap formula does not lead to chiral fermions,"We describe a conceptually simple, but important test for the overlap approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories. We explain the equivalence of the overlap formula with a certain waveguide model for a simple set of gauge configurations (the trivial orbit). This equivalence is helpful in carrying out the test, and casts serious doubts on the viability of the overlap approach. A recent note by Narayanan and Neuberger which points out a mistake in our previous work is irrelevant in this context.",hep,hep-th,Scaling limit of the one-dimensional attractive Hubbard model: The non-half-filled band case,"The scaling limit of the less than half filled attractive Hubbard chain is studied. This is a continuum limit in which the particle number per lattice site, n, is kept finite (0<n<1) while adjusting the interaction and bandwidth in a such way that there is a finite mass gap. We construct this limit both for the spectrum and the secular equations describing the excitations. We find, that similarly to the half filled case, the limiting model has a massive and a massless sector. The structure of the massive sector is closely analogous to that of the half filled band and consequently to the chiral invariant SU(2) Gross-Neveu (CGN) model. The structure of the massless sector differs from that of the half filled band case: the excitations are of particle and hole type, however they are not uniquely defined. The energy and the momentum of this sector exhibits a tower structure corresponding to a conformal field theory with c=1 and SU(2)xSU(2) symmetry. The energy-momentum spectrum and the zero temperature free energy of the states with finite density coincides with that of the half filled case supporting the identification of the limiting model with the SU(2) symmetric CGN theory.",hep,hep-th,1
Disorder versus two transport lifetimes in a strongly correlated electron liquid,"We report on angle-dependent measurements of the sheet resistances and Hall coefficients of electron liquids in SmTiO3/SrTiO3/SmTiO3 quantum well structures, which were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on (001) DyScO3. We compare their transport properties with those of similar structures grown on LSAT [(La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O3]. On DyScO3, planar defects normal to the quantum wells lead to a strong in-plane anisotropy in the transport properties. This allows for quantifying the role of defects in transport. In particular, we investigate differences in the longitudinal and Hall scattering rates, which is a non-Fermi liquid phenomenon known as lifetime separation. The residuals in both the longitudinal resistance and Hall angle were found to depend on the relative orientations of the transport direction to the planar defects. The Hall angle exhibited a robust T2 temperature dependence along all directions, whereas no simple power law could describe the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistances. Remarkably, the degree of the carrier lifetime separation, as manifested in the distinctly different temperature dependences and diverging residuals near a critical quantum well thickness, was completely insensitive to disorder. The results allow for a clear distinction between disorder-induced contributions to the transport and intrinsic, non-Fermi liquid phenomena, which includes the lifetime separation.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Current-induced spin torque resonance of a magnetic insulator,"Pure spin currents transport angular momentum without an associated charge flow. This unique property makes them attractive for spintronics applications, such as torque induced magnetization control in nanodevices that can be used for sensing, data storage, interconnects and logics. Up to now, however, most spin transfer torque studies focused on metallic ferromagnets, while magnetic insulators were largely ignored, in spite of superior magnetic quality factors. Here, we report the observation of spin torque-induced magnetization dynamics in a magnetic insulator. Our experiments show that in ultrathin magnetic insulators the spin torque induced magnetization dynamics can be substantially larger than those generated by the Oersted field. This opens new perspectives for the efficient integration of ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnetic insulators into electronic devices.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Barrierless Electronic Relaxation in Solution: An analytically solvable model with arbitrary coupling,"In our recent publication, we have proposed an analytical method for solving the problem of electronic relaxation in solution, modeled by a particle undergoing diffusive motion under the influence of two arbitrary potentials and the coupling between the two potentials was assumed to be localized at one point. In this paper we have extended our work to deal with the case of delocalized coupling between two potentials. The average and long term rate constant for delocalized coupling is presented.",physics,physics.chem-ph,"Ion loss events in a cold Rb-Ca$^+$ hybrid trap: photodissociation, black-body radiation and non-radiative charge exchange","We theoretically investigate the collisional dynamics of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb ground-state atoms and $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ground-state ions in the context of the hybrid trap experiment of Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 243202 (2011)], leading to ion losses. Cold $^{87}$Rb$^{40}$Ca$^+$ ground-state molecular ions are created by radiative association, and we demonstrate that they are protected against photodissociation by black-body radiation and by the $^{40}$Ca$^+$ cooling laser at 397~nm. This study yields an interpretation of the direct observation of $^{87}$Rb$^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions in the experiment, in contrast to other hybrid trap experiments using other species. Based on novel molecular data for the spin-orbit interaction, we also confirm that the non-radiative charge-exchange is the dominant loss process for Ca$^+$ and obtain rates in agreement with experimental observations and a previous calculation.",physics,physics.chem-ph,1
Fluid ferroelectric filaments,"Freestanding slender fluid filaments of room temperature ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals are described. They are stabilized either by internal electric fields of bound charges formed due to polarization splay, or by external voltage applied between suspending wires. The phenomenon is similar to those observed in dielectric fluids, such as deionized water, except that in ferroelectric nematic materials the voltages required are 3 orders of magnitudes smaller and the aspect ratio is much higher. The observed ferroelectric fluid threads are not only unique and novel, but also offer measurements of basic physical quantities, such as the ferroelectric polarization and viscosity. Ferroelectric nematic fluid threads may have practical applications in nano-fluidic micron-size logic devices, switches, and relays.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Comparison of splashing in high and low viscosity liquids,"We explore the evolution of a splash when a liquid drop impacts a smooth, dry surface. There are two splashing regimes that occur when the liquid viscosity is varied, as is evidenced by its dependence on ambient gas pressure. A high-viscosity drop splashes by emitting a thin sheet of liquid from a spreading liquid lamella long after the drop has first contacted the solid. Likewise, we find that there is also a delay in the ejection of a thin sheet when a low-viscosity drop splashes. We show how the ejection time of the thin sheet depends on liquid viscosity and ambient gas pressure.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Mapping the Diversity of Galaxy Spectra with Deep Unsupervised Machine Learning,"Modern spectroscopic surveys of galaxies such as MaNGA consist of millions of diverse spectra covering different regions of thousands of galaxies. We propose and implement a deep unsupervised machine learning method to summarize the entire diversity of MaNGA spectra onto a 15x15 map (DESOM-1), where neighbouring points on the map represent similar spectra. We demonstrate our method as an alternative to conventional full spectral fitting for deriving physical quantities, as well as their full probability distributions, much more efficiently than traditional resource-intensive Bayesian methods. Since spectra are grouped by similarity, the distribution of spectra onto the map for a single galaxy, i.e., its ""fingerprint"", reveals the presence of distinct stellar populations within the galaxy indicating smoother or episodic star-formation histories. We further map the diversity of galaxy fingerprints onto a second map (DESOM-2). Using galaxy images and independent measures of galaxy morphology, we confirm that galaxies with similar fingerprints have similar morphologies and inclination angles. Since morphological information was not used in the mapping algorithm, relating galaxy morphology to the star-formation histories encoded in the fingerprints is one example of how the DESOM maps can be used to make scientific inferences.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,The 300 pc resolution imaging of a z = 8.31 galaxy: Turbulent ionized gas and potential stellar feedback 600 million years after the Big Bang,"We present the results of 300 pc resolution ALMA imaging of the [OIII] 88 $\mu$m line and dust continuum emission from a $z = 8.312$ Lyman break galaxy MACS0416_Y1. The velocity-integrated [OIII] emission has three peaks which are likely associated with three young stellar clumps of MACS0416_Y1, while the channel map shows a complicated velocity structure with little indication of a global velocity gradient unlike what was found in [CII] 158 $\mu$m at a larger scale, suggesting random bulk motion of ionized gas clouds inside the galaxy. In contrast, dust emission appears as two individual clumps apparently separating or bridging the [OIII]/stellar clumps. The cross correlation coefficient between dust and ultraviolet-related emission (i.e., [OIII] and ultraviolet continuum) is unity on a galactic scale, while it drops at < 1 kpc, suggesting well mixed geometry of multi-phase interstellar media on sub-kpc scales. If the cutoff scale characterizes different stages of star formation, the cutoff scale can be explained by gravitational instability of turbulent gas. We also report on a kpc-scale off-center cavity embedded in the dust continuum image. This could be a superbubble producing galactic-scale outflows, since the energy injection from the 4 Myr starburst suggested by a spectral energy distribution analysis is large enough to push the surrounding media creating a kpc-scale cavity.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Implicit infinite lattice summations for real space ab initio correlation methods,"We suggest a local wave function based ab initio correlation method for infinite periodic systems, which can describe both the near range as well as the long range correlation effects coherently in the same scheme. Specifically, this work introduces a formalism which allows to describe the long range polarization cloud around a quasi particle in a solid explicitly in the formalism of local wave function based ab initio descriptions. To this end we reformulate the infinite lattice summation underlying the quantum chemistry formula to second order in a closed analytic form employing the elliptic theta function of the third kind. All formulas and manipulations are developed explicitely in full detail and a first numeric example demonstrates the principle idea. Good results for the long range polarization effects in LiH and LiF are found in agreement with earlier estimates.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Towards efficient orbital-dependent density functionals for weak and strong correlation,"We present a new paradigm for the design of exchange-correlation functionals in density-functional theory. Electron pairs are correlated explicitly by means of the recently developed second order Bethe-Goldstone equation (BGE2) approach. Here we propose a screened BGE2 (sBGE2) variant that efficiently regulates the coupling of a given electron pair. sBGE2 correctly dissociates H$_2$ and H$_2^+$, a problem that has been regarded as a great challenge in density-functional theory for a long time. The sBGE2 functional is then taken as a building block for an orbital-dependent functional, termed ZRPS, which is a natural extension of the PBE0 hybrid functional. While worsening the good performance of sBGE2 in H$_2$ and H$_2^{+}$, ZRPS yields a remarkable and consistent improvement over other density functionals across various chemical environments from weak to strong correlation.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
The influence of anisotropy on the evolution of interfacial morphologies in directional solidification: A phase-field study,"By adjusting the interface energy, curvature, and velocity, the anisotropy plays an important role in the interaction between interfacial processes and transport processes, determining the solidification structures. In this paper, through the quantitative phase-field model, the influence of anisotropy on the evolution of interfacial morphologies in directional solidification is investigated. To represent different interfacial anisotropies, the solidification processes with different preferred crystallographic orientations are performed. Then the effect of anisotropy on morphological evolution is discussed systematically. At the planar growth stage, the interfacial anisotropy makes no difference in the transport processes and morphological evolution. At the onset time of planar instability, the anisotropy determines the detailed evolution by adjusting the interface stiffness. At the planar-cellular-transition stage, with the influence of anisotropy, the interfacial curvature decreases from {\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}. Hence, the solute concentration ahead of the interface increases from {\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}, while the instantaneous velocity of the interface decreases from {\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}. At the quasi-steady-state stage, the anisotropy determines the growth direction and tip velocity of the primary dendrite, as well as the onset of sidebranches.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Breaking rate minimum predicts the collapse point of over-loaded materials,"As a model of composite materials, we choose a bundle of fibers with stochastically distributed breaking thresholds for the individual fibers. the fibers are assumed to share the load equally and to obey Hookean elasticity right up to the breaking point. We study the evolution of the fiber breaking rate at a constant load in excess of the critical load. The analysis shows that the breaking rate reaches a minimum when the system is half-way from its complete collapse.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Single-quasiparticle stability and quasiparticle-pair decay in YBa2Cu3O6.5 (Ortho II),"We report results and analysis of time-resolved photoinduced reflectivity experiments on the cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O6.5. The sample, which has Tc=45 K, was characterized by a high degree of purity and Ortho II ordering. The change in reflectivity (Delta R) was induced and probed using pulses of 100 femtosecond duration and photon energy 1.55 eV from a Ti:Sapphire laser. We provide a detailed picture of the decay rate (gamma) of Delta R as a function of temperature T and pump intensity I. At low T, gamma decreases linearly with decreasing I, extrapolating to nearly zero in the limit that I tends to zero. At higher temperatures gamma has the same linear dependence, but with nonzero limit as I goes to zero. In the interpretation of these results we assume that Delta R is proportional to the nonequilibrium quasiparticle density created by the laser. From an analysis of the gamma vs. I we estimate beta, the coefficient of proportionality relating the quasiparticle decay rate to the density. The intercept of gamma vs. I yields the thermal equilibrium quasiparticle decay rate. In a discussion section, we argue that the quasiparticles induced by the laser occupy primarily states near the antinodal regions of the Brillouin zone. We explain the divergence of the lifetime as T and I both tend to zero as a consequence of momentum and energy conservation in electron-electron scattering. We discuss the significance of the measured value of beta (approximately 0.1 cm2/s) in terms of the electron-phonon interactions.",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,Spin-polarized local density of states in the vortex state of helical p-wave superconductors,"Properties of the vortex state in helical p-wave superconductor are studied by the quasi-classical Eilenberger theory. We confirm the instability of the helical p-wave state at high fields and that the spin-polarized local density of states M(E,r) appears even when Knight shift does not change. This is because the vorticity couples to the chirality of up-spin pair or down-spin pair of the helical state. In order to identify the helical p-wave state at low fields, we investigate the structure of the zero-energy M (E = 0, r) in the vortex states, and also the energy spectra of M (E, r).",cond-mat,cond-mat.supr-con,1
Measurement of Two-Qubit States by a Two-Island Single Electron Transistor,"We solve the master equations of two charged qubits measured by a single-electron transistor (SET) consisted of two islands.

A transfer matrix method for the analysis of fractal quantum potentials,The scattering properties of quantum particles on fractal potentials at different stages of fractal growth are obtained by means of the transfer matrix method. This approach can be easily adopted for project assignments in introductory quantum mechanics for undergraduates. The reflection coefficients for both the fractal potential and the finite periodic potential are calculated and compared. It is shown that the reflection coefficient for the fractal has a self-similar structure associated with the fractal distribution of the potential.,physics,physics.ed-ph,The group administered interactive questionnaire: An alternative to individual interviews,"Individual interviews are often considered to be the gold standard for researchers to understand how people think about phenomena. However, conducting and analyzing interviews is very time consuming.

Use of GAIQ will be discussed in the context of a study that seeks to understand teaching assistants' reasons for the design of problem solutions for introductory physics.",physics,physics.ed-ph,1
Collapsing Sub-Critical Bubbles,"In the standard scenario, the electroweak phase transition is a first order phase transition which completes by the nucleation of critical bubbles. Recently, there has been speculation that the standard picture of the electroweak phase transition is incorrect. Instead, it has been proposed that throughout the phase transition appreciable amounts of both broken and unbroken phases of $SU(2)$ coexist in equilibrium. I argue that this can not be the case. General principles insure that the universe will remain in a homogenous state of unbroken $SU(2)$ until the onset of critical bubble production.",hep,hep-ph,Angular Scaling in Jets,"We introduce a jet shape observable defined for an ensemble of jets in terms of two-particle angular correlations and a resolution parameter R. This quantity is infrared and collinear safe and can be interpreted as a scaling exponent for the angular distribution of mass inside the jet. For small R it is close to the value 2 as a consequence of the approximately scale invariant QCD dynamics. For large R it is sensitive to non-perturbative effects. We describe the use of this correlation function for tests of QCD, for studying underlying event and pile-up effects, and for tuning Monte Carlo event generators.",hep,hep-ph,1
Penguin corrections and strong phases in a time-dependent analysis of $B^0_{d} \to \pi^+ \pi^-$,"From a time-dependent analysis of the decay $B^0_{d} \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ and using a model-dependent $A_P/A_T$ ratio of the penguin-to-tree amplitudes contributing to the decay, both the weak phase $\alpha$ and the strong phase shift difference $\delta$ can be extracted from the data. The value of the weak phase $\beta$, expected to be measured from the decay $B^0_{d} \to J/\psi K_S$, is used to parameterize the value of $A_P/A_T$ and the corresponding penguin correction to the observed asymmetry in $B^0_{d} \to \pi^+ \pi^-$.",hep,hep-ph,Distinguishing cusp effects and near-threshold-pole effects,"We make use of a unitarized coupled-channel model to analyze the mass distribution data of final states in production processes of $X(4260)$. By analyzing the analytical structures of the decay amplitudes, we find that the line shape of $Z_c(3900)$ signal is related to the combined effect of a pair of near-threshold ""shadow"" poles and the $(D\bar{D}^*)^\pm$ thresholds, in which the third-sheet pole might provide a dominant contribution. As all the coupled channels effects are tuning off, the trajectories of these two poles suggest that the $Z_c(3900)$ might originate from the attractive interaction of $(D^*\bar{D}^*)^\pm$ through a long-distance interaction, $e.g.$ $\pi$-exchange interaction, as a ""deuteron-like"" state. There is no nearby pole structure corresponding to the $Z_c(4025)$ signal in the $(D^*\bar{D}^*)^\pm$ mass distribution.",hep,hep-ph,1
A Physical Interpretation of MOND,"Earlier comparisons of galatic rotation curves with MOND have arrived at the conclusion that the parameter a_0 lies within ~20% of cH_0/2\pi, where c is the velocity of light and H_0 is the Hubble constant.

Part 1. Magnetic Resonance of Internally Trapping Water Anions: A Density Functional Theory Study,"Density functional theory (DFT) is used to rationalize magnetic parameters of hydrated electron trapped in alkaline glasses as observed using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies. To this end, model water cluster anions (n=4-8 and n=20,24) that localize the electron internally are examined. It is shown that EPR parameters of such water anions (such as hyperfine coupling tensors of H/D nuclei in the water molecules) are defined mainly by the cavity size and the coordination number of the electron; the water molecules in the second solvation shell play a relatively minor role. An idealized model of hydrated electron (that is usually attributed to L. Kevan) in which six hydroxyl groups arranged in an octahedral pattern point towards the common center is shown to provide the closest match to the experimental parameters, such as isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants for the protons (estimated from ESEEM), the second moment of the EPR spectra, and the radius of gyration. The salient feature of these DFT models is the significant transfer (10-20%) of spin density into the frontal O 2p orbitals of water molecules. Spin bond polarization involving these oxygen orbitals accounts for small, negative hyperfine coupling constants for protons in hydroxyl groups that form the electron-trapping cavity. In Part 2, these results are generalized for more realistic geometries of core anions obtained using a dynamic one-electron mixed qunatum/classical molecular dynamics model.",physics,physics.gen-ph,1
Adiabatic waveforms for extreme mass-ratio inspirals via multivoice decomposition in time and frequency,"We compute adiabatic waveforms for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) by ""stitching"" together a long inspiral waveform from a sequence of waveform snapshots, each of which corresponds to a particular geodesic orbit. We show that the complicated total waveform can be regarded as a sum of ""voices."" Each voice evolves in a simple way on long timescales, a property which can be exploited to efficiently produce waveform models that faithfully encode the properties of EMRI systems. We look at examples for a range of different orbital geometries: spherical orbits, equatorial eccentric orbits, and one example of generic (inclined and eccentric) orbits. To our knowledge, this is the first calculation of a generic EMRI waveform that uses strong-field radiation reaction. We examine waveforms in both the time and frequency domains. Although EMRIs evolve slowly enough that the stationary phase approximation (SPA) to the Fourier transform is valid, the SPA calculation must be done to higher order for some voices, since their instantaneous frequency can change from chirping forward ($\dot f > 0$) to chirping backward ($\dot f < 0$). The approach we develop can eventually be extended to more complete EMRI waveform models, for example to include effects neglected by the adiabatic approximation such as the conservative self force and spin-curvature coupling.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,A Hard X-Ray Power-Law Spectral Cutoff in Centaurus X-4,"The low-mass X-ray binary Cen X-4 is the brightest and closest (<1.2 kpc) quiescent neutron star transient. Previous 0.5-10 keV X-ray observations of Cen X-4 in quiescence identified two spectral components: soft thermal emission from the neutron star atmosphere and a hard power-law tail of unknown origin. We report here on a simultaneous observation of Cen X-4 with NuSTAR (3-79 keV) and XMM-Newton (0.3-10 keV) in 2013 January, providing the first sensitive hard X-ray spectrum of a quiescent neutron star transient. The 0.3-79 keV luminosity was 1.1 x 10^(33) erg/s (for D=1kpc), with around 60 percent in the thermal component. We clearly detect a cutoff of the hard spectral tail above 10 keV, the first time such a feature has been detected in this source class. We show that thermal Comptonization and synchrotron shock origins for the hard X-ray emission are ruled out on physical grounds. However, the hard X-ray spectrum is well fit by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with an 18 keV electron temperature, which can be understood as arising either in a hot layer above the neutron star atmosphere or in a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). The power-law cutoff energy may be set by the degree of Compton cooling of the bremsstrahlung electrons by thermal seed photons from the neutron star surface. Lower thermal luminosities should lead to higher (possibly undetectable) cutoff energies. We compare Cen~X-4's behavior with PSR J1023+0038, IGR J18245-2452, and XSS J12270-4859, which have shown transitions between LMXB and radio pulsar modes at a similar X-ray luminosity.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Electronic and hole minibands in quantum wire arrays of different crystallographic structure,"We consider quantum wire arrays consisting of GaAs rods embedded in Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As and disposed in sites of a square or triangular lattice. The electronic and hole spectra around the conduction band bottom and the valence band top are examined versus geometry of the lattice formed by the rods, concentration of Al in the matrix material, and structural parameters including the filling fraction and the lattice constant. Our calculations use the envelope function and are based on the effective-mass approximation. We show that the electronic and hole spectra resulting from the periodicity of the heterostructure, depend on the factors considered and that the effect of lattice geometry varies substantially with lattice constant. For low lattice constant values the minigaps are significantly wider in the case of triangular lattice, while for high lattice constant values wider minigaps occur in the square lattice-based arrays. We analyse the consequences of our findings for the efficiency of solar cells based on quantum wire arrays.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Origin of Nonlinear Damping due to Mode Coupling in Auto-Oscillatory Modes Strongly Driven by Spin-Orbit Torque,"We investigate the physical origin of nonlinear damping due to mode coupling between several auto-oscillatory modes driven by spin-orbit torque in constricted Py/Pt heterostructures by examining the dependence of auto-oscillation on temperature and applied field orientation. We observe a transition in the nonlinear damping of the auto-oscillation modes extracted from the total oscillation power as a function of drive current, which coincides with the onset of power redistribution amongst several modes and the crossover from linewidth narrowing to linewidth broadening in all individual modes. This indicates the activation of another relaxation process by nonlinear magnon-magnon scattering within the modes. We also find that both nonlinear damping and threshold current in the mode-interaction damping regime at high drive current after transition are temperature independent, suggesting that the mode coupling occurs dominantly through a non-thermal magnon scattering process via a dipole or exchange interaction rather than thermally excited magnon-mediated scattering. This finding presents a promising pathway to overcome the current limitations of efficiently controlling the interaction between two highly nonlinear magnetic oscillators to prevent mode crosstalk or inter-mode energy transfer and deepens understanding of complex nonlinear spin dynamics in multimode spin wave systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1

Open M2-branes with Flux and Modified Basu-Harvey Equation,"The supersymmetric actions of closed multiple M2 branes with flux for the BL and the ABJM theories have been constructed recently by Lambert and Richmond in \cite{LR}. In this paper we extend the construction to the case of open M2-branes with flux and derive the boundary conditions. This allows us to derive the modified Basu-Harvey equation in the presence of flux. As an example, we consider the Lorentzian BL model. A new feature of the fuzzy funnel solution describing a D2-D4 intersection is obtained as a result of the flux.",hep,hep-th,Symmetry-breaking effects of instantons in parton gauge theories,"Compact quantum electrodynamics (CQED$_3$) with Dirac fermionic matter provides an adequate framework for elucidating the universal low-energy physics of a wide variety of (2+1)D strongly correlated systems. Fractionalized states of matter correspond to its deconfined phases, where the gauge field is effectively noncompact, while conventional broken-symmetry phases are associated with confinement triggered by the proliferation of monopole-instantons. While much attention has been devoted lately to the symmetry classification of monopole operators in massless CQED$_3$ and related 3D conformal field theories, explicit derivations of instanton dynamics in parton gauge theories with fermions have been lacking. In this work, we use semiclassical methods analogous to those used by 't Hooft in the solution of the $U(1)$ problem in 4D quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to explicitly demonstrate the symmetry-breaking effect of instantons in CQED$_3$ with massive fermions, motivated by a fermionic parton description of hard-core bosons on a lattice. By contrast with the massless case studied by Marston, we find that massive fermions possess Euclidean zero modes exponentially localized to the center of the instanton. Such Euclidean zero modes produce in turn an effective four-fermion interaction -- known as the 't Hooft vertex in QCD -- which naturally leads to two possible superfluid phases for the original microscopic bosons: a conventional single-particle condensate or an exotic boson pair condensate without single-particle condensation.",hep,hep-th,1
Perturbative unitarity of Higgs derivative interactions,"We study the perturbative unitarity bound given by dimension six derivative interactions consisting of Higgs doublets. These operators emerge from kinetic terms of composite Higgs models or integrating out heavy particles that interact with Higgs doublets. They lead to new phenomena beyond the Standard Model. One of characteristic contributions by derivative interactions appear in vector boson scattering processes. Longitudinal modes of massive vector bosons can be regarded as Nambu Goldstone bosons eaten by each vector field with the equivalence theorem. Since their effects become larger and larger as the collision energy of vector bosons increases, vector boson scattering processes become important in a high energy region around the TeV scale. On the other hand, in such a high energy region, we have to take the unitarity of amplitudes into account. We have obtained the unitarity condition in terms of the parameter included in the effective Lagrangian for one Higgs doublet models. Applying it to some of models, we have found that contributions of derivative interactions are not so large enough to clearly discriminate them from the Standard Model ones. We also study it in two Higgs doublet models. Because they are too complex to obtain the bound in the general effective Lagrangian, we have calculated it in explicit models. These analyses tell us highly model dependence of the perturbative unitarity bounds.",hep,hep-ph,Effects of new physics on the Standard Model parameters and vice versa,"This note discusses the matter of probing Beyond the Standard Model physics and how, to succeed in this quest, the interpretations of the Standard Model regarding observed phenomena must be utilized with caution. We give several specific examples of why this is necessary and assess general scenarios in which it is specially important. In particular, we call attention to the fact that once the Standard Model (SM) is finally replaced, the parameters of the new theory which embed those of the SM must be rederived directly from data instead of inherited through their expected relations with those of the SM.",hep,hep-ph,1
VERITAS long term monitoring of Gamma-Ray emission from the BL Lacertae object,"BL Lacertae is the prototype of the blazar subclass known as BL Lac type objects. BL Lacertae object itself is a low-frequency-peaked BL Lac(LBL). Very high energy (VHE) gamma ray emission from this source was discovered in 2005 by MAGIC observatory while the source was at a flaring state. Since then, VHE gamma rays from this source has been detected several times. However, all of those times the source was in a high activity state. Former studies suggest several non-thermal zones emitting in gamma-rays, then gamma-ray flare should be composed of a convolution. Observing the BL Lacertae object at quiescent states and active states is the key to disentangle these two components. VERITAS is monitoring the BL Lacertae object since 2011.

Theoretical analysis of single-ion anisotropy in $d^3$ Mott insulators,"An effective spin model for Mott insulators is determined by the symmetries involved among magnetic sites, electron fillings, and their interactions. Such a spin Hamiltonian offers insight to mechanisms of magnetic orders and magnetic anisotropy beyond the Heisenberg model. For a spin moment S bigger than 1/2, single-ion anisotropy is in principle allowed. However, for $d^3$ Mott insulators with large cubic crystal field splitting, the single-ion anisotropy is absent within the LS coupling, despite S = 3/2 local moment. On the other hand, preferred magnetic moment directions in $d^3$ materials have been reported, which calls for a further theoretical investigation. Here we derive the single-ion anisotropy interaction using the strong-coupling perturbation theory. The cubic crystal field splitting including $e_g$ orbitals, trigonal distortions, Hund's coupling, and spin-orbit coupling beyond the LS scheme are taken into account. For compressed distortion, the spin-orbit coupling at magnetic sites can favor either the easy-axis or the easy-plane while that of anions leads to easy-axis anisotropy. We apply the theory on $\rm{CrX}_3$ with X = Cl and I, and show the dependence of the single-ion anisotropy on the strength of the spin-orbit couplings of both magnetic and anion sites. Significance of the single-ion anisotropy in ideal two-dimensional magnets is also discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Thermodynamics of the ferromagnetic phase transition in nearly half metallic CoS2 at high pressures,"The volume change and heat capacity at the ferromagnetic phase transition in CoS2 were measured at high pressures using X-rays generated by the Argonne synchrotron light source and by ac-calorimetry, respectively. The transition entropy, calculated on the basis of these experimental data, drops along the transition line due to quantum degradation, as required by Nernst law. The volume change increases strongly along the transition line, which is explained by specifics of the compressibility difference of coexisting phases that results from nearly half metallic nature of the ferromagnetic phase of CoS2.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Direct T-violation measurements and T-odd effects in decay experiments,"Motivated by the recent experimental announcements for direct measurements of time-reversal non-invariance in the neutral kaon system, we make a comparative discussion of the CPLEAR and KTeV measurements. The most suitable way to consistently incorporate the mixing, the time evolution and the decays of kaons, is to describe the neutral kaon system as a system with a non-Hermitean Hamiltonian. In this framework, the physical (decaying) incoming and outgoing states are distinct and belong to dual spaces. Moreover, since they are eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian, they never oscillate. This is directly manifest in the orthogonality conditions of the physical states, which entirely determine the evolution of the kaon system. Along these lines we conclude: CPLEAR studies K0-bar{K0} oscillations, a process where initial and final states can be reversed, the CPLEAR asymmetry being an effect directly related to the definition of time-reversal. Conclusively, CPLEAR provides a direct measurement of T-violation without any assumption either on unitarity or on CPT-invariance. The KTeV experiment studies in particular the process KL -> pi+ pi- e+ e- where they measure a T-odd effect. However, using unitarity together with estimates of the final state interactions, it should be possible to determine whether this effect can be identified with a genuine T-reversal violation.",hep,hep-ph,How well do we need to measure the Higgs boson mass and self-coupling?,"Much of the discussion regarding future measurements of the Higgs boson mass and self-coupling is focussed on how well various collider options can do. In this article we ask a physics-based question of how well do we need colliders to measure these quantities to have an impact on discovery of new physics or an impact in how we understand the role of the Higgs boson in nature. We address the question within the framework of the Standard Model and various beyond the Standard Model scenarios, including supersymmetry and theories of composite Higgs bosons. We conclude that the LHC's stated ability to measure the Higgs boson to better than 150 MeV will be as good as we will ever need to know the Higgs boson mass in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, we estimate that the self-coupling will likely need to be measured to better than 20 percent to see a deviation from the Standard Model expectation. This is a challenging target for future collider and upgrade scenarios.",hep,hep-ph,1
On Estimating the High-Energy Cutoff in the X-ray Spectra of Black Holes via Reflection Spectroscopy,"The fundamental parameters describing the coronal spectrum of an accreting black hole are the slope $\Gamma$ of the power-law continuum and the energy $E_{cut}$ at which it rolls over. Remarkably, this parameter can be accurately measured for values as high as 1 MeV by modeling the spectrum of X-rays reflected from a black hole accretion disk at energies below 100 keV. This is possible because the details in the reflection spectrum, rich in fluorescent lines and other atomic features, are very sensitive to the spectral shape of the hardest coronal radiation illuminating the disk. We show that fitting simultaneous NuSTAR (3-79 keV) and low-energy (e.g., Suzaku) data with the most recent version of our reflection model RELXILL, one can obtain reasonable constraints on $E_{cut}$ at energies from tens of keV up to 1 MeV, for a source as faint as 1 mCrab in a 100 ks observation.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Radio Variability in Seyfert Nuclei,"Comparison of 8.4-GHz radio images of a sample of 11 early-type Seyfert galaxies with previous observations reveals possible variation in the nuclear radio flux density in 5 of them over a 7-yr period. We find no correlation between radio variability and nuclear radio luminosity or Seyfert nuclear type, although the sample is small and dominated by type 2 Seyferts. Instead, a possible correlation between the presence of nuclear radio variability and the absence of ~100-pc-scale radio emission is seen. NGC2110 is the only source with significant extended radio structure and strong nuclear variability (>38% nuclear decline over seven years). Our results suggest that all Seyferts may exhibit variation in their nuclear radio flux density at 8.4 GHz, but that variability is more easily recognised in compact sources in which emission from the variable nucleus is not diluted by unresolved, constant flux density radio-jet emission within the central ~50 pc. If flares in radio light curves correspond to ejection of new relativistic components or emergence of shocks in the underlying flow, we suggest that radio jets may be intrinsically non-relativistic during quiescence, but that Seyferts, as black-hole driven AGN, have the capacity to accelerate relativistic jets during radio flares. Taken together with the increased detection rate of flat spectrum radio nuclei in Seyferts imaged at VLBI resolutions and the detection of variable water megamaser emission, our results support the paradigm of intermittent periods of quiescence and nuclear outburst across the Seyfert population.

Heart - Shaped Nuclei: Condensation of Rotational Aligned Octupole Phonons,The strong octupole correlations in the mass region $A\approx 226$ are interpreted as rotation-induced condensation of octupole phonons having their angular momentum aligned with the rotational axis. Discrete phonon energy and parity conservation generate oscillations of the energy difference between the lowest rotational bands with positive and negative parity. Anharmonicities tend to synchronize the the rotation of the condensate and the quadrupole shape of the nucleus forming a rotating heart shape.,nucl,nucl-th,Variational Calculation of Relativistic Meson-Nucleon Scattering In Zeroth Order,"We extend the polaron variational treatment previously developed for the propagator to the case where one nucleon and $n$ external mesons are present. Using the particle representation of the scalar Wick-Cutkosky model this is done in lowest order of an expansion of the exact action around a retarded quadratic trial action. In particular, we evaluate the form factor for scattering of mesons from the scalar nucleon and determine the radius of the dressed particle. After analytic continuation to Minkowski space we study elastic meson-nucleon scattering both analytically and numerically near threshold and show that it is essential to incorporate the correct behaviour of the retardation function at large proper times. Only if this is done the optical theorem is approximately fulfilled over a range of energies and coupling constants.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Tuning the magnetic properties of Fe50-xMnxPt50 thin films,"The magnetic and structural properties of highly ordered (S ~ 0.82) epitaxial Fe50-xMnxPt50 thin films were investigated. We report the change in the magnetic properties of Mn doped FePt epitaxial thin films. This study differs from the earlier experimental studies on Mn doped FePt based alloys. Ordered L10 Fe50-xMnxPt50 (x=0, 6, 9, 12 and 15) thin films with a constant thickness of 45 nm were prepared by co-sputtering Fe50Pt50 and Mn50Pt50 on to MgO (100) single crystal substrate. We find a significant increase in the coercivity for Fe-Mn-Pt thin films. We have shown that this increase in magnetic properties coincide with the tetragonal distortion, while the recent first principles study of Mn doped FePt showed the sub lattice ordering of ferromagnetically aligned Mn atoms would lead to increase in magnetic properties in the FeMnPt ternary alloy system with fixed Pt concentration. At x=12 the coercivity has increased by 46.4 % when compared to Fe50Pt50. The increase in magnetic properties in Fe50-xMnxPt50 is due to the tetragonal distortion as experimental c/a ratio is larger than the expected c/a ratio for ferromagnetically ordered Mn atoms in the sublattice at the concentration x=12. Thus we show that high temperature deposition and high temperature annealing is one of the methods to achieve large coercivity in Mn doped FePt as it leads to tetragonal distortion.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Six-Dimensional Quantum Dynamics of Adsorption and Desorption of H_2 at Pd(100): Steering and Steric Effects,"We report the first six-dimensional quantum dynamical calculations of dissociative adsorption and associative desorption. Using a potential energy surface obtained by density functional theory calculations, we show that the initial decrease of the sticking probability with increasing kinetic energy in the system H_2/Pd(100), which is usually attributed to the existence of a molecular adsorption state, is due to dynamical steering. In addition, we examine the influence of rotational motion and orientation of the hydrogen molecule on adsorption and desorption.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Propagation of non-classical states of light through one-dimensional photonic lattices,"We study the propagation of non-classical light through arrays of coupled linear photonic waveguides and introduce some sets of refractive indices and coupling parameters that provide a closed form propagator in terms of orthogonal polynomials. We present propagation examples of non-classical states of light: single photon, coherent state, path-entangled state and two-mode squeezed vacuum impinging into two-waveguide couplers and a photonic lattice producing coherent transport.",physics,physics.optics,Design Principles for Plasmonic Nanoparticle Devices,For all applications of plasmonics to technology it is required to tailor the resonance to the optical system in question. This chapter gives an understanding of the design considerations for nanoparticles needed to tune the resonance. First the basic concepts of plasmonics are reviewed with a focus on the physics of nanoparticles. An introduction to the finite element method is given with emphasis on the suitability of the method to nanoplasmonic device simulation. The effects of nanoparticle shape on the spectral position and lineshape of the plasmonic resonance are discussed including retardation and surface curvature effects. The most technologically important plasmonic materials are assessed for device applicability and the importance of substrates in light scattering is explained. Finally the application of plasmonic nanoparticles to photovoltaic devices is discussed.,physics,physics.optics,1
Comparison of Recent SnIa datasets,"We rank the six latest Type Ia supernova (SnIa) datasets (Constitution (C), Union (U), ESSENCE (Davis) (E), Gold06 (G), SNLS 1yr (S) and SDSS-II (D)) in the context of the Chevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(a)=w_0+w_1 (1-a)$, according to their Figure of Merit (FoM), their consistency with the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM), their consistency with standard rulers (Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)) and their mutual consistency. We find a significant improvement of the FoM (defined as the inverse area of the 95.4% parameter contour) with the number of SnIa of these datasets ((C) highest FoM, (U), (G), (D), (E), (S) lowest FoM). Standard rulers (CMB+BAO) have a better FoM by about a factor of 3, compared to the highest FoM SnIa dataset (C). We also find that the ranking sequence based on consistency with $\Lambda$CDM is identical with the corresponding ranking based on consistency with standard rulers ((S) most consistent, (D), (C), (E), (U), (G) least consistent). The ranking sequence of the datasets however changes when we consider the consistency with an expansion history corresponding to evolving dark energy $(w_0,w_1)=(-1.4,2)$ crossing the phantom divide line $w=-1$ (it is practically reversed to (G), (U), (E), (S), (D), (C)). The SALT2 and MLCS2k2 fitters are also compared and some peculiar features of the SDSS-II dataset when standardized with the MLCS2k2 fitter are pointed out. Finally, we construct a statistic to estimate the internal consistency of a collection of SnIa datasets. We find that even though there is good consistency among most samples taken from the above datasets, this consistency decreases significantly when the Gold06 (G) dataset is included in the sample.",hep,hep-ph,Exploring anomalous $hb\bar b$ and $h b\bar b\gamma$ couplings in the context of the LHC and an $e^+e^-$ collider,"In the light of the 125 GeV Higgs ($h$) discovery at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), one of the primary goals of the LHC and possible future colliders is to understand its interactions more precisely. Here we have studied the $h$-$b$-$\bar b$-$\gamma$ effective interaction terms arising out of gauge invariant dimension six operators in a model independent setting, as a potential source of new physics. Their role in some detectable final states have been compared with those coming from anomalous $h$-$b$-$\bar b$ interactions. We have considered the bounds coming from the existing collider and other low energy experimental data in order to derive constraints on the potential new physics couplings and predict possible collider signals for the two different new physics scenarios in the context of 14 TeV LHC and and a future $e^+e^-$ machine. We conclude that the anomalous $h$-$b$-$\bar b$-$\gamma$ coupling can be probed at the LHC at 14 TeV at the 3$\sigma$ level with an integrated luminosity of $\sim 2000~{\rm fb}^{-1}$, which an $e^+e^-$ collider can probe at the 3$\sigma$ level with $\sim 12(7)~{\rm fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=250(500)~{\rm GeV}$. It is also found that anomalous $h$-$b$-$\bar b$ interactions, subject to the existing LHC constraints, can not compete with the rates driven by $h$-$b$-$\bar b$-$\gamma$ effective interactions.",hep,hep-ph,1
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition in Two-Dimensional Dipolar Stripes,"A two-dimensional quantum system of dipoles, with a polarization angle not perpendicular to the plane, shows a transition from a gas to a stripe phase. We have studied the thermal properties of these two phases using the path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method. By simulating the thermal density matrix, PIMC provides exact results for magnitudes of interest such as the superfluid fraction and the one-body density matrix. As it is well known, in two dimensions the superfluid-to-normal phase transition follows the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) scenario. Our results show that both the anisotropic gas and the stripe phases follow the BKT scaling laws. At fixed density and increasing the tilting angle, the transition temperature decreases in going from the gas to the stripe phase. Superfluidity in the perpendicular direction to the stripes is rather small close to the critical temperature but it becomes larger at lower temperatures, mainly close to the transition to the gas. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the supersolidity observed recently in a quasi-one-dimensional array of dipolar droplets.",cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,Temperature-driven crossover in the Lieb-Liniger model,The large-distance behavior of the density-density correlation function in the Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature is investigated by means of the recently derived nonlinear integral equations characterizing the correlation lengths. We present extensive numerical results covering all the physical regimes fromweak to strong interaction and all temperatures. We find that the leading term of the asymptotic expansion becomes oscillatory at a critical temperature which decreases with the strength of the interaction. As we approach the Tonks-Girardeau limit the asymptotic behavior becomes more complex with a double crossover of the largest and next-largest correlation lengths. The crossovers exist only for intermediate couplings and vanish for $\gamma=0$ and $\gamma=\infty$.,cond-mat,cond-mat.quant-gas,1
Central frequency of few-cycle laser pulses in strong-field processes,"We analyze the role of the difference between the central frequencies of the spectral distributions of the vector potential and the electric field of a short laser pulse. The frequency shift arises when the electric field is determined as the derivative of the vector potential to ensure that both quantities vanish at the beginning and end of the pulse. We derive an analytical estimate of the frequency shift and show how it affects various light induced processes, such as excitation, ionization and high harmonic generation. Since observables depend on the frequency spectrum of the electric field, the shift should be taken into account when setting the central frequency of the vector potential to avoid potential misinterpretation of numerical results for processes induced by few-cycle pulses.",physics,physics.atom-ph,Effective renormalized multi-body interactions of harmonically confined ultracold neutral bosons,"We calculate the renormalized effective 2-, 3-, and 4-body interactions for N neutral ultracold bosons in the ground state of an isotropic harmonic trap, assuming 2-body interactions modeled with the combination of a zero-range and energy-dependent pseudopotential. We work to third-order in the scattering length a defined at zero collision energy, which is necessary to obtain both the leading-order effective 4-body interaction and consistently include finite-range corrections for realistic 2-body interactions. The leading-order, effective 3- and 4-body interaction energies are U3 = -(0.85576...)(a/l)^2 + 2.7921(1)(a/l)^3 + O[(a/l)^4] and U4 = +(2.43317...)(a/l)^3 + O[(a\l)^4], where w and l are the harmonic oscillator frequency and length, respectively, and energies are in units of hbar*w. The one-standard deviation error 0.0001 for the third-order coefficient in U3 is due to numerical uncertainty in estimating a slowly converging sum; the other two coefficients are either analytically or numerically exact. The effective 3- and 4-body interactions can play an important role in the dynamics of tightly confined and strongly correlated systems. We also performed numerical simulations for a finite-range boson-boson potential, and it was comparison to the zero-range predictions which revealed that finite-range effects must be taken into account for a realistic third-order treatment. In particular, we show that the energy-dependent pseudopotential accurately captures, through third order, the finite-range physics, and in combination with the multi-body effective interactions gives excellent agreement with the numerical simulations, validating our theoretical analysis and predictions.",physics,physics.atom-ph,1
Inhibition of the dynamical Casimir effect with Robin boundary conditions,"We consider a real massless scalar field in 3+1 dimensions satisfying a Robin boundary condition at a nonrelativistic moving mirror. Considering vacuum as the initial field state, we compute explicitly the number of particles created per unit frequency and per unit solid angle, exhibiting in this way the angular dependence of the spectral distribution. The well known cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions may be reobtained as particular cases from our results. We show that the particle creation rate can be considerably reduced (with respect to the Dirichlet and Neumann cases) for particular values of the Robin parameter. Our results extend for 3+1 dimensions previous results found in the literature for 1+1 dimensions. Further, we also show that this inhibition of the dynamical Casimir effect occurs for different angles of particle emission.",hep,hep-th,Non-Abelian Black Holes and Catastrophe Theory II: Charged Type,"We reanalyze the gravitating monopole and its black hole solutions in the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system and we discuss their stabilities from the point of view of catastrophe theory. Although these non-trivial solutions exhibit fine and complicated structures, we find that stability is systematically understood via a swallow tail catastrophe. The Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m trivial solution becomes unstable from the point where the non-trivial monopole black hole appears. We also find that, within a very small parameter range, the specific heat of a monopole black hole changes its sign .",hep,hep-th,1
Q-Deformed Bi-Local Fields,"We study the q-deformation of the bi-local system, two particle system, bounded by a relativistic harmonic oscillator type of potential from both points of view of mass spectra and the behavior of scattering amplitudes. In particular, we try to formulate the deformation so that $P^2$, the square of center of mass momenta, enters into the deformation parameters of relative coordinates. As a result, the wave equation of the bi-local system becomes non-linear one with respect to $P^2$; then, the propagator of the bi-local system suffers significant change so as to get a convergent self energy to second order.",hep,hep-th,Thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz analysis in an SU(2)xU(1) symmetric sigma-model,"Four different types of free energies are computed by both thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz (TBA) techniques and by weak coupling perturbation theory in an integrable one-parameter deformation of the O(4) principal chiral sigma-model (with SU(2)xU(1) symmetry). The model exhibits both `fermionic' and `bosonic' type free energies and in all cases the perturbative and the TBA results are in perfect agreement, strongly supporting the correctness of the proposed S matrix. The mass gap is also computed in terms of the Lambda parameters of the modified minimal substraction scheme and a lattice regularized version of the model.",hep,hep-th,1
Non-perturbative renormalization: a new way,"The notion of non-perturbative renormalization is discussed and extended. Within the extended picture, a new non-perturbative representation for the generating functional of Green functions of quantum field theories is suggested. It is argued that the new expression agrees with the standard renormalized perturbation theory if the latter is renormalized in an appropriate renormalization scheme.",hep,hep-ph,Instantons in QCD with Many Colors,We study instantons in QCD with many colors. We first discuss a number of qualitative arguments concerning the large N_c scaling behavior of a random instanton ensemble. We show that most hadronic observables are compatible with standard large N_c counting rules provided the average instanton size is O(1) and the instanton density is O(N_c) in the large N_c limit. This is not the case for the topological susceptibility and the mass of the eta'. For these observables consistency with conventional large N_c counting requires that fluctuations in the instanton liquid are suppressed compared to Poissonian fluctuations. Using mean field estimates and numerical simulations we show that the required scaling behavior of the instanton density is natural in models in which the instanton density is regularized in terms of a classical repulsive core. We also show that in these models fluctuations of the topological charge are suppressed and that m^2_eta'=O(1/N_c). We conclude that the instanton liquid model is not necessarily in conflict with the 1/N_c expansion.,hep,hep-ph,1
Quantum model for mode locking in pulsed semiconductor quantum dots,"Quantum dots in GaAs/InGaAs structures have been proposed as a candidate system for realizing quantum computing. The short coherence time of the electronic quantum state that arises from coupling to the nuclei of the substrate is dramatically increased if the system is subjected to a magnetic field and to repeated optical pulsing. This enhancement is due to mode locking: Oscillation frequencies resonant with the pulsing frequencies are enhanced, while off-resonant oscillations eventually die out. Because the resonant frequencies are determined by the pulsing frequency only, the system becomes immune to frequency shifts caused by the nuclear coupling and by slight variations between individual quantum dots. The effects remain even after the optical pulsing is terminated. In this work, we explore the phenomenon of mode locking from a quantum mechanical perspective. We treat the dynamics using the central spin model, which includes coupling to 10-20 nuclei and incoherent decay of the excited electronic state, in a perturbative framework. Using scaling arguments, we extrapolate our results to realistic system parameters. We find that the synchronization to the pulsing frequency needs time scales in the order of 1 s.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect: the topological inequivalence of skin modes versus point gap,"Non-Hermitian skin effect, the localization of an extensive number of eigenstates at the ends of the system, has greatly expanded the frontier of physical laws. It has long been believed that the present of skin modes is equivalent to the topologically nontrivial point gap of complex eigenvalues under periodic boundary conditions, and vice versa. However, we find that this concomitance can be broken, i.e., the skin modes can be present or absent whereas the point gap is topologically trivial or nontrivial, respectively, named anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect. This anomalous phenomenon arises when the unidirectional hopping amplitudes leading to the decoupling-like behaviors among subsystems are emergence. The emergence of the anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect is accompanied by the mutations of the open boundary energy spectrum, whose structure exhibits the multifold exceptional point and can not be recovered by continuum bands. Moreover, an experimental setup using circuits is proposed to simulate this novel quantum effect. Our results reveal the topologically inequivalent between skin modes and point gap. This new effect not only can give a deeper understanding of non-Bloch theory and the critical phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems, but may also inspire new applications such as in the sensors field.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Cosmic Microwave Background constraints for global strings and global monopoles,"We present the first CMB power spectra from numerical simulations of the global O(N) linear $\sigma$-model with N = 2,3, which have global strings and monopoles as topological defects. In order to compute the CMB power spectra we compute the unequal time correlators (UETCs) of the energy-momentum tensor, showing that they fall off at high wave number faster than naive estimates based on the geometry of the defects, indicating non-trivial (anti-)correlations between the defects and the surrounding Goldstone boson field. We obtain source functions for Einstein-Boltzmann solvers from the UETCs, using a recent method that improves the modelling at the radiation- matter transition. We show that the interpolation function that mimics the transition is similar to other defect models, but not identical, confirming the non-universality of the interpolation function. The CMB power spectra for global strings and monopoles have the same overall shape as those obtained using the non-linear $\sigma$-model approximation, which is well captured by a large-N calculation. However, the amplitudes are larger than the large-N calculation predict, and in the case of global strings much larger: a factor of 20 at the peak. Finally we compare the CMB power spectra with the latest CMB data to put limits on the allowed contribution to the temperature power spectrum at multipole $\ell$ = 10 of 1.7% for global strings and 2.4% for global monopoles. These limits correspond to symmetry-breaking scales of 2.9x1015 GeV (6.3x1014 GeV with the expected logarithmic scaling of the effective string tension between the simulation time and decoupling) and 6.4x1015 GeV respectively. The bound on global strings is a significant one for the ultra-light axion scenario with axion masses ma 10-28 eV. These upper limits indicate that gravitational wave from global topological defects will not be observable at the GW observatory LISA.",hep,hep-th,On the gauge orbit space stratification (a review),"First, we review the basic mathematical structures and results concerning the gauge orbit space stratification. This includes general properties of the gauge group action, fibre bundle structures induced by this action, basic properties of the stratification and the natural Riemannian structures of the strata. In the second part, we study the stratification for theories with gauge group $\rmSU(n)$ in space time dimension 4. We develop a general method for determining the orbit types and their partial ordering, based on the 1-1 correspondence between orbit types and holonomy-induced Howe subbundles of the underlying principal $\rmSU(n)$-bundle. We show that the orbit types are classified by certain cohomology elements of space time satisfying two relations and that the partial ordering is characterized by a system of algebraic equations. Moreover, operations for generating direct successors and direct predecessors are formulated, which allow one to construct the set of orbit types, starting from the principal one. Finally, we discuss an application to nodal configurations in topological Chern-Simons theory.",hep,hep-th,1
Smectic and columnar ordering in length-polydisperse fluids of parallel hard cylinders,"We apply a recently proposed density functional for mixtures of parallel hard cylinders, based on Rosenfeld's fundamental measure theory, to study the effect of length-polydispersity on the relative stability between the smectic and columnar liquid crystal phases.To this purpose we derive from this functional an expression for the direct correlation function and use it to perform a bifurcation analysis. We compare the results with those obtained with a second and a third virial approximation of this function. All three approximations lead to the same conclusion: there is a terminal polydispersity beyond which the smectic phase is less stable than the columnar phase. This result is in agreement with previous Monte Carlo simulations conducted on a freely rotating length-polydisperse hard spherocylinder fluid, although the theories always overestimate the terminal polydispersity because the nematic-columnar phase transition is first order and exhibits a wide coexistence gap. Both, the fundamental-measure functional and the third virial approximation, predict a metastable nematic-nematic demixing. Conversely, according to second virial approximation this demixing might be stable at high values of the polydispersity, something that is observed neither in simulations nor in experiments. The results of the fundamental-measure functional are quantitatively superior to those obtained from the other two approximations. Thus this functional provides a promising route to map out the full phase diagram of this system.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Nonlocal tensor order parameter of the deformed state of liquid crystals,"A generalized notion of a nonlocal tensor order parameter is introduced within the framework of the phenomenological approach. This parameter has the form of a traceless tensor correlation function or a tensor integral operator. Based on this form, the governing relations are written, which determine the steady states and phase transitions of the deformed liquid crystal. Linear relations for eigenfunctions of the introduced operator are derived. A principal drawback of currently available models of liquid crystals based on the local presentation of the tensor order parameter (equality of two Frank constants in the case of a quadratic form of the strain part of the free energy) is eliminated. Particular examples are considered, which demonstrate the model workability and the absence of contradictions in the model as well as its adequacy when describing small-scale structures.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Resolving the extended atmosphere and the inner wind of Mira ($o$ Ceti) with long ALMA baselines,"The prototypical Mira variable, $o$ Cet (Mira), has been observed as a Science Verification target in the 2014 ALMA Long Baseline Campaign with a longest baseline of 15 km. ALMA clearly resolves the images of the continuum and molecular line emission/absorption at an angular resolution of ~30 mas at 220 GHz. We image the data of the $^{28}$SiO v=0, 2 $J$=5-4 and H$_2$O $\nu_2$=1 $J(K_a,K_c)$=5(5,0)-6(4,3) transitions and extract spectra from various lines-of-sight towards Mira's extended atmosphere. In the course of imaging, we encountered ambiguities in the resulting images and spectra that appear to be related to the performance of the CLEAN algorithm. We resolve Mira's millimetre continuum emission and our data are consistent with a radio photosphere with a brightness temperature of 2611$\pm$51 K, in agreement with recent results obtained with the VLA. We do not confirm the existence of a compact region (<5 mas) of enhanced brightness. We derive the gas density, kinetic temperature, molecular abundance and outflow/infall velocities in Mira's extended atmosphere by modelling the SiO and H$_2$O lines. We find that SiO-bearing gas starts to deplete beyond 4$R_\star$ and at a kinetic temperature of $\lesssim$600 K. The inner dust shells are probably composed of grain types other than pure silicates. During this observation, Mira's atmosphere generally exhibited infall motion, with a shock front of velocity $\lesssim$12 km/s outside the radio photosphere. The structures predicted by the hydrodynamical model CODEX can reproduce the observed spectra in astonishing detail; while some other models fail when confronted with the new data. Combined with radiative transfer modelling, ALMA successfully demonstrates the ability to reveal the physical conditions of the extended atmospheres and inner winds of AGB stars in unprecedented detail.

After establishing a background to the newly emergent field of GPU computing, I discuss the code design and narrate key parts of its source. Benchmarking calculations indicate no significant differences in accuracy compared to an equivalent CPU-based code. However, the differences in performance are pronounced; running on a low-end GPU, the code can match 8 CPU cores, and on a high-end GPU it is faster by a factor approaching thirty. Applications of the code include analysis of long photometric time series obtained by ongoing satellite missions and upcoming ground-based monitoring facilities; and Monte-Carlo simulation of periodogram statistical properties.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Excitonic switches at 100 K temperatures,"Photonic and optoelectronic devices may offer the opportunity to realize efficient signal processing at speeds higher than in conventional electronic devices. Switches form the building blocks for circuits and fast photonic switches have been realized [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Recently, proof of principle of exciton optoelectronic devices was demonstrated [7,8]. Potential advantages of excitonic devices include high operation and interconnection speed, small dimensions, and the opportunity to combine many elements into integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate experimental proof of principle for the operation of excitonic switching devices at temperatures around 100 K. The devices are based on an AlAs/GaAs coupled quantum well structure and include the exciton optoelectronic transistor (EXOT), the excitonic bridge modulator (EXBM), and the excitonic pinch-off modulator (EXPOM). This is a two orders of magnitude increase in the operation temperature compared to the earlier devices, where operation was demonstrated at 1.5 K [7,8].",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Renormalization of the dephasing by zero point fluctuations,"We study the role of zero-point-fluctuations (ZPF) in dephasing at low temperature. Unlike the Caldeira-Leggett model where the interaction is with an homogeneous fluctuating field of force, here we consider the effect of short range scattering by localized bath modes. We find that in presence of ZPF the inelastic cross-section gets renormalized. Thus indirectly ZPF might contribute to the dephasing at low temperature.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Shear viscosity of an ultrarelativistic Boltzmann gas with isotropic inelastic scattering processes,We derive an analytic expression for the shear viscosity of an ultra-relativistic gas in presence of both elastic $2\to 2$ and inelastic $2\leftrightarrow 3$ processes with isotropic differential cross sections. The derivation is based on the entropy principle and Grad's approximation for the off-equilibrium distribution function. The obtained formula relates the shear viscosity coefficient $\eta$ to the total cross sections $\sigma_{22}$ and $\sigma_{23}$ of the elastic resp. inelastic processes. The values of shear viscosity extracted using the Green-Kubo formula from kinetic transport calculations are shown to be in excellent agreement with the analytic results which demonstrates the validity of the derived formula.,hep,hep-th,Recovering information in an asymptotically flat spacetime in quantum gravity,"As an extension of arXiv:\{2002.02448, 2008.10740\} we present a physical protocol that a set of observers can use to detect a pure state in the bulk when they are spread across a small cut near $\mathcal{I}^+_-$ in flat spacetime. The protocol involves the modification of a bulk state using simple unitary operators and measurements of the energy of the state. The states that we study are constructed by acting with low energy operators on a vacuum state such that a perturbative analysis is valid. We restrict ourselves to $3+1$ dimensional spacetimes and only consider massless excitations. From this analysis, the principle of holography of information becomes manifest in the case of asymptotically flat spacetime.",hep,hep-th,1

Affleck-Dine Baryogenesis and Inflation in Supergravity with Strongly Stabilized Moduli,"Constructing models of inflation and/or baryogenesis in the context of N=1 supergravity is known to be difficult as the finite energy density during inflation typically generates large (order the Hubble scale) mass terms. This is the well-known eta problem in inflation. The same effect gives masses along low energy flat directions of the scalar potential thus potentially preventing Affleck-Dine baryogenesis to occur. It has been shown that adding a chiral multiplet S coupled to the inflaton (with a shift symmetry) can serve to stabilize the inflationary potential and allows one to derive simple inflationary potentials without an eta problem. Here, we show that by coupling the same stabilizing field S to the flat direction, may naturally lead to a negative mass-squared contribution to the flat direction thus generating the necessarily large vacuum expectation value needed to realize Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. We trace the evolution of the inflaton, stabilizer, and flat direction field, as well as a Polonyi-like modulus responsible for soft supersymmetry breaking.",hep,hep-ph,The NNLO QCD analysis ofthe CCFR data for $xF_3$: $Q^2$-dependence of the parameters,"We continue the systematic next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD analysis of the CCFR data for $xF_3$ SF. The NNLO results forthe $Q^2$-dependence of the parameters, which describe the $x$-dependence of this SF, are presented.",hep,hep-ph,1
Heavy quark production and spectroscopy at HERA,Heavy flavour production and spectroscopy are key components of the HERA physics programme. I will summarise a selection of the recent results obtained by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations. The production of excited charm mesons and J/psi will be discussed as well as measurements of b quark cross-sections in photoproduction. The status of searches for exotic bound states and the D*p resonance will be updated.,hep,hep-ex,"Production of pi+, pi-, K+, K-, p and p-bar in Light (uds), c and b Jets from Z0 Decays","We present improved measurements of the differential production rates of stable charged particles in hadronic Z0 decays, and of charged pions, kaons and protons identified over a wide momentum range using the SLD Cherenkov Ring Imaging Detector. In addition to flavor-inclusive Z0 decays, measurements are made for Z0 decays into light (u, d, s), c and b primary flavors, selected using the upgraded Vertex Detector. Large differences between the flavors are observed that are qualitatively consistent with expectations based upon previously measured production and decay properties of heavy hadrons. These results are used to test the predictions of QCD in the Modified Leading Logarithm Approximation, with the ansatz of Local Parton-Hadron Duality, and the predictions of three models of the hadronization process. The light-flavor results provide improved tests of these predictions, as they do not include the contribution of heavy-hadron production and decay; the heavy-flavor results provide complementary model tests. In addition we have compared hadron and antihadron production in light quark (as opposed to antiquark) jets. Differences are observed at high momentum for all three charged hadron species, providing direct probes of leading particle effects, and stringent constraints on models.",hep,hep-ex,1
Integrable Superhierarchy of Discretized 2d Supergravity,The hierarchical nonlinear super-differential equations are identified which describe universal behavior of the discretized model of $2d$ supergravity recently proposed. This is done by first taking a double scaling limit of the super Virasoro constraints ( at finite $N$) of the model and by rederiving it from the $\tilde{G}_{-1/2}$ constraint and the two reduction of the super KP hierarchy discussed. The double-scaled constraints are found to be described by a twisted scalar and a Ramond fermion.,hep,hep-th,Tachyon Condensates and Anisotropic Universe,We investigate the cosmological solutions in closed bosonic string theory in the presence of non zero tachyon condensate. We specifically obtain time dependent solutions which describe an anisotropic universe. We also discuss the nature of such time dependent solutions when small tachyon fluctuations around the condensate are taken into account.,hep,hep-th,1
Exact and Approximate Radiation Amplitude Zeros --- Phenomenological Aspects,We review the phenomenological aspects of the exact and approximate Radiation Amplitude Zeros (RAZ) and discuss the prospects of searches for these zeros at current and future collider experiments.,hep,hep-ph,T-Quarks at the Large Hadron Collider: 2010-12,"We study the potential of the current Large Hadron Collider (LHC) 7 TeV run to search for heavy, colored vector-like fermions, which are assumed to carry a conserved Z2 quantum number forcing them to be pair-produced. Each fermion is assumed to decay directly into a Standard Model quark and an invisible stable particle. T-odd quarks (T-quarks) and the lightest T-odd particle (LTP) of the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity provide an example of this setup. We estimate the bounds based on the published CMS search for events with jets and missing transverse energy in the 35 pb-1 data set collected in the 2010 run. We find that T-quark masses below about 450 GeV are ruled out for the LTP mass about 100 GeV. This bound is somewhat stronger than the published Tevatron constraint. We also estimate the reach with higher integrated luminosities expected in the 2011-12 run. If no deviation from the SM is observed, we expect that a bound on the T-quark mass of about 650 GeV, for the LTP mass of 300 GeV and below, can be achieved with 1 fb-1 of data. We comment on the possibility of using initial-state radiation jets to constrain the region with nearly-degenerate T-quark and LTP.",hep,hep-ph,1
Astrophysical and theoretical physics implications from multimessenger neutron star observations,"The Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) recently measured the mass and equatorial radius of the isolated neutron star PSR J0030+0451. We use these measurements to infer the moment of inertia, the quadrupole moment, and the surface eccentricity of an isolated neutron star for the first time, using relations between these quantities that are insensitive to the unknown equation of state of supranuclear matter. We also use these results to forecast the moment of inertia of neutron star A in the double pulsar binary J0737-3039, a quantity anticipated to be directly measured in the coming decade with radio observations. Combining this information with the measurement of the tidal Love number with LIGO/Virgo observations, we propose and implement the first theory-agnostic and equation-of-state-insensitive test of general relativity. Specializing these constraints to a particular modified theory, we find that consistency with general relativity places the most stringent constraint on gravitational parity violation to date, surpassing all other previously reported bounds by seven orders of magnitude and opens the path for future a test of general relativity with multimessenger neutron star observations.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Directional correlations between UHECRs and neutrinos observed with IceCube,"Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) above an energy threshold of tens of EeV might undergo only small deflections due to interstellar magnetic fields. Their arrival directions would then point to regions of possible hadronic acceleration processes, which are likely to be also sources of high energy neutrinos. To search for such cosmic accelerators, we present here the first high statistics analysis of directional correlations between neutrino candidates from the IceCube Observatory and UHECR events. Data taken with IceCube in a configuration of 22 strings provided the basis for using published events from both the Pierre Auger Observatory and the HiRes experiment as reference directions in a search for coincidences with neutrinos. The analysis was optimized according to strict blindness criteria and showed an excess of neutrino candidates close to UHECR directions with a probability of 1% to occur as a random fluctuation, consistent with a background-only hypothesis. An extension of this analysis to include newer IceCube data, taken with 40 strings and using a likelihood approach, is discussed in the outlook.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Weak Nonleptonic Omega Decay in Chiral Perturbation Theory,We calculate the weak nonleptonic decay of the Omega^- baryon to octet final states in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBChPT). We include the one-loop leading logarithmic effects and show that this improves the universality of the HBChPT constants.,hep,hep-ph,Meta-stable Vacuum in Spontaneously Broken N=2 Supersymmetric Gauge Theory,"We consider an N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) \times U(1) gauge theory with N_f=2 massless flavors and a Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term. In the presence of the FI term, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at tree level (on the Coulomb branch), leaving a pseudo-flat direction in the classical potential. This vacuum degeneracy is removed once quantum corrections are taken into account. Due to the SU(2) gauge dynamics, the effective potential exhibits a local minimum at the dyon point, where not only supersymmetry but also U(1)_R symmetry is broken, while a supersymmetric vacuum would be realized toward infinity with the runaway behavior of the potential. This local minimum is found to be parametrically long-lived. Interestingly, from a phenomenological point of view, in this meta-stable vacuum the massive hypermultiplets inherent in the theory play the role of the messenger fields in the gauge mediation scenario, when the Standard Model gauge group is embedded into their flavor symmetry.",hep,hep-ph,1
Holographic microstate counting for AdS$_4$ black holes in massive IIA supergravity,"We derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a class of BPS black holes in the massive type IIA supergravity background AdS$_4 \times S^6$ from a microscopic counting of supersymmetric ground states in a holographically dual field theory. The counting is performed by evaluating the topologically twisted index of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter gauge theories in the large $N$ limit. The $\mathcal{I}$-extremization principle is shown to match the attractor mechanism for the near-horizon geometries constructed in the four-dimensional dyonic $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity, that arises as a consistent truncation of massive type IIA supergravity on $S^6$. In particular, our results prove that the imaginary part of the three-dimensional partition functions plays a crucial r\^ole in holography.",hep,hep-th,Mach's principle and dark matter,"In this paper we entertain a Machian setting where local physics is non-locally affected by the whole Universe, taking the liberty to identify the local (``Newton's bucket'') with our visible Universe, and the whole Universe (Mach's ``fixed stars'') with the global Universe beyond our horizon. Crucially, we allow for the two to have different properties, so that we are beyond the traditional FRW setting. For definiteness we focus on theories where non-locality arises from evolution in the laws of physics in terms of spatially global time variables dual to the constants of Nature. Since non-local theories are foliation-dependent, the {\it local} (but not the global) Hamiltonian constraint is lost. This is true not only while non-locality is taking place, but also after it ceases: the local Hamiltonian constraint is only recovered up to a constant in time, keeping a memory of the integrated past non-locality. We show that this integration constant is equivalent to preserving the local Hamiltonian constraint and adding an extra fluid with the same cosmological properties as conventional pressureless dark matter. The equivalence breaks down in terms of clustering properties, with the new component attracting other matter, but not budging from its location. This is the ultimate ``painted-on'' dark matter, attracting but not being attracted, and nailing down a preferred frame.",hep,hep-th,1
Life after eruption - II. The eclipsing old nova V728 Scorpii,"The old nova V728 Sco has been recently recovered via photometric and spectroscopic observations, 150 years after the nova eruption. The spectral properties pointed to a high-inclination system with a comparatively low mass-transfer rate. In this paper we show that the object is an eclipsing system with an orbital period of 3.32 h. It has enhanced long-term variability that can be interpreted as 'stunted' dwarf-nova-type outbursts. Using the ingress and egress times of the eclipsed components we calculate the radius of the central object. The latter turns out to be significantly larger than a white dwarf and we identify it with a hot inner disc. The implications for models on the behaviour of post-novae are discussed.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Hyperons in neutron-star cores and two-solar-mass pulsar,"Recent measurement of mass of PSR J1614-2230 rules out most of existing models of equation of state (EOS) of dense matter with high-density softening due to hyperonization or a phase transition to quark matter or a boson condensate. We look for a solution of an apparent contradiction between the consequences stemming from up-to-date hypernuclear data, indicating appearance of hyperons at 3 nuclear densities and existence of a two-solar-mass neutron star. We consider a non-linear relativistic mean field (RMF) model involving baryon octet coupled to meson fields. An effective lagrangian includes quartic terms in the meson fields. The values of the parameters of the model are obtained by fitting semi-empirical parameters of nuclear matter at the saturation point, as well as potential wells for hyperons in nuclear matter and the strength of the Lambda-Lambda attraction in double-Lambda hypernuclei. We propose a non-linear RMF model which is consistent with up-to-date semiempirical nuclear and hypernuclear data and allows for neutron stars with hyperon cores and M larger than 2 solar masses. The model involves hidden-strangenes scalar and vector mesons, coupled to hyperons only, and quartic terms involving vector meson fields. Our EOS involving hyperons is stiffer than the corresponding nucleonic EOS (with hyperons artificially suppressed) above five nuclear densities. Required stiffening is generated by the quartic terms involving hidden-strangeness vector meson.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Mining Application-aware Community Organization with Expanded Feature Subspaces from Concerned Attributes in Social Networks,"Social networks are typical attributed networks with node attributes. Different from traditional attribute community detection problem aiming at obtaining the whole set of communities in the network, we study an application-oriented problem of mining an application-aware community organization with respect to specific concerned attributes. The concerned attributes are designated based on the requirements of any application by a user in advance. The application-aware community organization w.r.t. concerned attributes consists of the communities with feature subspaces containing these concerned attributes. Besides concerned attributes, feature subspace of each required community may contain some other relevant attributes. All relevant attributes of a feature subspace jointly describe and determine the community embedded in such subspace. Thus the problem includes two subproblems, i.e., how to expand the set of concerned attributes to complete feature subspaces and how to mine the communities embedded in the expanded subspaces. Two subproblems are jointly solved by optimizing a quality function called subspace fitness. An algorithm called ACM is proposed. In order to locate the communities potentially belonging to the application-aware community organization, cohesive parts of a network backbone composed of nodes with similar concerned attributes are detected and set as the community seeds. The set of concerned attributes is set as the initial subspace for all community seeds. Then each community seed and its attribute subspace are adjusted iteratively to optimize the subspace fitness. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method and applications on real-world networks show its application values.",physics,physics.soc-ph,Polarization in the three-state $q$-voter model with anticonformity and bounded confidence,"Engaging with dissenting views, fostering productive disagreements or strategic anticonformity can benefit organizations as it challenges the status quo. The question arises, however, whether such strategic anticonformity ultimately leads to social polarization, which is not a desirable phenomenon. We address this question within an agent-based model of discrete choices. Using the way of modeling social responses in continuous opinion models, we propose a three-state $q$-voter model with anticonformity and bounded confidence. We analyze the model on a complete graph using the mean-field approach and Monte Carlo simulations. We show that strong polarization appears only for a small probability of anticonformity, which means that conformity combined with homophily enhances polarization. Our findings agree with results obtained previously in the group discussion experiment and within various continuous opinion models.",physics,physics.soc-ph,1
Kerr nonlinearity effect on light transmission in one dimensional photonic crystal,"We investigate numerically the effect of Kerr nonlinearity on the transmission spectrum of a one dimensional $\delta$-function photonic crystal. It is found that the photonic band gap (PBG) width either increases or decreases depending on both sign and strength of Kerr nonlinearity. We found that any amount of self-focusing nonlinearity $(\alpha >0)$ leads to an increase of the PBG width leading to light localization. However, for defocusing nonlinearity, we found a range of non-linearity strengths for which the photonic band gap width decreases when the nonlinearity strength increases and a critical non-linearity strength $|\alpha_{c}|$ above which the behaviour is reversed. At this critical value the photonic crystal become transparent and the photonic band gap is suppressed. We have also studied the dependence on the angle of incidence and polarization in the transmission spectrum of our one-dimensional photonic crystal. We found that the minimum of the transmission increases with incident angle but seems to be polarization-independent. We also found that position of the photonic band gap (PBG) shifts to lower wavelengths when the angle of incidence increases for TE mode while it shifts to longer wavelengths for TM mode.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,First principles design of Ohmic spin diodes based on quaternary Heusler compounds,"The Ohmic spin diode (OSD) is a recent concept in spintronics, which is based on half-metallic magnets (HMMs) and spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs). Quaternary Heusler compounds offer a unique platform to realize the OSD for room temperature applications as these materials possess very high Curie temperatures as well as half-metallic and spin-gapless semiconducting behavior within the same family. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function method we design four different OSDs based on half-metallic and spin-gapless semiconducting quaternary Heusler compounds. All four OSDs exhibit linear current-voltage ($I-V$) characteristics with zero threshold voltage $V_T$. We show that these OSDs possess a small leakage current, which stems from the overlap of the conduction and valence band edges of opposite spin channels around the Fermi level in the SGS electrodes. The obtained on/off current ratios vary between $30$ and $10^5$. Our results can pave the way for the experimental fabrication of the OSDs within the family of ordered quaternary Heusler compounds.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
"Axial Anomaly, Mismatched Fermi Surfaces and Vector Interaction in Dense Neutral Quark Matter","We report on effects of the q-$\bar{\rm q}$ vector interaction and/or the U(1)$_A$-anomaly-induced chiral-diquark coupling on the charge-neutral quark matter in $\beta$-equilibrium. We show that when the vector coupling is absent, there can appear a cross-over region sandwiched by two critical points in the intermediate temperature ($T$) region, while the phase transition in the low-$T$ region including zero temperature keeps being first order until the strength of the anomaly term is increased to have a critical value. On the other hand, when the vector coupling is also present, there appears a crossover region in the low-$T$ area including zero temperature with a new critical point, as was first demonstrated by Kitazawa et al and the present authors without and with the charge-neutral condition, respectively. We remark that the possible chromomagnetic instability is suppressed and can be even completely absent owing to the enhanced diquark coupling due to the anomaly term and/or by the vector interaction.",hep,hep-ph,On the bounds for the curvature and higher derivatives of the Isgur-Wise function,"We discuss constraints imposed on the zero-recoil curvature and higher derivatives of the Isgur-Wise function by a general quark model. These constraints are expressed as bounds for a given slope parameter, and compared with those based upon analyticity properties of QCD spectral functions. Our results also indicate that in the analysis of the experimental data for semileptonic $B\rar D^{(*)}$ decays it may be important to include at least the third term in the form factor expansion about the zero recoil point.",hep,hep-ph,1
Bootstrapping a Five-Loop Amplitude Using Steinmann Relations,"The analytic structure of scattering amplitudes is restricted by Steinmann relations, which enforce the vanishing of certain discontinuities of discontinuities. We show that these relations dramatically simplify the function space for the hexagon function bootstrap in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Armed with this simplification, along with the constraints of dual conformal symmetry and Regge exponentiation, we obtain the complete five-loop six-particle amplitude.",hep,hep-ph,Prospects and Problems of Tachyon Matter Cosmology,"We consider the evolution of FRW cosmological models and linear perturbations of tachyon matter rolling towards a minimum of its potential. The tachyon coupled to gravity is described by an effective 4d field theory of string theory tachyon. In the model where a tachyon potential $V(T)$ has a quadratic minimum at finite value of the tachyon field $T_0$ and $V(T_0)=0$, the tachyon condensate oscillates around its minimum with a decreasing amplitude. It is shown that its effective equation of state is $p=-\epsilon/3$. However, linear inhomogeneous tachyon fluctuations coupled to the oscillating background condensate are exponentially unstable due to the effect of parametric resonance. In another interesting model, where tachyon potential exponentially approaches zero at infinity of $T$, rolling tachyon condensate in an expanding universe behaves as pressureless fluid. Its linear fluctuations coupled with small metric perturbations evolve similar to these in the pressureless fluid. However, this linear stage changes to a strongly non-linear one very early, so that the usual quasi-linear stage observed at sufficiently large scales in the present Universe may not be realized in the absence of the usual particle-like cold dark matter.",hep,hep-ph,1
Relational evolution of effectively interacting GFT quantum gravity condensates,"We study the impact of effective interactions onto relationally evolving GFT condensates based on real-valued fields. In a first step we show that a free condensate configuration in an isotropic restriction settles dynamically into a low-spin configuration of the quantum geometry. This goes hand in hand with the accelerated and exponential expansion of its volume, as well as the vanishing of its relative uncertainty which suggests the classicalization of the quantum geometry. The dynamics of the emergent space can then be given in terms of the classical Friedmann equations. In contrast to models based on complex-valued fields, solutions avoiding the singularity problem can only be found if the initial conditions are appropriately chosen. We then turn to the analysis of the influence of effective interactions on the dynamics by studying in particular the Thomas-Fermi regime. In this context, at the cost of fine-tuning, an epoch of inflationary expansion of quantum geometric origin can be implemented. Finally, and for the first time, we study anisotropic GFT condensate configurations and show that such systems tend to isotropize quickly as the value of the relational clock grows. This paves the way to a more systematic investigation of anisotropies in the context of GFT condensate cosmology.",hep,hep-th,"R-symmetry breaking, runaway directions and global symmetries in O'Raifeartaigh models","We discuss O'Raifeartaigh models with general R-charge assignments, introduced by Shih to break R-symmetry spontaneously. We argue that most of these models have runaway directions related to the R-symmetry. In addition, we study the simplest model with a U(N) global symmetry and show that in a range of parameters R-symmetry is spontaneously broken in a metastable vacuum.",hep,hep-th,1
Linear Spin Wave Analysis for General Magnetic Orders in the Kondo Lattice Model,"We extend the formulation of the spin wave theory for the Kondo lattice model, which was mainly used for the ferromagnetic metallic state, to general magnetic orders including complex noncollinear and noncoplanar orders. The 1/S expansion is reformulated in the matrix form depending on the size of the magnetic unit cell. The noncollinearity and noncoplanarity of the localized moments are properly taken into account by the matrix elements of the para-unitary matrix used in the diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes type Hamiltonian for magnons. We apply the formulation within the linear spin wave approximation to a typical noncollinear case, the $120^{\circ}$ N{\'e}el order on a triangular lattice at half filling. We calculate the magnon excitation spectrum and the quantum correction to the magnitude of ordered moments as functions of the strength of the Hund's-rule coupling, $J_{\rm H}/t$. We find that the magnon excitation shows softening at $J_{\rm H}/t \simeq 2.9$, which indicates that the $120^{\circ}$ order is destabilized for smaller $J_{\rm H}/t$. On the other hand, we show that the $120^{\circ}$ order is stable in the entire range of $J_{\rm H}/t \gtrsim 2.9$, and, in the limit of $J_{\rm H}/t \to \infty$, the form of the spin wave spectrum approaches that for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, while the bandwidth is proportional to $t^2/J_{\rm H}$. The reduction of the ordered moment is smaller than that for the spin-only model, except in the vicinity of the softening.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Decision making by Berry's flux,"Order by disorder is a decision making process for frustrated systems but often leads to simple answers. We study order by disorder in the kagome Kondo model known for its complexity seeking rich decision making capabilities. At half filling and large Kondo coupling to hopping ratio $J_K/t$, the full manifold of 120$^o$ kagome ground states are degenerate at second order in $t/J_K$. We show this degeneracy lifts at sixth order when a fermion can hop around a hexagon and feel the Berry flux induced by a given spin texture. Using Monte-Carlo we then seek the ground state of this sixth order Hamiltonian and find in a 4x4 unit cell system that a co-planar 2x4 unit cell order is selected over the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$, $q=0$ and cuboc1 states, a result that survives even in the thermodynamic limit. This state is selected for its SU(2) flux properties induced by the spin texture and is analogous to the integer quantum Hall effect. Given the existence of numerous quantum Hall plateaus in other systems, the existence of this 2x4 unit cell state suggests that complex decision making is possible on the manifold of 120$^o$ states and achievable in different kagome-Kondo models.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Simultaneous X-ray and Radio Observations of Rotating Radio Transient J1819-1458,"We present the results of simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of PSR J1819-1458. Our 94-ks XMM-Newton observation of the high magnetic field 5*10^13 G pulsar reveals a blackbody spectrum (kT~130 eV) with a broad absorption feature, possibly composed of two lines at ~1.0 and ~1.3 keV. We performed a correlation analysis of the X-ray photons with radio pulses detected in 16.2 hours of simultaneous observations at 1-2 GHz with the Green Bank, Effelsberg, and Parkes telescopes, respectively. Both the detected X-ray photons and radio pulses appear to be randomly distributed in time. We find tentative evidence for a correlation between the detected radio pulses and X-ray photons on timescales of less than 10 pulsar spin periods, with the probability of this occurring by chance being 0.46%. This suggests that the physical process producing the radio pulses may also heat the polar-cap.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Afterglow of binary neutron star merger,"The merger of two neutron stars results often in a rapidly and differentially rotating hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). We show by numerical-relativity simulation that the magnetic-field profile around such HMNS is dynamically varied during its subsequent evolution, and as a result, electromagnetic radiation with a large luminosity ~ 0.1 B^2 R^3 Omega is emitted with baryon (B, R, and Omega are poloidal magnetic-field strength at stellar surface, stellar radius, and angular velocity of a HMNS). The predicted luminosity of electromagnetic radiation, which is primarily emitted along the magnetic-dipole direction, is ~ 10^{47} (B/10^{13} G)^2(R/10 km)^3(Omega/10^4 rad/s) ergs/s, that is comparable to the luminosity of quasars.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,1
Results from the Atacama B-mode Search (ABS) Experiment,"The Atacama B-mode Search (ABS) is an experiment designed to measure cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization at large angular scales ($\ell>40$). It operated from the ACT site at 5190~m elevation in northern Chile at 145 GHz with a net sensitivity (NEQ) of 41 $\mu$K$\sqrt{\rm s}$. It employed an ambient-temperature sapphire half-wave plate rotating at 2.55 Hz to modulate the incident polarization signal and reduce systematic effects. We report here on the analysis of data from a 2400 deg$^2$ patch of sky centered at declination $-42^\circ$ and right ascension $25^\circ$. We perform a blind analysis. After unblinding, we find agreement with the Planck TE and EE measurements on the same region of sky. We marginally detect polarized dust emission and give an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r<2.3$ (95% cl) with the equivalent of 100 on-sky days of observation. We also present a new measurement of the polarization of Tau A and introduce new methods associated with HWP-based observations.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,Supercal: Cross-Calibration of Multiple Photometric Systems to Improve Cosmological Measurements with Type Ia Supernovae,"Current cosmological analyses which use Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations combine SN samples to expand the redshift range beyond that of a single sample and increase the overall sample size. The inhomogeneous photometric calibration between different SN samples is one of the largest systematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. To place these different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observations of a small sample of very bright flux standards on the $HST$ system. We propose a complementary method, called `Supercal', in which we use measurements of secondary standards in each system, compare these to measurements of the same stars in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) system, and determine offsets for each system relative to PS1, placing all SN observations on a single, consistent photometric system. PS1 has observed $3\pi$ of the sky and has a relative calibration of better than 5 mmag (for $\sim15<griz<21$ mag), making it an ideal reference system. We use this process to recalibrate optical observations taken by the following SN samples: PS1, SNLS, SDSS, CSP, and CfA1-4. We measure discrepancies on average of 10 mmag, but up to 35 mmag, in various optical passbands. We find that correcting for these differences changes recovered values for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, by on average $2.6\%$. This change is roughly half the size of current statistical constraints on $w$. The size of this effect strongly depends on the error in the $B-V$ calibration of the low-$z$ surveys. The Supercal method will allow future analyses to tie past samples to the best calibrated sample.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,1
Microscopic Property of Amorphous Semiconductor Metal Oxide InGaZnO$_{4}$ and Role of O-deficiency,"We investigated the microscopic and electronic structures amorphous oxide semiconductors InGaZnO$_{4}$ (a-IGZO) and the role of O-deficiency through the first-principle calculations. The structure of the amorphous oxide is complicated by the admixture of many different kinds of substructures, however it is surprisingly found that the band tail states, which are well-known to be present in the amorphous semiconductors, are few generated for the conduction band minimum (CBM). The electronic structure around CBM is little affected by the disorder and also by the O-deficiency. Free electron carriers can be generated without a creation of donor-level in the O-deficient amorphous oxide.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,Spatial Correlation at the Boson Peak Frequency in Amorphous Materials,"The Boson peak (BP), an excess of vibrational density of states, is ubiquitous for amorphous materials and is believed to hold the key to understanding the dynamics of glass and glass transition. Previous studies have established an energy scale for the BP, which is ~1-10 meV or ~THz in frequency. However, so far, little is known about the momentum dependence or spatial correlation of the BP. Here, we report the observation of the BP in model Zr-Cu-Al metallic glasses over a wide range of momentum transfer, using inelastic neutron scattering, heat capacity, Raman scattering measurements, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The BP energy is largely dispersionless; however, the BP intensity was found to scale with the static structure factor. Additional MD simulations with a generic Lennard-Jones potential confirmed the same. Based on these results, an analytical expression for the dynamic structure factor was formulated for the BP excitation. Further analysis of the simulated disordered structures suggests that the BP is related to local structure fluctuations (e.g., in shear strain). Our results offered insights into the nature of the BP and provide guidance for the development of theories of amorphous materials.",cond-mat,cond-mat.dis-nn,1
The BFKL Equation from the Wilson Renormalization Group,"We discuss the Wilson renormalization group approach to the effective action for low $x$ physics.

Comments on the nuclear symmetry energy,"According to standard textbooks, the nuclear symmetry energy originates from the {\it kinetic} energy and the {\it interaction} itself. We argue that this view requires certain modifications. We ascribe the physical origin of the {\it kinetic} term to the discreteness of fermionic levels of, in principle arbitrary binary fermionic systems, and relate its mean value directly to the average level density. Physically it connects this part also to the isoscalar part of the interaction which, at least in self-bound systems like atomic nuclei, decides upon the spatial dimensions of the system. For the general case of binary fermionic systems possible external confining potentials as well as specific boundary conditions will contribute to this part. The reliability of this concept is tested using self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculations.",nucl,nucl-th,"Comment on ""Direct Observation of Proton Emission in $^{11}$Be""","We argue that conclusions of [PRL 123, 082501 (2019)] are incorrect. The authors present the direct observation of beta-delayed proton emission in the beta decay of 11Be. From the determined branching ratio for this process and from the energy spectrum of emitted protons the existence of a so far unobserved narrow resonance in 11Be was deduced. The given beta strength for the transition to this state is however wrong. In addition, we show that the combination of peak position and branching ratio is in strong disagreement with models considered by the authors. Furthermore, we identify several deficiencies in the analysis, and we provide possible sources of background, that could explain the error.",nucl,nucl-th,1
The loop gravity string,"In this work we study canonical gravity in finite regions for which we introduce a generalisation of the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term including the Immirzi parameter. We study the canonical formulation on a spacelike hypersuface with a boundary sphere and show how the presence of this term leads to an unprecedented type of degrees of freedom coming from the restoration of the gauge and diffeomorphism symmetry at the boundary. In the presence of a loop quantum gravity state, these boundary degrees of freedom localize along a set of punctures on the boundary sphere. We demonstrate that these degrees of freedom are effectively described by auxiliary strings with a 3-dimensional internal target space attached to each puncture. We show that the string currents represent the local frame field, that the string angular momenta represent the area flux and that the string stress tensor represents the two dimensional metric on the boundary of the region of interest. Finally, we show that the commutators of these broken diffeomorphisms charges of quantum geometry satisfy at each puncture a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=3$. This leads to a description of the boundary degrees of freedom in terms of a CFT structure with central charge proportional to the number of loop punctures. The boundary $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is recovered via the action of the $U(1)^3$ Kac-Moody generators (associated with the string current) in a way that is the exact analog of an infinite dimensional generalization of the Schwinger spin-representation. We finally show that this symmetry is broken by the presence of background curvature.",hep,hep-th,$D=4$ supergravity from the Maxwell-Weyl superalgebra,"Abstract We present the construction of the first-order $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity action by gauging the Maxwell-Weyl superalgebra. The four-form lagrangian is constructed by using the curvatures of the algebra and the local scale invariance of the action is achieved through the introduction of a compensating scalar field. Finally, we find the generalized Einstein equation with a coordinate dependent cosmological term.",hep,hep-th,1
Full Electroresistance Modulation in a Mixed-Phase Metallic Alloy,"We report a giant, ~22%, electroresistance modulation for a metallic alloy above room temperature. It is achieved by a small electric field of 2 kV/cm via piezoelectric strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling and the resulting magnetic phase transition in epitaxial FeRh/BaTiO3 heterostructures. This work presents detailed experimental evidence for an isothermal magnetic phase transition driven by tetragonality modulation in FeRh thin films, which is in contrast to the large volume expansion in the conventional temperature-driven magnetic phase transition in FeRh. Moreover, all the experimental results in this work illustrate FeRh as a mixed-phase model system well similar to phase-separated colossal magnetoresistance systems with phase instability therein.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Mode-selective vibrational control of charge transport in $\pi$-conjugated molecular materials,"The soft character of organic materials leads to strong coupling between molecular nuclear and electronic dynamics. This coupling opens the way to control charge transport in organic electronic devices by inducing molecular vibrational motions. However, despite encouraging theoretical predictions, experimental realization of such control has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate experimentally that photoconductivity in a model organic optoelectronic device can be controlled by the selective excitation of molecular vibrations. Using an ultrafast infrared laser source to create a coherent superposition of vibrational motions in a pentacene/C60 photoresistor, we observe that excitation of certain modes in the 1500-1700 cm$^{-1}$ region leads to photocurrent enhancement. Excited vibrations affect predominantly trapped carriers. The effect depends on the nature of the vibration and its mode-specific character can be well described by the vibrational modulation of intermolecular electronic couplings. Vibrational control thus presents a new tool for studying electron-phonon coupling and charge dynamics in (bio)molecular materials.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,1
Generalized Skyrmions and hairy black holes in asymptotically AdS$_4$ spacetime,"We investigate the properties of spherically symmetric black hole solutions in the generalized Einstein-Skyrme model theory in four-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-time. The dependencies of the Skyrmion fields on the cosmological constant and on the strength of the effective gravitational coupling are examined. We show that the increase of the absolute value of the cosmological constant qualitatively yields the same effect as increasing of the effective gravitational coupling. We confirm that, similar to the model in the asymptotically flat space-time, a necessary condition for the existence of black holes with Skyrmionic hair is the inclusion of the Skyrme term.",hep,hep-th,Remarks on Entanglement for Fuzzy Geometry and Gravity,"We consider defining a fuzzy space by a specific state in a fermionic field theory in terms of which all the observables for the space can be evaluated. This allows for a definition of entanglement for a fuzzy space by direct integration of the fields over a certain region. Even though the resulting formula for the entanglement entropy (EE) is similar to what has been used in the quantum Hall effect, our derivation provides a novel perspective. We also review and strengthen the arguments for the EE to be described by a generalized Chern-Simons form.",hep,hep-th,1
No correlation of the Lyman continuum escape fraction with spectral hardness,"The properties that govern the production and escape of hydrogen ionizing photons (Lyman continuum, LyC; with energies >13.6 eV) in star-forming galaxies are still poorly understood, but they are key to identifying and characterizing the sources that reionized the Universe. Here we empirically explore the relationship between the hardness of ionizing radiation and the LyC leakage in a large sample of low-$z$ star-forming galaxies from the recent Hubble Space Telescope Low-$z$ Lyman Continuum Survey. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey stacks and deep XShooter observations, we investigate the hardness of the ionizing spectra ($Q_{\rm He^+}/Q_{\rm H}$) between 54.4 eV (He$^{+}$) and 13.6 eV (H) from the optical recombination lines HeII 4686A and H$\beta$ 4861A for galaxies with LyC escape fractions spanning a wide range, $f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC) \simeq 0 - 90\%$. We find that the observed intensity of HeII/H$\beta$ is primarily driven by variations in the metallicity, but is not correlated with LyC leakage. Both very strong ($<f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC)> \simeq 0.5$) and nonleakers ($ < f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC) > \simeq 0$) present similar observed intensities of HeII/H$\beta$ at comparable metallicity, between $\simeq 0.01$ and $\simeq 0.02$ for $12 + \log({\rm O/H}) > 8.0$ and $<8.0$, respectively. Our results demonstrate that $Q_{\rm He^+}/Q_{\rm H}$ does not correlate with $f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC)$, which implies that strong LyC emitters do not show harder ionizing spectra than nonleakers at similar metallicity.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,Detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the vicinity of PSR B1706-44 with H.E.S.S,"The energetic pulsar PSR B1706-44 and the adjacent supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G 343.1-2.3 were observed by H.E.S.S. during a dedicated observational campaign in 2007. A new source of very-high-energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission, HESS J1708-443, was discovered with its centroid at RA(J2000) = 17h08m10s and Dec(J2000) = -44d21', with a statistical error of 3 arcmin on each axis. The VHE gamma-ray source is significantly more extended than the H.E.S.S. point-spread function, with an intrinsic Gaussian width of 0.29 +/- 0.04 deg. Its energy spectrum can be described by a power law with a photon index Gamma = 2.0 +/- 0.1 (stat) +/- 0.2 (sys).

Supersymmetric A_4 X Z_3 and A_4 Realizations of Neutrino Tribimaximal Mixing Without and With Corrections,"In an improved application of the tetrahedral symmetry A_4 first introduced by Ma and Rajasekaran, supplemented by the discrete symmetry Z_3 as well as supersymmetry, a two-parameter form of the neutrino mass matrix is derived which exhibits the tribimaximal mixing of Harrison, Perkins, and Scott. This form is the same one obtained previously by Altarelli and Feruglio, and the inverse of that obtained by Babu and He. If only A_4 is used, then corrections appear, making tan^2(theta_{12}) differenet from 0.5, without changing significantly sin^2(2 theta_{23}) from one or theta_{13} from zero.",hep,hep-ph,A two-component model for $\gamma^*$-p scattering at small Bjorken x,"We extend the Golec-Biernat-W\""usthoff model for virtual photon - proton scattering to include the resolved photon component explicitly.

Dynamical Interactions Make Hot Jupiters in Open Star Clusters,"Explaining the origin and evolution of exoplanetary ""hot Jupiters"" remains a significant challenge. One possible mechanism for their production is planet-planet interactions, which produces hot Jupiters from planets born far from their host stars but near their dynamical stability limits. In the much more likely case of planets born far from their dynamical stability limits, can hot Jupiters can be formed in star clusters? Our N-body simulations of planetary systems inside star clusters answer this question in the affirmative, and show that hot Jupiter formation is not a rare event. We detail three case studies of the dynamics-induced births of hot Jupiters on highly eccentric orbits that can only occur inside star clusters. The hot Jupiters' orbits bear remarkable similarities to those of some of the most extreme exoplanets known: HAT-P-32 b, HAT-P-2 b, HD 80606 b and GJ 876 d. If stellar perturbations formed these hot Jupiters then our simulations predict that these very hot, inner planets are often accompanied by much more distant gas giants in highly eccentric orbits.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,The SOPHIE search for northern extrasolar planets XIII.

Both stars were observed in the context of the SOPHIE exoplanet consortium's dedicated M-dwarf subprogramme, which aims to detect exoplanets around nearby M-dwarf stars through a systematic survey. For Gl96, we present the discovery of a new exoplanet at 73.9 d with a minimum mass of 19.66 earth masses. Gl96 b has an eccentricity of 0.44, placing it among the most eccentric planets orbiting M stars. For Gl617A we independently confirm a recently reported exoplanet at 86.7 d with a minimum mass of 31.29 earth masses. Both Gl96 b and Gl617A b are potentially within the habitable zone, though Gl96 b's high eccentricity may take it too close to the star at periapsis.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,1
Scalar Dark Matter Candidates -- Revisited,"We revisit the possibility of light scalar dark matter, in the MeV to GeV mass bracket and coupled to electrons through fermion or vector mediators, in light of significant experimental and observational advances that probe new physics below the GeV-scale. We establish new limits from electron colliders and fixed-target beams, and derive the strength of loop-induced processes that are probed by precision physics, among other laboratory probes. In addition, we compute the cooling bound from SN1987A, consider self-scattering, structure formation, and cosmological constraints as well as the limits from dark matter-electron scattering in direct detection experiments. We then show that the combination of constraints largely excludes the possibility that the galactic annihilation of these particles may explain the long-standing INTEGRAL excess of 511 keV photons as observed in the galactic bulge. As caveat to these conclusions we identify the resonant annihilation regime where the vector mediator goes nearly on-shell.",hep,hep-ph,Heavy quarkonia,"Two complementary approaches to the theory of heavy quarkonia are discussed.

Improved constraints on $\gamma$: CKM2014 update,"I report on an updated combination of all currently available tree-level measurements of the CKM angle $\gamma$ from LHCb. This combination currently gives LHCb's most precise value of $\gamma = (73^{+9}_{-10})^\circ$ obtained from $B\to DK$-like decays. For the first time in a single experiment, the uncertainty has dropped below $10^\circ$. When using $B\to D\pi$ decays in addition, the situation becomes more difficult to interpret.",hep,hep-ex,Signal Processing in the MicroBooNE LArTPC,"The MicroBooNE experiment is designed to observe interactions of neutrinos with a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector from the on-axis Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) and off-axis Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The detector consists of a $2.5~m\times 2.3~m\times 10.4~m$ TPC including an array of 32 PMTs used for triggering and timing purposes. The TPC is housed in an evacuable and foam insulated cryostat vessel. It has a 2.5 m drift length in a uniform field up to 500 V/cm. There are 3 readout wire planes (U, V and Y co-ordinates) with a 3-mm wire pitch for a total of 8,256 signal channels. The fiducial mass of the detector is 60 metric tons of LAr. In a LArTPC, ionization electrons from a charged particle track drift along the electric field lines to the detection wire planes inducing bipolar signals on the U and V (induction) planes, and a unipolar signal collected on the (collection) Y plane. The raw wire signals are processed by specialized low-noise front-end readout electronics immersed in LAr which shape and amplify the signal. Further signal processing and digitization is carried out by warm electronics. We present the techniques by which the observed final digitized waveforms, which comprise the original ionization signal convoluted with detector field response and electronics response as well as noise, are processed to recover the original ionization signal in charge and time. The correct modeling of these ingredients is critical for further event reconstruction in LArTPCs.",hep,hep-ex,1
"A classical, non-singular, bouncing universe","We present a model for a classical, non-singular bouncing cosmology without violation of the null energy condition (NEC). The field content is General Relativity plus a real scalar field with a canonical kinetic term and only renormalizable, polynomial type self-interaction for the scalar field in the Jordan frame. The universe begins vacuum-energy dominated and is contracting at $t=-\infty$. We consider a closed universe with a positive spatial curvature, which is responsible for the universe bouncing without any NEC violation. An $R\phi^2$ coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field drives the scalar from the initial false vacuum to the true vacuum during the bounce. The model is sub-Planckian throughout its evolution and every dimensionful parameter is below the effective field theory scale $M_P$, so we expect no ghost-type or tachyonic instabilities. This model solves the horizon problem and extends co-moving particle geodesics to past infinity, resulting in a geodesically complete universe without singularities. We solve the Friedman equations and the scalar field equation of motion numerically, and analytically under certain approximations.",hep,hep-th,Holographic Lifshitz flows and the null energy condition,"We study asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes and the constraints on flows between Lifshitz fixed points imposed by the null energy condition. In contrast with the relativistic holographic c-theorem, where the effective AdS radius, L, is monotonically decreasing in the IR, for Lifshitz backgrounds we find that both L and z may flow in either direction. We demonstrate this with several numerical examples in a phenomenological model with a massive gauge field coupled to a real scalar.",hep,hep-th,1
Structure of light and heavy pentaquarks,Light and heavy pentaquarks are described within a constituent quark model based on a spin-flavor hyperfine interaction. In this model the lowest state acquires positive parity. The masses of the light antidecuplet members are calculated dynamically using a variational method. It is shown that the octet and antidecuplet states with the same quantum numbers mix ideally due to SU(3)$_F$ breaking. Masses of the charmed antisextet pentaquarks are predicted within the same model.,hep,hep-ph,A General Analysis of $\gamma$ Determinations from $B\to\pi K$ Decays,"We present a general parametrization of $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm K, \pi^0K^\pm$ and $B_d\to\pi^0 K, \pi^\mp K^\pm$ decays, taking into account both electroweak penguin and rescattering effects. This formalism allows -- among other things -- an improved implementation of the strategies that were recently proposed by Neubert and Rosner to probe the CKM angle $\gamma$ with the help of $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm K, \pi^0K^\pm$ decays. In particular, it allows us to investigate the sensitivity of the extracted value of $\gamma$ to the basic assumptions of their approach. We find that certain SU(3)-breaking effects may have an important impact and emphasize that additional hadronic uncertainties are due to rescattering processes. The latter can be controlled by using SU(3) flavour symmetry arguments and additional experimental information provided by $B^\pm\to K^\pm K$ modes. We propose a new strategy to probe the angle $\gamma$ with the help of the neutral decays $B_d\to\pi^0 K, \pi^\mp K^\pm$, which is theoretically cleaner than the $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm K, \pi^0K^\pm$ approach. Here rescattering processes can be taken into account by just measuring the CP-violating observables of the decay $B_d\to\pi^0K_{\rm S}$. Finally, we point out that an experimental analysis of $B_s\to K^+K^-$ modes would also be very useful to probe the CKM angle $\gamma$, as well as electroweak penguins, and we critically compare the virtues and weaknesses of the various approaches discussed in this paper. As a by-product, we point out a strategy to include the electroweak penguins in the determination of the CKM angle $\alpha$ from $B\to\pi\pi$ decays.",hep,hep-ph,1
Symmetry breaking in commensurate graphene rotational stacking; a comparison of theory and experiment,"Graphene stacked in a Bernal configuration (60 degrees relative rotations between sheets) differs electronically from isolated graphene due to the broken symmetry introduced by interlayer bonds forming between only one of the two graphene unit cell atoms. A variety of experiments have shown that non-Bernal rotations restore this broken symmetry; consequently, these stacking varieties have been the subject of intensive theoretical interest. Most theories predict substantial changes in the band structure ranging from the development of a Van Hove singularity and an angle dependent electron localization that causes the Fermi velocity to go to zero as the relative rotation angle between sheets goes to zero. In this work we show by direct measurement that non-Bernal rotations preserve the graphene symmetry with only a small perturbation due to weak effective interlayer coupling. We detect neither a Van Hove singularity nor any significant change in the Fermi velocity. These results suggest significant problems in our current theoretical understanding of the origins of the band structure of this material.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Electronic structure of few-layer black phosphorus from $\mu$-ARPES,"Black phosphorus (BP) stands out among two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors because of its high mobility and thickness dependent direct band gap. However, the quasiparticle band structure of ultrathin BP has remained inaccessible to experiment thus far. Here we use a recently developed laser-based micro-focus angle resolved photoemission ($\mu$-ARPES) system to establish the electronic structure of 2-9 layer BP from experiment. Our measurements unveil ladders of anisotropic, quantized subbands at energies that deviate from the scaling observed in conventional semiconductor quantum wells. We quantify the anisotropy of the effective masses and determine universal tight-binding parameters which provide an accurate description of the electronic structure for all thicknesses.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Covariant conserved currents for scalar-tensor Horndeski theory,"The scalar-tensor theories have become popular recently in particular in connection with attempts to explain present accelerated expansion of the universe, but they have been considered as a natural extension of general relativity long time ago. The Horndeski scalar-tensor theory involving four invariantly defined Lagrangians is a natural choice since it implies field equations involving at most second derivatives. Following the formalisms of defining covariant global quantities and conservation laws for perturbations of spacetimes in standard general relativity we extend these methods to the general Horndeski theory and find the covariant conserved currents for all four Lagrangians. The current is also constructed in the case of linear perturbations involving both metric and scalar field. As a specific illustration we derive a superpotential which leads to the covariantly conserved current in the Branse-Dicke theory.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,The large-separation expansion of peak clustering in Gaussian random fields,"In the peaks approach, the formation sites of observable structures in the Universe are identified as peaks in the matter density field. The statistical properties of the clustering of peaks are particularly important in this respect. In this paper, we investigate the large-separation expansion of the correlation function of peaks in Gaussian random fields. The analytic formula up to third order is derived, and the resultant expression can be evaluated by a combination of one-dimensional fast Fourier transforms, which are evaluated very fast. The analytic formula obtained perturbatively in the large-separation limit is compared with a method of Monte-Carlo integrations, and a complementarity between the two methods is demonstrated.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1

Since these fractional excitations could be utilized for quantum computing, how to create, observe, and control them through the spin degree of freedom is a central issue. Here, we study dynamical spin transport in a wide range of frequency for the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, by applying an AC magnetic field to an edge of the system. We find that, in the Kitaev QSL phase, spin polarizations at the other edge are resonantly induced in a specific spin component, even though the static spin correlations are vanishingly small. This interedge spin resonance appears around the input frequency over the broad frequency range. Comparing with the dynamical spin correlations, we clarify that the resonance is governed by the itinerant Majorana fermions with a broad continuum excitation spectrum, which can propagate over long distances, although it vanishes for the pure Kitaev model because of accidental degeneracy and requires weak Heisenberg interactions. We also find that the spin polarizations in the other spin components are weakly induced at an almost constant frequency close to the excitation gap of the localized fluxes, irrespective of the input frequency. These results demonstrate that the dynamical spin transport is a powerful probe of the fractional excitations in the Kitaev QSL. Possible experimental realization of the interedge spin resonance is discussed.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Modeling tissue perfusion in terms of 1d-3d embedded mixed-dimension coupled problems with distributed sources,"We present a new method for modeling tissue perfusion on the capillary scale. The microvasculature is represented by a network of one-dimensional vessel segments embedded in the extra-vascular space. Vascular and extra-vascular space exchange fluid over the vessel walls. This exchange is modeled by distributed sources using smooth kernel functions for the extra-vascular domain. It is shown that the proposed method may significantly improve the approximation of the exchange flux, in comparison with existing methods for mixed-dimension embedded problems. Furthermore, the method exhibits better convergence rates of the relevant quantities due to the increased regularity of the extra-vascular pressure solution. Numerical experiments with a vascular network from the rat cortex show that the error in the approximation of the exchange flux for coarse grid resolution may be decreased by a factor of $3$. This may open the way for computing on larger network domains, where a fine grid resolution cannot be achieved in practical simulations due to constraints in computational resources, for example in the context of uncertainty quantification.",physics,physics.comp-ph,Electron-phonon coupling and hot electron thermalization in titanium nitride,"We have studied the thermalization of hot carriers in both pristine and defective titanium nitride (TiN) using a two-temperature model. All parameters of this model, including the electron-phonon coupling parameter, were obtained from first-principles density-functional theory calculations. The virtual crystal approximation was used to describe defective systems. We find that thermalization of hot carriers occurs on much faster time scales than in gold as a consequence of the significantly stronger electron-phonon coupling in TiN. Specifically, the largest thermalization times, on the order of 200 femtoseconds, are found in TiN with nitrogen vacancies for electron temperatures around 4000 K.",physics,physics.comp-ph,1
VLBI imaging of M81* at 3.4 mm with source-frequency phase-referencing,"We report on the first VLBI image of the M81 nucleus (M81*) at a wavelength of 3.4 mm, obtained with the source-frequency phase-referencing (SFPR) technique. Thanks to the SFPR calibration, the coherent integration time could be eventually increased by more than an order of magnitude, which enabled the detection of fringes at the level of 45 mJy beam-1 with a dynamic range higher than 130:1. This paves the way toward future mm/sub-mm VLBI observations of weaker sources. From the analysis of the M81* visibilities, a core size of ~50 uas at 3.4 mm was estimated. This follows the power-law relationship with wavelength lambda^0.88, reported previously at lower frequencies.

The spectra were obtained with the Keck 10-meter telescope, including light coming from within 0.5 arcsec of the star, corresponding typically to within a few to tens of au of the star, and covering nearly the entire visible wavelength range from 3640 to 7890 angstroms. We establish detection thresholds by injecting synthetic laser emission lines into our spectra and blindly analyzing them for detections. We compute flux density detection thresholds for all wavelengths and spectral types sampled. Our detection thresholds for the power of the lasers themselves range from 3 kW to 13 MW, independent of distance to the star but dependent on the competing ""glare"" of the spectral energy distribution of the star and on the wavelength of the laser light, launched from a benchmark, diffraction-limited 10-meter class telescope. We found no such laser emission coming from the planetary region around any of the 5600 stars. As they contain roughly 2000 lukewarm, Earth-size planets, we rule out models of the Milky Way in which over 0.1 percent of warm, Earth-size planets harbor technological civilizations that, intentionally or not, are beaming optical lasers toward us.

Universal zero-bias conductance for the single electron transistor. II: Comparison with numerical results,"A numerical renormalization-group survey of the zero-bias electrical conductance through a quantum dot embedded in the conduction path of a nanodevice is reported. The results are examined in the light of a recently derived linear mapping between the temperature-dependent conductance and the universal function describing the conductance for the symmetric Anderson model. A gate potential applied to the conduction electrons is known to change markedly the transport properties of a quantum dot side-coupled to the conduction path; in the embedded geometry here discussed, a similar potential is shown to affect only quantitatively the temperature dependence of the conductance. As expected, in the Kondo regime the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the mapped conductances. In the mixed-valence regime, the mapping describes accurately the low-temperature tail of the conductance. The mapping is shown to provide a unified view of conduction in the single-electron transistor.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Creep of Chiral Domain Walls,"Recent experimental studies of magnetic domain expansion under easy-axis drive fields in materials with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have shown that the domain wall velocity is asymmetric as a function of an external in plane magnetic field. This is understood as a consequence of the inversion asymmetry of the system, yielding a finite chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Numerous attempts have been made to explain these observations using creep theory, but, in doing so, these have not included all contributions to the domain wall energy or have introduced additional free parameters. In this article we present a theory for creep motion of chiral domain walls in the creep regime that includes the most important contributions to the domain-wall energy and does not introduce new free parameters beyond the usual parameters that are included in the micromagnetic energy. Furthermore, we present experimental measurements of domain wall velocities as a function of in-plane field that are well decribed by our model, and from which material properties such as the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the demagnetization field are extracted.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to image one primary beam area at 3 GHz with 8 arcsec FWHM resolution and 1.0 microJy/beam rms noise near the pointing center. The P(D) distribution from the central 10 arcmin of this confusion-limited image constrains the count of discrete sources in the 1 < S(microJy/beam) < 10 range. At this level the brightness-weighted differential count S^2 n(S) is converging rapidly, as predicted by evolutionary models in which the faintest radio sources are star-forming galaxies; and ~96$% of the background originating in galaxies has been resolved into discrete sources. About 63% of the radio background is produced by AGNs, and the remaining 37% comes from star-forming galaxies that obey the far-infrared (FIR) / radio correlation and account for most of the FIR background at lambda = 160 microns. Our new data confirm that radio sources powered by AGNs and star formation evolve at about the same rate, a result consistent with AGN feedback and the rough correlation of black hole and bulge stellar masses. The confusion at centimeter wavelengths is low enough that neither the planned SKA nor its pathfinder ASKAP EMU survey should be confusion limited, and the ultimate source detection limit imposed by ""natural"" confusion is < 0.01 microJy at 1.4 GHz. If discrete sources dominate the bright extragalactic background reported by ARCADE2 at 3.3 GHz, they cannot be located in or near galaxies and most are < 0.03 microJy at 1.4 GHz.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Using the Dipolar and Quadrupolar Moments to Improve Solar-Cycle Predictions Based on the Polar Magnetic Fields,"The solar cycle and its associated magnetic activity are the main drivers behind changes in the interplanetary environment and Earth's upper atmosphere (commonly referred to as space weather and climate). In recent years there has been an effort to develop accurate solar cycle predictions, leading to nearly a hundred widely spread predictions for the amplitude of solar cycle 24. Here we show that cycle predictions can be made more accurate if performed separately for each hemisphere, taking advantage of information about both the dipolar and quadrupolar moments of the solar magnetic field during minimum.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Ultra-Wideband Detection of 22 Coherent Radio Bursts on M Dwarfs,"Coherent radio bursts detected from M dwarfs have some analogy with solar radio bursts, but reach orders of magnitude higher luminosities. These events trace particle acceleration, powered by magnetic reconnection, shock fronts (such as formed by coronal mass ejections, CMEs), and magnetospheric currents, in some cases offering the only window into these processes in stellar atmospheres. We conducted a 58-hour, ultra-wideband survey for coherent radio bursts on 5 active M dwarfs. We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to observe simultaneously in three frequency bands covering a subset of 224-482 MHz and 1-6 GHz, achieving the widest fractional bandwidth to date for any observations of stellar radio bursts. We detected 22 bursts across 13 epochs, providing the first large sample of wideband dynamic spectra of stellar coherent radio bursts. The observed bursts have diverse morphology, with durations ranging from seconds to hours, but all share strong (40-100%) circular polarization. No events resemble solar Type II bursts (often associated with CMEs), but we cannot rule out the occurrence of radio-quiet stellar CMEs. The hours-long bursts are all polarized in the sense of the x-mode of the star's large-scale magnetic field, suggesting they are cyclotron maser emission from electrons accelerated in the large-scale field, analogous to auroral processes on ultracool dwarfs. The duty cycle of luminous coherent bursts peaks at 25% at 1-1.4 GHz, declining at lower and higher frequencies, indicating source regions in the low corona. At these frequencies, active M dwarfs should be the most common galactic transient source.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Simulations of the Microwave Sky,"We create realistic, full-sky, half-arcminute resolution simulations of the microwave sky matched to the most recent astrophysical observations. The primary purpose of these simulations is to test the data reduction pipeline for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) experiment; however, we have widened the frequency coverage beyond the ACT bands to make these simulations applicable to other microwave background experiments. Some of the novel features of these simulations are that the radio and infrared galaxy populations are correlated with the galaxy cluster populations, the CMB is lensed by the dark matter structure in the simulation via a ray-tracing code, the contribution to the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signals from galaxy clusters, groups, and the IGM has been included, and the gas prescription to model the SZ signals matches the most recent X-ray observations. Regarding the contamination of cluster SZ flux by radio galaxies, we find for 148 GHz (90 GHz) only 3% (4%) of halos have their SZ decrements contaminated at a level of 20% or more. We find the contamination levels higher for infrared galaxies. However, at 90 GHz, less than 20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<1.2 have their SZ decrements filled in at a level of 20% or more. At 148 GHz, less than 20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<0.8 have their SZ decrements filled in at a level of 50% or larger. Our models also suggest that a population of very high flux infrared galaxies, which are likely lensed sources, contribute most to the SZ contamination of very massive clusters at 90 and 148 GHz. These simulations are publicly available and should serve as a useful tool for microwave surveys to cross-check SZ cluster detection, power spectrum, and cross-correlation analyses.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Rotation curve decompositions with Gaussian Processes: taking into account data correlations leads to unbiased results,Correlations between velocity measurements in disk galaxy rotation curves are usually neglected when fitting dynamical models. Here I show how data correlations can be taken into account in rotation curve decompositions using Gaussian Processes. I find that marginalizing over correlation parameters proves critical to obtain unbiased estimates of the luminous and dark matter distributions in galaxies.,astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
The strongest bounds on active-sterile neutrino mixing after Planck data,"Light sterile neutrinos can be excited by oscillations with active neutrinos in the early universe. Their properties can be constrained by their contribution as extra-radiation, parameterized in terms of the effective number of neutrino species N_ eff, and to the universe energy density today \Omega_\nu h^2. Both these parameters have been measured to quite a good precision by the Planck satellite experiment. We use this result to update the bounds on the parameter space of (3+1) sterile neutrino scenarios, with an active-sterile neutrino mass squared splitting in the range (10^{-5} - 10^2 ) eV^2. We consider both normal and inverted mass orderings for the active and sterile states. For the first time we take into account the possibility of two non-vanishing active-sterile mixing angles. We find that the bounds are more stringent than those obtained in laboratory experiments. This leads to a strong tension with the short-baseline hints of light sterile neutrinos. In order to relieve this disagreement, modifications of the standard cosmological scenario, e.g. large primordial neutrino asymmetries, are required.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Multiple Soft Limits of Cosmological Correlation Functions,"We derive novel identities satisfied by inflationary correlation functions in the limit where two external momenta are taken to be small. We derive these statements in two ways: using background-wave arguments and as Ward identities following from the fixed-time path integral. Interestingly, these identities allow us to constrain some of the O(q^2) components of the soft limit, in contrast to their single-soft analogues. We provide several nontrivial checks of our identities both in the context of resonant non-Gaussianities and in small sound speed models. Additionally, we extend the relation at lowest order in external momenta to arbitrarily many soft legs, and comment on the many-soft extension at higher orders in the soft momentum. Finally, we consider how higher soft limits lead to identities satisfied by correlation functions in large-scale structure.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Quasifission dynamics in TDHF,"For light and medium mass systems the capture cross-section may be considered to be the same as that for complete fusion, whereas for heavy systems leading to superheavy formations the evaporation residue cross-section is dramatically reduced due to the quasifission (QF) and fusion-fission processes thus making the capture cross-section to be essentially the sum of these two cross-sections, with QF occurring at a much shorter time-scale. Consequently, quasifission is the primary reaction mechanism that limits the formation of superheavy nuclei. Within the last few years the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) approach has been utilized for studying the dynamics of quasifission. The study of quasifission is showing a great promise to provide insight based on very favorable comparisons with experimental data. In this article we will focus on the TDHF calculations of quasifission observables for the $^{48}$Ca+$^{249}$Bk system.",nucl,nucl-th,Probing universal dynamics with topological data analysis in a gluonic plasma,"We study nonequilibrium dynamics of SU(2) lattice gauge theory in Minkowski space-time in a classical-statistical regime, where characteristic gluon occupancies are much larger than unity. In this strongly correlated system far from equilibrium, the correlations of energy and topological densities show self-similar behavior related to a turbulent cascade towards higher momentum scales. We employ persistent homology to infer topological features of the gluonic plasma via a hierarchy of simplicial and cubical complexes. All topological observables under investigation are also manifestly gauge invariant and are shown to exhibit self-similar evolution, which relate the spatial and temporal properties of the plasma in terms of universal scaling exponents and functions. The findings may help to understand the early stages of heavy-ion collisions in the limit of high energies, and our methods can also facilitate the topological analysis of other complex systems such as encountered in experiments with ultracold quantum gases.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Pulsar timing can constrain primordial black holes in the LIGO mass window,"The recent discovery of gravitational waves from merging black holes has generated interest in primordial black holes as a possible component of the dark matter. In this paper, we show that pulsar timing may soon have sufficient data to constrain $1$-$1000\,M_{\odot}$ primordial black holes via the non-detection of a third-order Shapiro time delay as the black holes move around the Galactic halo. We present the results of a Monte Carlo simulation which suggests that future data from known pulsars may be capable of constraining the PBH density more stringently than other existing methods in the mass range ~1-30$\,M_{\odot}$. We find that timing new pulsars discovered using the proposed Square Kilometre Array may constrain primordial black holes in this mass range to comprise less than ~1-10% of the dark matter.",hep,hep-ph,Tau Neutrino Decays and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,"We investigate the non-radiative decay during nucleosynthesis of a massive tau neutrino with mass 0.1 - 1 MeV into an electron neutrino and a scalar or pseudoscalar particle, $\phi$. The full Boltzmann equation is used and shown to give markedly different results than the usual non-relativistic formalism for relativistic or semi-relativistic neutrino decays. Indeed, the region we investigate is where the formalism that has previously been applied to solving this problem is expected to break down. We also compare the nucleosynthesis predictions from this scenario with results from the standard model and with some of the available observational determinations of the primordial abundances. It is found that for relativistic or semi-relativistic decays the helium abundance can be significantly lowered without changing other light element abundances. Since a problem with the standard model of Big Bang nucleosynthesis is that helium appears to be overproduced, a decay of the type we discuss can be a possible solution.",hep,hep-ph,1
Search for Doubly-charged Higgs Boson Production in the Decay H++H-- -> mu+mu+mu-mu- with the DO Detector at sqrt{s}=1.96} TeV,"A search for the pair production of doubly-charged Higgs bosons in the process $\ppbar\to\Hpp\Hmm\to \mu^+\mu^+\mu^-\mu^-$ is performed with the D\O\ Run II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron using inclusive di-muon events. These data taken at an energy of $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV correspond to an integrated luminosity of $113 $pb$^{-1}$ and were recorded by D{\O}between August 2002 and June 2003. In the absence of a signal, 95% Confidence Level mass limits of $M(\HpmL)>118.6$ GeV and $M(\HpmR)>98.1$ GeV are set on the pair production cross section for left-handed and right-handed doubly-charged Higgs bosons, assuming 100% branching into muons and hypercharge $|Y|=2$.",hep,hep-ex,Vertex-Finding and Reconstruction of Contained Two-track Neutrino Events in the MicroBooNE Detector,"We describe algorithms developed to isolate and accurately reconstruct two-track events that are contained within the MicroBooNE detector. This method is optimized to reconstruct two tracks of lengths longer than 5 cm. This code has applications to searches for neutrino oscillations and measurements of cross sections using quasi-elastic-like charged current events. The algorithms we discuss will be applicable to all detectors running in Fermilab's Short Baseline Neutrino program (SBN), and to any future liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiment with beam energies ~1 GeV. The algorithms are publicly available on a GITHUB repository. This reconstruction offers a complementary and independent alternative to the Pandora reconstruction package currently in use in LArTPC experiments, and provides similar reconstruction performance for two-track events.",hep,hep-ex,1
On Raynal's posting in arXiv (nucl-th/0407060),"With nucl-th/0407060, Jacques Raynal uses the arXiv in a way which does not conform to standard professional practices. His posting contains many statements that are beyond the borders of acceptable scientific disputes, with the scope to defame colleagues by manifestly false or misleading statements. In this comment we reject the three ``critiques'' expressed by Raynal. 1. The fact that we possibly misquoted our references. 2. The role of the Pauli principle in these kind of calculations. 3. The nature and limits of our coupled-channel potential model. Raynal's postings unfairly detract from the importance of our work, which we published in Nuclear Physics A728, 65 (2003), on a new approach, Multi-Channel-Algebraic-Scattering (MCAS), for coupled-channel calculations. With the MCAS approach we were able to identify systematically all low-energy compound resonances, and to include effectively the Pauli principle in collective, geometrical-type, macroscopic models of multichannel interaction. This represents a clear advantage with respect to the current distribution of the ECIS formulation.",nucl,nucl-th,Three-body Halos. IV. Momentum Distributions after Fragmentation,Momentum distributions of particles from nuclear break-up of fast three-body halos are calculated incorporating effects of final state interactions. The same two-body interactions between the particles are used to calculate both the ground state structure and the final state of the reaction processes. The ground state wave function reproduces size and energy of the halo nucleus. First we give a general and detailed description of the method. Then we investigate the effect of final state interactions in neutron removal and core break-up reactions for one- and two-dimensional momentum distributions. We compute specifically core and neutron momentum distributions from 11Li fragmentation and compare those with available experimental data. We conclude that 11Li must have a neutron-core relative state containing a p-state admixture of 20\%-30\%. The fragmentation data also strongly suggest that 10Li has an s-state at about 50 keV and a p-state around 500 keV.,nucl,nucl-th,1
Photoionization cross section in a spherical quantum dot: Effects of some parabolic confining electric potentials,A theoretical investigation of the effects of spatial variation of confining electric potential on photoionization cross section (PCS) in a spherical quantum dot is presented. The potential profiles considered here are the shifted parabolic potential and the inverse lateral shifted parabolic potential compared with the well-studied parabolic potential. The primary findings are that parabolic potential and the inverse lateral shifted parabolic potential blue shift the peaks of the PCS while the shifted parabolic potential causes a red shift.,cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Quantum Hall effect at cleaved InSb surfaces and low-temperature annealing effect,We have performed low-temperature in-plane magnetotransport measurements on two-dimensional electron systems induced by deposition of Ag at {\it in situ} cleaved surfaces of {\it p}-type InSb. The quantum Hall effect was observed even at low magnetic fields around 2 T. The surface electron density and the electron mobility exhibit strong dependence on the Ag-coverage and the annealing temperature in the range of 15-40 K. The annealing effect suggests that the surface morphology strongly affects the properties of the two-dimensional electron systems.,cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
Investigation of the near-wake behaviour of a utility-scale wind turbine,"Super-large-scale particle image velocimetry and flow visualization with natural snowfall is used to collect and analyze multiple datasets in the near wake of a 2.5 MW wind turbine. Each dataset captures the full vertical span of the wake from a different perspective. Together, these datasets compose a three-dimensional picture of the near-wake flow, including the effect of the tower and hub and the variation of instantaneous wake expansion in response to changes in turbine operation. A region of high-speed flow is observed directly behind the hub, and a region of low-speed flow appears behind the tower. Additionally, the hub produces a region of enhanced turbulence in its wake while the tower reduces turbulence near the ground as it breaks up turbulent structures in the boundary layer. Analysis of the instantaneous wake behaviour reveals variations in wake expansion, and even periods of wake contraction, occurring in response to changes in the angle of attack and blade pitch gradient. This behaviour is found to depend on the region of operation of the turbine. These findings can be incorporated into wake models and advanced control algorithms for wind farm optimization and can be used to validate wind turbine wake simulations.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,Comparison of computational codes for direct numerical simulations of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection,"Computational codes for direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection are compared in terms of computational cost and quality of the solution. As a benchmark case, RB convection at $Ra=10^8$ and $Pr=1$ in a periodic domain, in cubic and cylindrical containers is considered. A dedicated second-order finite-difference code (AFID/RBflow) and a specialized fourth-order finite-volume code (Goldfish) are compared with a general purpose finite-volume approach (OpenFOAM) and a general purpose spectral-element code (Nek5000). Reassuringly, all codes provide predictions of the average heat transfer that converge to the same values. The computational costs, however, are found to differ considerably. The specialized codes AFID/RBflow and Goldfish are found to excel in efficiency, outperforming the general purpose flow solvers Nek5000 and OpenFOAM by an order of magnitude with an error on the Nusselt number $Nu$ below $5\%$. However, we find that $Nu$ alone is not sufficient to assess the quality of the numerical results: in fact, instantaneous snapshots of the temperature field from a near wall region obtained for deliberately under-resolved simulations using Nek5000 clearly indicate inadequate flow resolution even when $Nu$ is converged. Overall, dedicated special purpose codes for RB convection are found to be more efficient than general purpose codes.",physics,physics.flu-dyn,1
Integrating out the Standard Higgs Field in the Path Integral,"We integrate out the Higgs boson in the electroweak standard model at one loop and construct a low-energy effective Lagrangian assuming that the Higgs mass is much larger than the gauge-boson masses. Instead of applying diagrammatical techniques, we integrate out the Higgs boson directly in the path integral, which turns out to be much simpler. By using the background-field method and the Stueckelberg formalism, we directly find a manifestly gauge-invariant result. The heavy-Higgs effects on fermionic couplings are derived, too. At one loop the $\log\MH$-terms of the heavy-Higgs limit of the electroweak standard model coincide with the UV-divergent terms in the gauged non-linear $\sigma$-model, but vertex functions differ in addition by finite constant terms. Finally, the leading Higgs effects to some physical processes are calculated from the effective Lagrangian.",hep,hep-ph,Instability of a gapless color superconductor with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations,"We systematically apply density functional theory to determine the kind of inhomogeneities that spontaneously develop in a homogeneous gapless phase of neutral two-flavor superfluid quark matter. We consider inhomogeneities in the quark and electron densities and in the phases and amplitude of the order parameter. These inhomogeneities are expected to lead the gapless phase to a BCS-normal coexisting phase, a Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state with phase oscillations alone, and a LOFF state with amplitude oscillations. We find that which of them the homogeneous system tends towards depends sensitively on the chemical potential separation between up and down quarks and the gradient energies.",hep,hep-ph,1
"Non-planar double-box, massive and massless pentabox Feynman integrals in negative dimensional approach","Negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) is a technique which can be applied, with success, in usual covariant gauge calculations.

Properties of DBD Plasma Jets using Powered Electrode With and Without Contact with the Plasma,"An experimental investigation comparing the properties of plasma jets in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) configurations using a powered electrode with and without a dielectric barrier, while keeping a second dielectric barrier over the grounded electrode, is reported in this work. For this purpose, two different power sources were used to produce the plasma jets, with one of them producing a pulsed high-voltage (HV) output and the other one producing a pulse-like HV output, which consists of a damped sine HV waveform. Measurements of plasma parameters were performed for both configurations using argon and helium as working gases. As a result, if the pulsed power source is used, significant differences were found in discharge power ($P_{plasma}$), rotational and vibrational temperatures ($T_r$ and $T_v$, respectively) when switching from one configuration to the other. On the other hand, using the pulse-like HV only the $P_{plasma}$ parameter presented significant differences when switching the electrode's configuration. For the pulsed source it has been observed that despite the remarkable increase in $P_{plasma}$ when changing from the double barrier configuration to the single barrier one, the values obtained for $T_r$ and $T_v$ also increased, but not in the same proportion as the increase in $P_{plasma}$, which suggests a non-linear dependency between temperatures and discharge power in the plasma jet. As an example for application of plasmas in both configurations, tests in an attempt to remove copper films deposited on alumina substrates were performed and, as a result, there was significant material removal only when the powered electrode was in contact with the plasma. As a general conclusion, if higher power is really required for some application it is better to use this configuration.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,Topological approach for laser acceleration investigation,"An approach using topology reveals a new understanding and knowledge of laser particle acceleration. Laser pulse irradiation on a thin-foil target is examined using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Through topology, laser ion acceleration schemes are classified depending on whether the deformed target shape after laser irradiation is homeomorphic with respect to the initial target. High energy ions are generated with high-efficiency when the deformed target shape is non-homeomorphic. In this case, the target thickness greatly affects the obtained ion energy. However, when the deformed target shape is homeomorphic, the obtained ion energy is low, and the effect of the target thickness is small.",physics,physics.plasm-ph,1
Azimuthal asymmetries in single polarized proton-proton Drell-Yan processes,"We study the azimuthal asymmetries in proton-proton Drell-Yan processes with one incident proton being transversely or longitudinally polarized. We consider particularly the asymmetries contributed by the leading-twist chiral-odd quark distributions. We analyze the asymmetries with $\sin(2\phi+\phi_S)$ and $\sin(2\phi-\phi_S)$ modulations in transverse single polarized $p^\uparrow p$ Drell-Yan and $\sin2\phi$ asymmetries in longitudinal single polarized $p^\rightarrow p$ Drell-Yan at RHIC, J-PARC, E906 (Fermi Lab) and NICA (JINR). We show that the measurements of the asymmetries in those facilities can provide valuable information of the chiral-odd structure of the nucleon both in the valence and sea regions.",nucl,nucl-ex,A model-independent analysis of the dependence of the anomalous J/psi suppression on the number of participant nucleons,"A recently published experimental dependence of the J/psi to Drell-Yan ratio on the measured, by a zero degree calorimeter, forward energy E_ZDC in Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS is analyzed. Using a model-independent approach it is shown that the data are at variance with an earlier published experimental dependence of the same quantity on the transverse energy of neutral hadrons E_T. The discrepancy is related to a moderate centrality region: 100 < N_p < 200 (N_p is the number of participant nucleons) and is peculiar only to the data obtained within the `minimum bias' analysis (using the `theoretical Drell-Yan'). This could result from systematic experimental errors in the minimum bias sample. A possible source of the errors is discussed.",nucl,nucl-ex,1
A Young White Dwarf with an Infrared Excess,"Using observations of Spitzer/IRAC, we report the serendipitous discovery of excess infrared emission from a single white dwarf PG 0010+280. At a temperature of 27,220 K and a cooling age of 16 Myr, it is the hottest and youngest white dwarf to display an excess at 3-8 $\mu$m. The infrared excess can be fit by either an opaque dust disk within the tidal radius of the white dwarf or a 1300 K blackbody, possibly from an irradiated substellar object or a re-heated giant planet. PG 0010+280 has two unique properties that are different from white dwarfs with a dust disk: (i) relatively low emission at 8 $\mu$m and (ii) non-detection of heavy elements in its atmosphere from high-resolution spectroscopic observations with Keck/HIRES.

Using transit observations from TESS, LCOGT, OPM, Whitin, Wendelstein, OAUV, Ca l'Ou, and KeplerCam along with radial velocity observations from HARPS-N and NEID, we find that the planet has a radius of $R_p$ = 11.9 $\pm$ 0.3 $R_\Earth$ and a mass of $M_p$ = 25.1 $\pm$ 3.8 $M_\Earth$. TOI-1420b is the largest-known planet with a mass less than $50M_\Earth$, indicating that it contains a sizeable envelope of hydrogen and helium. We determine TOI-1420b's envelope mass fraction to be $f_{env} = 82^{+7}_{-6}\%$, suggesting that runaway gas accretion occurred when its core was at most $4-5\times$ the mass of the Earth. TOI-1420b is similar to the planet WASP-107b in mass, radius, density, and orbital period, so a comparison of these two systems may help reveal the origins of close-in low-density planets. With an atmospheric scale height of 1950 km, a transmission spectroscopy metric of 580, and a predicted Rossiter-McLaughlin amplitude of about $17$ m s$^{-1}$, TOI-1420b is an excellent target for future atmospheric and dynamical characterization.",astro-ph,astro-ph.EP,1
Spectral performance of the Microchannel X-ray Telescope on board the SVOM mission,"The Microchannel X-ray Telescope (MXT) is an innovative compact X-ray instrument on board the SVOM astronomical mission dedicated to the study of transient phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts. During 3 weeks, we have tested the MXT flight model at the Panter X-ray test facility under the nominal temperature and vacuum conditions that MXT will undergo in-flight. We collected data at series of characteristic energies probing the entire MXT energy range, from 0.28 keV up to 9 keV, for multiple source positions with the center of the point spread function (PSF) inside and outside the detector field of view (FOV). We stacked the data of the positions with the PSF outside the FOV to obtain a uniformly illuminated matrix and reduced all data sets using a dedicated pipeline. We determined the best spectral performance of MXT using an optimized data processing, especially for the energy calibration and the charge sharing effect induced by the pixel low energy thresholding. Our results demonstrate that MXT is compliant with the instrument requirement regarding the energy resolution (<80 eV at 1.5 keV), the low and high energy threshold, and the accuracy of the energy calibration ($\pm$20 eV). We also determined the charge transfer inefficiency (~$10^{-5}$) of the detector and modeled its evolution with energy prior to the irradiation that MXT will undergo during its in-orbit lifetime. Finally, we measured the relation of the energy resolution as function of the photon energy. We determined an equivalent noise charge of 4.9 $\pm$ 0.2 e- rms for the MXT detection chain and a Fano factor of 0.131 $\pm$ 0.003 in silicon at 208 K, in agreement with previous works.

It turns out that the MC can be worked out due to Poynting-Robertson cosmic battery (PRCB), and the 3:2 HFQPO pairs associated with the steep power-law states can be fitted in this model. Furthermore, the severe damping problem in the epicyclic resonance model can be overcome by transferring energy from the BH to the inner disc via the MC process for emitting X-rays with sufficient amplitude and coherence to produce the HFQPOs.

ARPES and optical renormalizations: phonons or spin fluctuations,"Improved resolution in both, energy and momentum in ARPES-data has lead to the establishment of a definite energy scale in the dressed quasiparticle dispersion relations.

Here we address the relative merits of phonon as opposed to spin fluctuation mechanisms. Both possibilities are consistent with ARPES.

For a translationally invariant (but time-dependent) Hamiltonian, we also provide sum rules in momentum space.

Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations with a frequency {\it F} of $\sim$100 T are observed for a wide range of field directions in the {\it ac} and {\it bc} planes, and the quasiparticle mass is determined to be $\sim$10-20 {\it m}$_e$. The carrier density is estimated to be $\sim10^{-3}$ electron/Ce. In a narrow range of field directions in the {\it ac} plane, where the magnetoresistance-dip anomaly manifests itself clearer than in other field directions, a higher-frequency ($F=300\sim400\text{T}$) SdH oscillation is found at high fields above the anomaly. This observation is discussed in terms of possible field-induced changes in the electronic structure.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Incorporating the Stern-Gerlach delayed-choice quantum eraser into the undergraduate quantum mechanics curriculum,"As ""Stern-Gerlach first"" becomes the new paradigm within the undergraduate quantum mechanics curriculum, we show how one can extend the treatment found in conventional textbooks to cover some of the exciting new developments within the quantum field. Namely, we illustrate how one can employ Dirac notation and conventional quantum rules to describe a delayed choice variant of the quantum eraser which is realized within the Stern-Gerlach framework. Covering this material, allows the instructor to reinforce notions of changes of basis functions, quantum superpositions, quantum measurement, and the complementarity principle as expressed in whether we know ""which-way"" information or not. It also allows the instructor to dispel common misconceptions of when a measurement occurs and when a system is in a superposition of states. We comment at the end how a similar methodology can be employed when the more conventional two-slit experiment is treated.",physics,physics.ed-ph,Instructional Strategies that Foster Effective Problem-Solving,"Helping students become proficient problem solvers is a major goal of many physics courses from introductory to advanced levels. In fact, physics has often been used by cognitive scientists to investigate the differences between the problem-solving strategies of expert and novice problem solvers because it is a domain in which there is reasonably good agreement about what constitutes good problem-solving. Since the laws of physics are encapsulated in compact mathematical form, becoming an expert physics problem solver entails learning to unpack and interpret those physical laws as well as being able to apply them in diverse situations while solving problems. A physics expert must have a well-organized knowledge structure of relevant physics and math concepts and be able to manage cognitive load and do metacognition while solving complex problems. In this chapter, we review foundational research on expertise in physics problem-solving and then discuss research on instructional strategies that promote effective problem-solving as well as challenges in changing the instructional practices of physics instructors and teaching assistants via professional development to promote and support effective problem-solving approaches.",physics,physics.ed-ph,1
Tachyonic Inflation in the Braneworld Scenario,"We consider cosmological inflation driven by the rolling tachyon in the context of the braneworld scenario. We show that sufficient inflation consistent with the observational constraints can be achieved for well defined upper limits on the five-dimensional mass scale, string mass scale and the string coupling for the bosonic string.",hep,hep-ph,Anomalous Violation of Conservation Laws in Minkowski Space,"We consider the evolution of quantum fermi fields in Minkowski gauge field backgrounds. Our motivation is the study of anomalous fermion number violating processes. We derive selection rules for fermion scattering amplitudes which relate the violation of fermionic charge to the change in winding between early and late times of the vacuum part of the gauge field. We find that the amount of fermion number violation is always integer, even when the topological charge of the gauge field is fractional. As an explicit example, we apply our results to spherically symmetric Minkowski solutions.",hep,hep-ph,1
Using cluster theory to calculate the experimental structure factors of antibody solutions,"Monoclonal antibody solutions are set to become a major therapeutic tool in the years to come, capable of targeting various diseases by clever designing their antigen binding site. However, the formulation of stable solutions suitable for patient self-administration typically presents challenges, as a result of the increase in viscosity that often occurs at high concentrations. Here, we establish a link between the microscopic molecular details and the resulting properties of an antibody solution through the characterization of clusters, which arise in the presence of self-associating antibodies. In particular, we find that experimental small-angle X-ray scattering data can be interpreted by means of analytical models previously exploited for the study of polymeric and colloidal objects, based on the presence of such clusters. The latter are determined by theoretical calculations and supported by computer simulations of a coarse-grained minimal model, in which antibodies are treated as Y-shaped colloidal molecules and attractive domains are designed as patches. Using the theoretically-predicted cluster size distributions, we are able to describe the experimental structure factors over a wide range of concentration and salt conditions. We thus provide microscopic evidence for the well-established fact that the concentration-dependent increase in viscosity is originated by the presence of clusters. Our findings bring new insights on the self-assembly of monoclonal antibodies, which can be exploited for guiding the formulation of stable and effective antibody solutions.",cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,Circling particles and drafting in optical vortices,Particles suspended in a viscous fluid circle in optical vortices generated by holographic optical-tweezer techniques [Curtis J E and Grier D G 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 90 133901]. We model this system and show that hydrodynamic interactions between the circling particles determine their collective motion. We perform a linear-stability analysis to investigate the stability of regular particle clusters and illustrate the limit cycle to which the unstable modes converge. We clarify that drafting of particle doublets is essential for the understanding of the limit cycle.,cond-mat,cond-mat.soft,1
Longitudinal $\bar \Lambda_0$ polarization in heavy ion collisions as a probe for QGP formation,"We present an analysis of the longitudinal $\bar \Lambda_0$ polarization in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The polarization of $\bar \Lambda_0$'s coming from the decay chain $\bar{\Xi}\to \bar{\Lambda}_0+\pi$ exhibits a very well differentiated behavior depending on the production region of the primordial $\bar \Xi$'s. This effect reflects the different values of the $N_{\bar \Xi}/N_{\bar \Lambda_0}$ ratio in the QGP region, where nucleon-nucleon interactions take place in a hot and dense environment, and the peripherical region, in which ordinary nucleon-nucleon interactions occur. An increase in the longitudinal $\bar \Lambda_0$ polarization signals a strangeness enhancement which is thought as a property of the QGP phase.",hep,hep-ph,The 28 GeV Dimuon Excess in Lepton Specific 2HDM,"We explore the Higgs mass spectrum in a class of Two Higgs Doublet Models (THDMs) in which a scalar SU(2)_L doublet interacts only with quarks, while the second one interacts only with leptons. The spectrum includes two CP-even Higgs bosons, either of which can account for the SM-like Higgs boson, and the spectra involving light Higgs bosons receive strong impacts from the LEP results and the current collider analyses. We find that a consistent spectrum can involve a CP-odd Higgs boson as light as about 10 GeV, while the lightest CP-even Higgs boson cannot be lighter than about 55 GeV when m_A ~ 28 GeV. These analyses can rather bound the low tan beta region which can also accommodate an observed excess in dimuon events at m_mumu ~ 28 GeV. A lepton-specific class of THDMs (LS-THDM) can predict such an excess through A -> mu mu decays, while the solutions can be constrained by the A -> tau tau mode. After constraining the solutions with the consistent ranges of sigma(pp -> bbA -> bb tau tau), a largest excess at about 1.5 sigma at 8 TeV center of mass (COM) energy and 2 sigma at 13 TeV COM is observed for tan beta ~ 12 and m_A ~ 28 GeV in the sigma(pp -> bbA -> bb mu mu) events.",hep,hep-ph,1
Accuracy of effective mass equation for a single and double cylindrical quantum dot,"In this contribution we study the accuracy of various forms of electron effective mass equation in reproducing spectral and spin-related features of quantum dot systems. We compare the results of the standard 8 band k.p model to those obtained from effective mass equations obtained by perturbative elimination procedures in various approximations for a cylindrical quantum dot or a system of two such dots. We calculate the splitting of electronic shells, the electron g-factor and spin-orbit induced spin mixing and show that for a cylindrical dot the g-factor is reproduced very exactly, while for the two other quantities the effective mass equation is much less accurate.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Helical liquids and Majorana bound states in quantum wires,"We show that the combination of spin-orbit coupling with a Zeeman field or strong interactions may lead to the formation of a helical liquid in single-channel quantum wires. In a helical liquid, electrons with opposite velocities have opposite spin precession. We argue that zero-energy Majorana bound states are formed in various situations when the wire is situated in proximity to a conventional s-wave superconductor. This occurs when the external magnetic field, the superconducting gap, or, in particular, the chemical potential vary along the wire. We discuss experimental consequences of the formation of the helical liquid and the Majorana bound states.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
The formation of the young massive cluster B1 in the Antennae galaxies (NGC 4038/NGC 4039) triggered by cloud-cloud collision,"The Antennae Galaxies is one of the starbursts in major mergers. Tsuge et al. (2020) showed that the five giant molecular complexes in the Antennae Galaxies have signatures of cloud-cloud collisions based on the ALMA archival data at 60 pc resolution. In the present work we analyzed the new CO data toward the super star cluster (SSC) B1 at 14 pc resolution obtained with ALMA, and confirmed that two clouds show complementary distribution with a displacement of $\sim$70 pc as well as the connecting bridge features between them. The complementary distribution shows a good correspondence with the theoretical collision model (Takahira et al. 2014), and indicates that SSC B1 having $\sim$10$^{6}$ $M$$_{\odot}$ was formed by the trigger of a cloud-cloud collision with a time scale of $\sim$1Myr, which is consistent with the cluster age. It is likely that SSC B1 was formed from molecular gas of $\sim$10$^{7}$ $M$$_{\odot}$ with a star formation efficiency of $\sim$10 % in 1 Myr. We identified a few places where additional clusters are forming. Detailed gas motion indicates stellar feedback in accelerating gas is not effective, while ionization plays a role in evacuating the gas around the clusters at a $\sim$30-pc radius. The results have revealed the details of the parent gas where a cluster having mass similar to a globular is being formed.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,"A millimeter-wave redshift search for the unlensed HyLIRG, HS1700.850.1","We report the redshift of an unlensed, highly obscured submillimetre galaxy (SMG), HS1700.850.1, the brightest SMG (S850um =19.1 mJy) detected in the JCMT/SCUBA-2 Baryonic Structure Survey, based on the detection of its CO line emission. Using the IRAM PdBI-WIDEX with 3.6GHz band width, we serendipitously detect an emission line at 150.6 GHz. From a search over 14.5 GHz in the 3-mm and 2-mm atmospheric windows, we confirm the identification of this line as CO(5-4) at z = 2.816, meaning that it does not reside in the z~2.30 proto-cluster in this field. Measurement of the 870um source size (<0.85"") from the Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) confirms a compact emission in a S870um =14.5mJy, LIR~10^13 Lsun component, suggesting an Eddington-limited starburst. We use the double-peaked CO line profile measurements along with the SMA size constraints to study the gas dynamics of a HyLIRG, estimating the gas and dynamical masses of HS1700.850.1. While HS1700.850.1 is one of the most extreme galaxies known in the Universe, we find that it occupies a relative void in the Lyman-Break Galaxy distribution in this field. Comparison with other extreme objects at similar epochs (HyLIRG Quasars), and cosmological simulations, suggests such an anti-bias of bright SMGs could be relatively common, with the brightest SMGs rarely occupying the most overdense regions at z=2-4.",astro-ph,astro-ph.GA,1
Superconductivity by Kinetic Energy Saving?,"A brief introduction is given in the generic microscopic framework of superconductivity. The consequences for the temperature dependence of the kinetic energy, and the correlation energy are discussed for two cases: The BCS scenario and the non-Fermi liquid scenario. A quantitative comparison is made between the BCS-prediction for d-wave pairing in a band with nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor hoppping and the experimental specific heat and the optical intraband spectral weight along the plane. We show that the BCS-prediction produces the wrong sign for the kink at Tc of the intraband spectral weight, even though the model calculation agrees well with the specific heat.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Majorana zero modes in a quantum wire platform without Rashba spin-orbit coupling,"We propose a platform for engineering helical fermions in a hybridized double-quantum-wire setup.

The goal of this proposal is to expand the group of available Hamiltonians to those without strong Rashba spin-orbit interactions which are essential to many other approaches. Furthermore, we show that there exist electron-electron interactions that stabilize fractional excitations which obey $\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{3}$ parafermionic algebra.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1

While a good agreement is obtained with Tevatron data, some discrepancies especially for the rapidity separation between jets are found that can be explained by an excess of initial state radiation in PYTHIA.",hep,hep-ph,1
Foreground removal requirements for measuring large-scale CMB B-modes in light of BICEP2,"The most convincing confirmation that the B-mode polarization signal detected at degree scales by BICEP2 is due to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) would be the measurement of its large-scale counterpart. We assess the requirements for diffuse component separation accuracy over large portions of the sky in order to measure the large-scale B-mode signal corresponding to a tensor to scalar ratio of r=0.1-0.2. We use the method proposed by Bonaldi & Ricciardi (2011) to forecast the performances of different simulated experiments taking into account noise and foreground removal issues. We do not consider instrumental systematics, and we implicitly assume that they are not the dominant source of error. If this is the case, the confirmation of an r=0.1-0.2 signal is achievable by Planck even for conservative assumptions regarding the accuracy of foreground cleaning. Our forecasts suggest that the combination of this experiment with BICEP2 will lead to an improvement of 25-45% in the constraint on r. A next-generation CMB polarization satellite, represented in this work by the COrE experiment, can reduce dramatically (by almost another order of magnitude) the uncertainty on r. In this case, however, the accuracy of foreground removal becomes critical to fully benefit from the increase in sensitivity.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,Chemistry of heavy elements in the Dark Ages,"Primordial molecules were formed during the Dark Ages, i.e. the time between recombination and reionization in the early Universe. The purpose of this article is to analyze the formation of primordial molecules based on heavy elements during the Dark Ages, with elemental abundances taken from different nucleosynthesis models. We present calculations of the full non-linear equation set governing the primordial chemistry. We consider the evolution of 45 chemical species and use an implicit multistep method of variable order of precision with an adaptive stepsize control. We find that the most abundant Dark Ages molecules based on heavy elements are CH and OH. Non-standard nucleosynthesis can lead to higher heavy element abundances while still satisfying the observed primordial light abundances. In that case, we show that the abundances of molecular species based on C, N, O and F can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case, leading to a CH relative abundance higher than that of HD+ or H2D+.",astro-ph,astro-ph.CO,1
Structural Dynamics of incommensurate Charge-Density Waves tracked by Ultrafast Low-Energy Electron Diffraction,"We study the non-equilibrium structural dynamics of the incommensurate and nearly-commensurate charge-density wave phases in 1T-TaS$_2$. Employing ultrafast low-energy electron diffraction (ULEED) with 1 ps temporal resolution, we investigate the ultrafast quench and recovery of the CDW-coupled periodic lattice distortion. Sequential structural relaxation processes are observed by tracking the intensities of main lattice as well as satellite diffraction peaks as well as the diffuse scattering background. Comparing distinct groups of diffraction peaks, we disentangle the ultrafast quench of the PLD amplitude from phonon-related reductions of the diffraction intensity. Fluence-dependent relaxation cycles reveal a long-lived partial suppression of the order parameter for up to 60 picoseconds, far outlasting the initial amplitude recovery and electron-phonon scattering times. This delayed return to a quasi-thermal level is controlled by lattice thermalization and coincides with the population of zone-center acoustic modes, as evidenced by a structured diffuse background. The long-lived non-equilibrium order parameter suppression suggests hot populations of CDW-coupled lattice modes. Finally, a broadening of the superlattice peaks is observed at high fluences, pointing to a nonlinear generation of phase fluctuations.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Gap and pseudogap evolution within the charge-ordering scenario for superconducting cuprates,"We describe the spectral properties of underdoped cuprates as resulting from a momentum-dependent pseudogap in the normal state spectrum. Such a model accounts, within a BCS approach, for the doping dependence of the critical temperature and for the two-parameter leading-edge shift observed in the cuprates. By introducing a phenomenological temperature dependence of the pseudogap, which finds a natural interpretation within the stripe quantum-critical-point scenario for high-T_c superconductors, we reproduce also the T_c-T^* bifurcation near optimum doping. Finally, we briefly discuss the different role of the gap and the pseudogap in determining the spectral and thermodynamical properties of the model at low temperatures.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Probing the Hofstadter butterfly with the quantum oscillation of magnetization,"We have developed a different quantum transfer matrix method to accurately determine thermodynamic properties of the Hofstadter model. This method resolves a technical problem which is intractable by other methods and makes the calculation of physical quantities of the Hofstadter model in the thermodynamic limit at finite temperatures feasible. It is shown that the quantum correction to the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation of magnetization bears the energy structure of Hofstadter butterfly. The measurement of this quantum correction, which can be materialized on the superlattice or cold atom systems, can reveal unambiguously the Hofstadter fractal energy spectrum.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Combined analytical and numerical approach to magnetization plateaux in one-dimensional spin tube antiferromagnets,"In this paper, we investigate the properties of frustrated three-leg spin tubes under a magnetic field. We concentrate on two kind of geometries for these tubes, one of which is relevant for the compound $\mathrm{[(CuCl_2tachH)_3Cl]Cl_2}$. We combine an analytical path integral approach with a strong coupling approach, as well as large-scale Density Matrix Renormalization Groups (DMRG) simulations, to identify the presence of plateaux in the magnetization curve as a function of the value of spin $S$. We also investigate the issue of gapless non-magnetic excitations on some plateaux, dubbed chirality degrees of freedom for both tubes.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
Simulation consensus model of never changed opinions in Sznajd consensus model using multi-spin coding,"The density of never changed opinions during the Sznajd consensus-finding process decays with time t as 1/t^{theta}. We find theta ~= 3/8 for a chain, compatible with the exact Ising result of Derrida et al. In higher dimensions, however, the exponent differs from the Ising theta. With simultaneous updating of sublattices instead of the usual random sequential updating, the number of persistent opinions decays roughly exponentially.

The condensate fraction, chemical potential, ground state energy, and specific heat of the system are calculated for various values of interaction strengths.

Extracting the rho-omega mixing amplitude from the pion form-factor,"We re-examine and extend a recent analysis which showed that the rho-omega mixing amplitude cannot be unambiguously extracted from the pion electromagnetic form-factor in a model independent way. In particular, we focus on the argument that the extraction is sensitive to the presence of any intrinsic omega_I -> 2pi coupling. Our extended analysis confirms the original conclusion, with only minor, quantitative differences. The extracted mixing amplitude is shown to be sensitive to both the intrinsic coupling omega_I -> 2pi and to the value assumed for the mass of the neutral rho meson.",nucl,nucl-th,Magic radioactivity of 252Cf,"We show that the sharp maximum corresponding to 107Mo in the fragment distribution of the 252Cf cold fission is actually a Sn-like radioactivity, similar to other decay processes in which magic nuclei are involved, namely alpha-decay and heavy cluster emission, also called Pb-like radioactivity. It turns out that the mass asymmetry degree of freedom has a key role in connecting initial Sn with the final Mo isotopes along the fission path. We suppose the cold rearrangement of nucleons within the framework of the two center shell model, in order to compute the cold valleys in the charge equilibrated fragmentation potential. The fission yields are estimated by using the semiclassical penetration approach. We consider five degrees of freedom, namely the inter-fragment distance, the shapes of fragments, the neck parameter and mass asymmetry. We found an isomeric minimum between the internal and external barriers. It turns out that the inner cold valley of the total potential energy is connected to the double magic isotope 132Sn",nucl,nucl-th,1
Galaxy clustering constraints on deviations from Newtonian gravity at cosmological scales,"In spite of the growing observational evidence for dark matter and dark energy in the universe, their physical nature is largely unknown. In fact, several authors have proposed modifications of Newton's law of gravity at cosmological scales to account for the apparent acceleration of the cosmic expansion. Inspired by such suggestions, we attempt to constrain possible deviations from Newtonian gravity by means of the clustering of SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) galaxies. To be specific, we assume a simple modification of Newton's law with an additional Yukawa-type term characterized by the amplitude \alpha and the length scale \lambda. Adopting spatially-flat universes dominated by cold dark matter and/or dark energy, we solve a linear perturbation equation for the growth of density fluctuations. In particular, we find an exact analytic solution for the Einstein -- de Sitter case. Following the Peacock-Dodds prescription, we compute the nonlinear power spectra of mass fluctuations, perform a statistical comparison with the SDSS galaxy data, and derive constraints in the \alpha-\lambda plane; for instance, we obtain the constraints of -0.5<\alpha <0.6 and -0.8<\alpha<0.9 (99.7% confidence level) for \lambda=5h^{-1}Mpc and 10h^{-1}Mpc, respectively. We also discuss several future possibilities for improving our analysis.",hep,hep-th,"Confinement, Glueballs and Strings from Deformed AdS","We study aspects of confinement in two deformed versions of the AdS/CFT correspondence - the GPPZ dual of N=1* Yang Mills, and the Yang Mills* N=0 dual. Both geometries describe discrete glueball spectra which we calculate numerically. The results agree at the 10% level with previous AdS/CFT computations in the Klebanov Strassler background and AdS Schwarzchild respectively. We also calculate the spectra of bound states of the massive fermions in these geometries and show that they are light, so not decoupled from the dynamics. We then study the behaviour of Wilson loops in the 10d lifts of these geometries. We find a transition from AdS-like strings in the UV to strings that interact with the unknown physics of the central singularity of the space in the IR.",hep,hep-th,1
Heat conduction in a three-dimensional momentum-conserving fluid,"Size-dependence of energy transport and the effects of reduced dimensionality on transport coefficients are of key importance for understanding nonequilibrium properties of matter on the nanoscale. Here, we perform nonequilibrium and equilibrium simulations of heat conduction in a 3D fluid with the multiparticle collision dynamics, interacting with two thermal-walls. We find that the bulk 3D momentum-conserving fluid has a finite non-diverging thermal conductivity. However, for large aspect-ratios of the simulation box, a crossover from 3D to one-dimensional (1D) abnormal behavior of the thermal conductivity occurs. In this case, we demonstrate a transition from normal to abnormal transport by a suitable decomposition of the energy current. These results not only provide a direct verification of Fourier's law but also further confirm the validity of existing theories for 3D fluids. Moreover, they indicate that abnormal heat transport persists also for almost 1D fluids over a large range of sizes.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Structural and Dynamical Fingerprints of the Anomalous Dielectric Properties of Water Under Confinement,"There is a long-standing question about the molecular configuration of interfacial water molecules in the proximity of solid surfaces, particularly carbon atoms which play a crucial role in electrochemistry and biology. In this study, the dielectric, structural and dynamical properties of confined water placed between two parallel graphene walls at different inter distances from the Angstrom scale to few tens of nanometer have been investigated using molecular dynamics. For dielectric properties of water, we show that the perpendicular component of water dielectric constant drastically decreases under sub $2\; nm$ spatial confinement. The achieved dielectric constant data through linear response and fluctuation-dissipation theory, are consistent with recent reported experimental results. By determining the charge density as well as fluctuations in the number of atoms, we provide a molecular rationale for the behavior of perpendicular dielectric response function. We also interpret the behavior of the dielectric response in terms of the presence of dangling O-H bonds of waters. By examining the residence time and lateral diffusion constant of water under confinement, we reveal that the water molecules tend to keep their hydrogen bond networks at the interface of water-graphene. We also found consistency between lateral diffusion and z-component of variance in the center of mass of the system as a function of confinement.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
RG-improvement of the effective action with multiple mass scales,"Improving the effective action by the renormalization group (RG) with several mass scales is an important problem in quantum field theories. A method based on the decoupling theorem was proposed in \cite{Bando:1992wy} and systematically improved \cite{Casas:1998cf} to take threshold effects into account. In this paper, we apply the method to the Higgs-Yukawa model, including wave-function renormalizations, and to a model with two real scalar fields $(\varphi, h)$. In the Higgs-Yukawa model, even at one-loop level, Feynman diagrams contain propagators with different mass scales and decoupling scales must be chosen appropriately to absorb threshold corrections. On the other hand, in the two-scalar model, the mass matrix of the scalar fields is a function of their field values $(\varphi, h)$ and the resultant running couplings obey different RGEs on a different point of the field space. By solving the RGEs, we can obtain the RG improved effective action in the whole region of the scalar fields.",hep,hep-ph,Probing photon structure in DVCS on a photon target,"The factorization of the amplitude for the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) process gamma*(Q) gamma -> gamma gamma at high Q2 is demonstrated in two distinct kinematical domains, allowing to define the photon generalized parton distributions and the diphoton generalized distribution amplitudes.

"Dressed vs. Pairwise States, and the Geometric Phase of Monopoles and Charges","We construct the Faddeev-Kulish dressed multiparticle states of electrically and magnetically charged particles, incorporating the effects of real and virtual soft photons. We calculate the properties of such dressed states under Lorentz transformations, and find that they can be identified with the pairwise multi-particle states that transform under the pairwise little group. The shifts in the dressing factors under Lorentz transformations are finite and have a simple geometric interpretation. Using the transformation properties of the dressed states we also present a novel, fully quantum field theoretic derivation of the geometric (Berry) phase obtained by an adiabatic rotation of the Dirac string, and also of the Dirac quantization condition. For half integer pairwise helcity, we show that these multiparticle states have flipped spin-statistics, reproducing the surprising fact that fermions can be made out of bosons.",hep,hep-th,Affinity of NJL$_2$ and NJL$_{4}$ model results on duality and pion condensation in chiral asymmetric dense quark matter,"In this paper we investigate the phase structure of a (1+1) and (3+1)-dimensional quark model with four-quark interaction and in the presence of baryon ($\mu_B$), isospin ($\mu_I$) and chiral isospin ($\mu_{I5}$) chemical potentials. It is shown that the chemical potential $\mu_{I5}$ promotes the appearance of the charged PC phase with nonzero baryon density. Results of both models are qualitatively the same, this fact enhances one's confidence in %the faith in the obtained predictions.

Dynamics of anisotropic oxygen-ion migration in strained cobaltites,"Orientation control of oxygen vacancy channel (OVC) is a highly desirable for tailoring oxygen diffusion as it serves fast transport channel in ion conductors, which is widespread exploited in solid-state fuel cells, catalysts, and ion-batteries. Direct observation of oxygen-ions hopping towards preferential vacant sites is a key to clarifying migration pathways. Here we report the anisotropic oxygen-ion migration mediated by strain in ultrathin cobaltites via in-situ thermal activation in an atomic-resolved transmission electron microscopy. Oxygen migration pathways are constructed on the basis of the atomic structure during the OVC switching, which is manifested as the vertical-to-horizontal OVC switching under tensile strain, but the horizontal-to-diagonal switching under compression. We evaluate the topotactic structural changes to OVC, determine the crucial role of tolerance factor for OVC stability and establish the strain-dependent phase diagram.

Variance-Based Sensitivity Analysis of $\Lambda$-type Quantum Memory,"The storage and retrieval of photonic quantum states, quantum memory, is a key resource for a wide range of quantum applications. Here we investigate the sensitivity of $\Lambda$-type quantum memory to experimental fluctuations and drift. We use a variance-based approach, focusing on the effects of fluctuations and drift on memory efficiency. We consider shot-to-shot fluctuations of the memory parameters, and separately we consider longer timescale drift of the control field parameters. We find the parameters that a quantum memory is most sensitive to depend on the quantum memory protocol being employed, where the observed sensitivity agrees with physical interpretation of the protocols. We also present a general framework that is applicable to other figures of merit beyond memory efficiency. These results have practical ramifications for quantum memory experiments.",physics,physics.optics,Polarization-Selective Control of Nonlinear Optomechanical Interactions in Subwavelength Elliptical Waveguides,"Photonic devices exhibiting all-optically reconfigurable polarization dependence with a large dynamic range would be highly attractive for active polarization control. Here, we report that strongly polarization-selective nonlinear optomechanical interactions emerge in subwavelength waveguides. By using full-vectorial finite element analysis, we find that at certain core ellipticities (aspect ratios) the forward simulated light scattering mediated by a specific acoustic mode is eliminated for one polarization mode, whereas that for the other polarization mode is rather enhanced. This intriguing phenomenon can be explained by the interplay between the electrostrictive force and radiation pressure and turns out to be tailorable by choice of waveguide materials.",physics,physics.optics,1
Spin-polarized electron transmission in DNA-like systems,"The helical distribution of the electronic density in chiral molecules, such as DNA and bacteriorhodopsin, has been suggested to induce a spin-orbit coupling interaction that may lead to the so-called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. Key ingredients for the theoretical modelling are, in this context, the helically shaped potential of the molecule and, concomitantly, a Rashba-like spin-orbit coupling due to the appearance of a magnetic field in the electron reference frame. Symmetries of these models clearly play a crucial role in explaining the observed effect, but a thorough analysis has been largely ignored in the literature. In this work, we present a study of these symmetries and how they can be exploited to enhance chiral-induced spin selectivity in helical molecular systems.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,Quantum Interference in Off-Resonant Transport through Single Molecules,"We provide a simple set of rules for predicting interference effects in off-resonant transport through single-molecule junctions. These effects fall in two classes, showing respectively an odd or an even number of nodes in the linear conductance within a given molecular charge state, and we demonstrate how to decide the interference class directly from the contacting geometry. For neutral alternant hydrocarbons, we employ the Coulson-Rushbrooke-McLachlan pairing theorem to show that the interference class is decided simply by tunneling on and off the molecule from same, or different sublattices. More generally, we investigate a range of smaller molecules by means of exact diag- onalization combined with a perturbative treatment of the molecule-lead tunnel coupling. While these results generally agree well with GW calculations, they are shown to be at odds with simpler mean-field treatments. For molecules with spin-degenerate ground states, we show that for most junctions, interference causes no transmission nodes, but argue that it may lead to a non-standard gate-dependence of the zero-bias Kondo resonance.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mes-hall,1
On the properties of level spacings for decomposable systems,"In this paper we show that the quantum theory of chaos, based on the statistical theory of energy spectra, presents inconsistencies difficult to overcome. In classical mechanics a system described by an hamiltonian $H = H_1 + H_2$ (decomposable) cannot be ergodic, because there are always two dependent integrals of motion besides the constant of energy. In quantum mechanics we prove the existence of decomposable systems \linebreak $H^q = H^q_1 + H^q_2$ whose spacing distribution agrees with the Wigner law and we show that in general the spacing distribution of $H^q$ is not the Poisson law, even if it has often the same qualitative behaviour. We have found that the spacings of $H^q$ are among the solutions of a well defined class of homogeneous linear systems. We have obtained an explicit formula for the bases of the kernels of these systems, and a chain of inequalities which the coefficients of a generic linear combination of the basis vectors must satisfy so that the elements of a particular solution will be all positive, i.e. can be considered a set of spacings.",nlin,nlin.CD,Correlation-Hole Method for Spectra of Superconducting Microwave Billiards,"The spectral fluctuation properties of various two- and three-dimensional superconducting billiard systems are investigated by employing the correlation-hole method. It rests on the sensitivity of the spectral Fourier transform to long range correlations and is thus an alternative technique to study chaotic dynamics. First, we apply the method to the eigenfrequencies which are extracted from the measured resonances. Second, we analyze the unfolded raw spectra, including the shape of the resonances. The merit of the method lies in a clear separation of the statistics due to the positions and due to the shape of the resonances. However, we show that statistical fluctuations of the intensities of the resonances have a strong impact on the observable. Therefore, the visibility of the correlation hole is studied as a function of the number of independent statistical variables entering into the intensities. The visibility improves if independent spectra are superimposed.",nlin,nlin.CD,1
Tripartite Entanglement Extraction from the Black Hole Vacuum,"The first investigation of tripartite entanglement harvesting in the vicinity of a black hole is carried out. Working in the context of a static Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole spacetime we find that it is possible to harvest tripartite entanglement in regions where harvesting of bipartite entanglement is known to be impossible due to intense Hawking radiation. In these situations, it implies that the harvested entanglement is of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type.",hep,hep-th,On Integrable Quantum Group Invariant Antiferromagnets,A new open spin chain hamiltonian is introduced. It is both integrable (Sklyanin`s type $K$ matrices are used to achieve this) and invariant under ${\cal U}_{\epsilon}(sl(2))$ transformations in nilpotent irreps for $\epsilon^3=1$. Some considerations on the centralizer of nilpotent representations and its representation theory are also presented.,hep,hep-th,1
Position distribution in a generalised run and tumble process,"We study a class of stochastic processes of the type $\frac{d^n x}{dt^n}= v_0\, \sigma(t)$ where $n>0$ is a positive integer and $\sigma(t)=\pm 1$ represents an `active' telegraphic noise that flips from one state to the other with a constant rate $\gamma$. For $n=1$, it reduces to the standard run and tumble process for active particles in one dimension. This process can be analytically continued to any $n>0$ including non-integer values. We compute exactly the mean squared displacement at time $t$ for all $n>0$ and show that at late times while it grows as $\sim t^{2n-1}$ for $n>1/2$, it approaches a constant for $n<1/2$. In the marginal case $n=1/2$, it grows very slowly with time as $\sim \ln t$. Thus the process undergoes a {\em localisation} transition at $n=1/2$. We also show that the position distribution $p_n(x,t)$ remains time-dependent even at late times for $n\ge 1/2$, but approaches a stationary time-independent form for $n<1/2$. The tails of the position distribution at late times exhibit a large deviation form, $p_n(x,t)\sim \exp\left[-\gamma\, t\, \Phi_n\left(\frac{x}{x^*(t)}\right)\right]$, where $x^*(t)= v_0\, t^n/\Gamma(n+1)$. We compute the rate function $\Phi_n(z)$ analytically for all $n>0$ and also numerically using importance sampling methods, finding excellent agreement between them. For three special values $n=1$, $n=2$ and $n=1/2$ we compute the exact cumulant generating function of the position distribution at all times $t$.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,Linear and anomalous front propagation in system with non Gaussian diffusion: the importance of tails,"We investigate front propagation in systems with diffusive and sub-diffusive behavior. The scaling behavior of moments of the diffusive problem, both in the standard and in the anomalous cases, is not enough to determine the features of the reactive front. In fact, the shape of the bulk of the probability distribution of the transport process, which determines the diffusive properties, is important just for pre-asymptotic behavior of front propagation, while the precise shape of the tails of the probability distribution determines asymptotic behavior of front propagation.",cond-mat,cond-mat.stat-mech,1
Simulating solvation and acidity in complex mixtures with first-principles accuracy: the case of CH$_3$SO$_3$H and H$_2$O$_2$ in phenol,"We present a generally-applicable computational framework for the efficient and accurate characterization of molecular structural patterns and acid properties in explicit solvent using H$_2$O$_2$ and CH$_3$SO$_3$H in phenol as an example. In order to address the challenges posed by the complexity of the problem, we resort to a set of data-driven methods and enhanced sampling algorithms. The synergistic application of these techniques makes the first-principle estimation of the chemical properties feasible without renouncing to the use of explicit solvation, involving extensive statistical sampling. Ensembles of neural network potentials are trained on a set of configurations carefully selected out of preliminary simulations performed at a low-cost density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) level. The energy and forces of these configurations are then recomputed at the hybrid density functional theory (DFT) level and used to train the neural networks. The stability of the NN model is enhanced by using DFTB energetics as a baseline, but the efficiency of the direct NN (i.e., baseline-free) is exploited via a multiple-time step integrator. The neural network potentials are combined with enhanced sampling techniques, such as replica exchange and metadynamics, and used to characterize the relevant protonated species and dominant non-covalent interactions in the mixture, also considering nuclear quantum effects.",physics,physics.chem-ph,Role of enviromental dynamic polarizability in static excited state properties of embedded molecular systems: Application to disordered fluorographene systems,"We present an extension of the standard polarizable quantum mechanic/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach for treating environmental effects on excited state properties of embedded systems. A quantum polarizable atom model is derived from a full quantum description of the environment using perturbation theory for the system-environment coupling. Our model provides a more general description of the environment, including frequency dependent atomic polarizabilities, without loss of computational simplicity of the QM/MM approach. The classical polarizable atom description used in polarizable QM/MM approach can be obtained as a limiting case of the present model. This enables us to pinpoint approximations and assumptions about the system inherent to classical polarizable atom description of the environment. We apply our method to fluorographene (FG) based systems to investigate effects of the FG sheet on excited state properties of impurities on the FG surface. Comparison to full quantum chemistry calculations and to the standard polarizable QM/MM approach on disordered fluorograhene clusters reveals the importance of frequency dependence of atomic polarizabilities for the proper treatment of the effects of the environment on both the transition energy shifts and the interaction energies.",physics,physics.chem-ph,1
Optical solitons in near $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric Rosen-Morse potential,"We investigate the existence of stable soliton solution in a system described by complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation with near parity reflection - time reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric Rosen-Morse potential. In this study, the stability of solution is examined by numerical analysis to show that solitons are stable for some parameter ranges. The dynamical properties such as evolution and transverse energy flow for both self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinear mode are also analyzed. The obtained results are useful for experimental designs and applications in related fields.",nlin,nlin.PS,Stability criterion for bright solitary waves of the perturbed cubic-quintic Schroedinger equation,"The stability of the bright solitary wave solution to the perturbed cubic-quintic Schroedinger equation is considered. It is shown that in a certain region of parameter space these solutions are unstable, with the instability being manifested as a small positive eigenvalue. Furthermore, it is shown that in the complimentary region of parameter space there are no small unstable eigenvalues. The proof involves a novel calculation of the Evans function, which is of interest in its own right. As a consequence of the eigenvalue calculation, it is additionally shown that N-bump bright solitary waves bifurcate from the primary wave.",nlin,nlin.PS,1
Inexorable Edge Kondo Breakdown in Topological Kondo Insulators,"Kondo breakdown is one of the most intriguing problems in strongly correlated electron systems, as it is rooted in many anomalous electron behaviors found in heavy-fermion materials. In Kondo lattice systems, Kondo breakdown can arise from either strong magnetic frustrations or critical fluctuations of collective modes. Here, we reveal a new type of Kondo breakdown with a fully different origin in interacting topological Kondo insulators. By employing numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that with open boundary conditions, Kondo screening is inexorably destroyed by interaction effects on edges or corners in these systems. We argue that the Kondo breakdown is enforced by the symmetries of the system, because the ground states are symmetry protected Haldane phases.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,Confinement-Deconfinement Transition as an Indication of Spin-Liquid-Type Behavior in Na$_2$IrO$_3$,"We use ultrafast optical spectroscopy to observe binding of charged single-particle excitations (SE) in the magnetically frustrated Mott insulator Na$_2$IrO$_3$. Above the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature ($T_N$) the system response is due to both Hubbard excitons (HE) and their constituent unpaired SE. The SE response becomes strongly suppressed immediately below $T_N$. We argue that this increase in binding energy is due to a unique interplay between the frustrated Kitaev and the weak Heisenberg-type ordering term in the Hamiltonian, mediating an effective interaction between the spin-singlet SE. This interaction grows with distance causing the SE to become trapped in the HE, similar to quark confinement inside hadrons. This binding of charged particles, induced by magnetic ordering, is a result of a confinement-deconfinement transition of spin excitations. This observation provides evidence for spin liquid type behavior which is expected in Na$_2$IrO$_3$.",cond-mat,cond-mat.str-el,1
"Comment on ""A phenomenological $\pi^- p$ scattering length from pionic hydrogen''","This short technical note addresses a number of issues regarding the estimates of the 2004 paper by Ericson, Loiseau, and Wycech for the corrections $\delta_\epsilon$ and $\delta_\Gamma$, which aim at the removal of the effects of electromagnetic origin from the measurements of the strong-interaction shift $\epsilon_{1s}$ and of the total decay width $\Gamma_{1s}$ of the ground state in pionic hydrogen.",nucl,nucl-th,Weak Polarized Electron Scattering,"Scattering polarized electrons provides an important probe of the weak interactions. Precisely measuring the parity-violating left-right cross section asymmetry is the goal of a number of experiments recently completed or in progress. The experiments are challenging, since A_{LR} is small, typically between 10^(-4) and 10^(-8). By carefully choosing appropriate targets and kinematics, various pieces of the weak Lagrangian can be isolated, providing a search for physics beyond the Standard Model. For other choices, unique features of the strong interaction are studied, including the radius of the neutron density in heavy nuclei, charge symmetry violation, and higher twist terms. This article reviews the theory behind the experiments, as well as the general techniques used in the experimental program.",nucl,nucl-th,1
Metastable massive gravitons from an infinite extra dimension,"Motivated by stringy considerations, Randall & Sundrum have proposed a model where all the fields and particles of physics, save gravity, are confined on a 4-dimensional brane embedded in 5-dimensional anti-deSitter space. Their scenario features a stable bound state of bulk gravity waves and the brane that reproduces standard general relativity. We demonstrate that in addition to this zero-mode, there is also a discrete set of metastable bound states that behave like massive 4-dimensional gravitons which decay by tunneling into the bulk. These are resonances of the bulk-brane system akin to black hole quasinormal modes--as such, they give rise to the dominant corrections to 4-dimensional gravity. The phenomenology of braneworld perturbations is greatly simplified when these resonant modes are taken into account, which is illustrated by considering gravitational radiation emitted from nearby sources and early universe physics.",hep,hep-th,The large-N running of the spectral index of inflation,"We extend previous classifications of inflationary models by means of their behaviour at large-N, where N is the number of e-foldings. In addition to the perturbative 1/N case, whose slow-roll parameters fall off as powers of 1/N, we introduce the constant, non-perturbative and logarithmic classes. This covers the large majority of inflationary models. Furthermore, we calculate the running of the spectral tilt for all these classes. Remarkably, we find that the tilt's runnings essentially cluster around the permil level. We comment on the implications for future experiments.",hep,hep-th,1
Two-Moment Neutrino Flavor Transformation with applications to the Fast Flavor Instability in Neutron Star Mergers,"Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (MMA) has produced a wealth of data with much more to come in the future. This enormous data set will reveal new insights into the physics of Core Collapse SuperNovae (CCSN), Binary Neutron Star Mergers (BNSM), and many other objects where it is actually possible, if not probable, that new physics is in operation. To tease out different possibilities, we will need to analyze signals from photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves, and chemical elements. This task is made all the more difficult when it is necessary to evolve the neutrino component of the radiation field and associated quantum-mechanical property of flavor in order to model the astrophysical system of interest -- a numerical challenge that has not been addressed to this day. In this work, we take a step in this direction by adopting the technique of angular-integrated moments with a truncated tower of dynamical equations and a closure, convolving a flavor-transformation with spatial transport to evolve the neutrino radiation quantum field. We show that moments capture the dynamical features of Fast Flavor Instabilities (FFI) and provide comparable results to a more precise particle-in-cell method. We propose areas for improvement in the future.",astro-ph,astro-ph.HE,Follow-up of X-ray transients detected by SWIFT with COLORES using the BOOTES network,"The Burst Observer and Optical Transient Exploring System (BOOTES) is a network of telescopes that allows the continuous monitoring of transient astrophysical sources.

Compact Binaries in Star Clusters I - Black Hole Binaries Inside Globular Clusters,"We study the compact binary population in star clusters, focusing on binaries containing black holes, using a self-consistent Monte Carlo treatment of dynamics and full stellar evolution. We find that the black holes experience strong mass segregation and become centrally concentrated. In the core the black holes interact strongly with each other and black hole-black hole binaries are formed very efficiently. The strong interactions, however, also destroy or eject the black hole-black hole binaries. We find no black hole-black hole mergers within our simulations but produce many hard escapers that will merge in the galactic field within a Hubble time. We also find several highly eccentric black hole-black hole binaries that are potential LISA sources, suggesting that star clusters are interesting targets for space-based detectors. We conclude that star clusters must be taken into account when predicting compact binary population statistics.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,Energy conversion rate of an active region transient brightening estimated by a spectroscopic observation of Hinode,"We statistically estimate the conversion rate of the energy released during an active-region transient brightening to Doppler motion and thermal and non-thermal energies. We used two types of datasets for the energy estimation and detection of transient brightenings. One includes spectroscopic images of Fe xiv, Fe xv, and Fe xvi lines observed by the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer. The other includes images obtained from the 211 \AA channel of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The observed active region was NOAA 11890 on November 09, 2013, and the day after that. As a result, the released Doppler motion and non-thermal energies were found to be approximately 0.1 \-- 1% and 10 \-- 100% of the change in the amount of thermal energy in each enhancement, respectively. Using this conversion rate, we estimated the contribution of the total energy flux of AIA transient brightenings to the active region heating to be at most 2% of the conduction and radiative losses.",astro-ph,astro-ph.SR,1
Dielectric properties and lattice dynamics of Ca-doped K$_{0.95}$Li$_{0.05}$TaO$_{3}$,"Relaxor behavior and lattice dynamics have been studied for a single crystal of K$_{1-x}$Li$_x$TaO$_3$ $(x=0.05)$, where a small amount of a Ca impurity ($\sim 15$~ppm) was incorporated. The dielectric measurements revealed Debye-like relaxations with Arrhenius activation energies of 80 and 240 meV that are assigned to Li$^+$ dipoles and the Li$^+$-Li$^+$ dipolar pairs, respectively. In the neutron scattering results, diffuse scattering ridges appear around the nuclear Bragg peaks below $\sim 150$ K and phonon line broadening features start to appear at even higher temperatures suggesting that polar nano-regions (PNR's) start to form at these temperatures. These results are supported by the dielectric data that reveal relaxor behavior starting at $\sim 200$ K on cooling. From analyses of the diffuse intensities, the displacements include a uniform phase shift of all of the atoms in addition to the atomic displacements corresponding to a polarization vector of the transverse optic soft ferroelectric mode, a finding that is analogous to that in the prototypical relaxor material Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$.",cond-mat,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"Valence and spin states in perovskites LaCo0.95M0.05O3 (M = Mg, Ga, Ti)","The samples LaCoO3 with dilute substitutions on cobalt sites have been studied using the resistivity, thermopower and magnetic susceptibility measurements over the temperature range up to ~900 K. The Co-site substitution does not affect the magnetic transition at ~100 K and the onset of massive population of hole carriers at ~500 K, characteristic for undoped LaCoO3. On the other hand, the low-temperature transport and magnetism is markedly distinct for samples with extra charge on cobalt ions introduced by the heterovalent dopants (Mg2+, Ti4+) compared to samples with minor non-stoichiometry (LaCoO3, Ga3+ doped sample). Magnetic properties suggest that these extra charges create thermally stable magnetic polarons of total S ~ 2-3.

On the absolute value of the air-fluorescence yield,"The absolute value of the air-fluorescence yield is a key parameter for the energy reconstruction of extensive air showers registered by fluorescence telescopes. In previous publications, we reported a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the air-fluorescence generation that allowed the theoretical evaluation of this parameter. This simulation has been upgraded in the present work. As a result, we determined an updated absolute value of the fluorescence yield of 7.9+-2.0 ph/MeV for the band at 337 nm in dry air at 800 hPa and 293 K, in agreement with experimental values. We have also performed a critical analysis of available absolute measurements of the fluorescence yield with the assistance of our simulation. Corrections have been applied to some measurements to account for a bias in the evaluation of the energy deposition. Possible effects of other experimental aspects have also been discussed. From this analysis, we determined an average fluorescence yield of 7.04+-0.24 ph/MeV at the above conditions.",astro-ph,astro-ph.IM,IVOA Recommendation: Maintenance of the list of UCD words Version 1.20,"According to what is stated in the IVOA Recommendation ""An IVOA standard for Unified Content Descriptors"", a procedural document should be created in order to maintain (add, change, suppress words) the standard list of UCD1+ words ""The UCD1+ Controlled Vocabulary"".
