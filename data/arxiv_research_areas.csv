On Raynal's posting in arXiv (nucl-th/0407060),Three-body Halos. IV. Momentum Distributions after Fragmentation,True,"With nucl-th/0407060, Jacques Raynal uses the arXiv in a way which does not conform to standard professional practices. His posting contains many statements that are beyond the borders of acceptable scientific disputes, with the scope to defame colleagues by manifestly false or misleading statements. In this comment we reject the three ``critiques'' expressed by Raynal. 1. The fact that we possibly misquoted our references. 2. The role of the Pauli principle in these kind of calculations. 3. The nature and limits of our coupled-channel potential model. Raynal's postings unfairly detract from the importance of our work, which we published in Nuclear Physics A728, 65 (2003), on a new approach, Multi-Channel-Algebraic-Scattering (MCAS), for coupled-channel calculations. With the MCAS approach we were able to identify systematically all low-energy compound resonances, and to include effectively the Pauli principle in collective, geometrical-type, macroscopic models of multichannel interaction. This represents a clear advantage with respect to the current distribution of the ECIS formulation.",Momentum distributions of particles from nuclear break-up of fast three-body halos are calculated incorporating effects of final state interactions. The same two-body interactions between the particles are used to calculate both the ground state structure and the final state of the reaction processes. The ground state wave function reproduces size and energy of the halo nucleus. First we give a general and detailed description of the method. Then we investigate the effect of final state interactions in neutron removal and core break-up reactions for one- and two-dimensional momentum distributions. We compute specifically core and neutron momentum distributions from 11Li fragmentation and compare those with available experimental data. We conclude that 11Li must have a neutron-core relative state containing a p-state admixture of 20\%-30\%. The fragmentation data also strongly suggest that 10Li has an s-state at about 50 keV and a p-state around 500 keV.,Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

Mid-Infrared Imaging of Nearby Radio-Loud AGN,Small scale clustering of late forming dark matter,True,"We present high spatial resolution MIR observations for several nearby radio loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGN), which were obtained using the Gemini North and South telescopes. Of the six observed objects, we detected five in the Si-2 (8.7 microns) and Si-6 (12.3 microns) filters, of which two objects show some evidence of low level extended emission surrounding the unresolved nucleus. In Pictor A, we also obtained an image in Qs (18.3 microns) that has a flux of only half that seen in the Spitzer image, suggesting structure on arcsecond scales. We also used the Si-6 (12.3 microns) flux measurement to investigate correlation between our MIR flux and xray luminosity and compare this to results for AGN in general. This work also forms a basis for future high resolution imaging and spectroscopy of these objects.","We perform a study of the nonlinear clustering of matter in the late-forming dark matter (LFDM) scenario in which dark matter results from the transition of a nonminimally coupled scalar field from radiation to collisionless matter. A distinct feature of this model is the presence of a damped oscillatory cutoff in the linear matter power spectrum at small scales. We use a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations to study the imprints of LFDM on the nonlinear matter power spectrum, the halo mass and velocity functions and the halo density profiles. The model largely satisfies high-redshift matter power spectrum constraints from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements, while it predicts suppressed abundance of low-mass halos ($\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_\odot$) at all redshifts compared to a vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model. The analysis of the LFDM halo velocity function shows a better agreement than the $\Lambda$CDM prediction with the observed abundance of low-velocity galaxies in the local volume. Halos with mass $M\gtrsim 10^{11}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_\odot$ show minor departures of the density profiles from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, while smaller-mass halos are less dense, consistent with the fact that they form later than their $\Lambda$CDM counterparts.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Coulomb field correction due to virtual $e^+e^-$ production in heavy ion collisions,Impact of Multiplicity Fluctuations on Entropy Scaling Across System Size,True,"The correction to the Coulomb energy due to virtual production of $e^+e^-$ pairs, which is on the order of one percent of the Coulomb energy at nuclear scales is discussed. The effects of including a pair-production term in the semi-empirical mass formula and the correction to the Coulomb barrier for a handful of nuclear collisions using the Bass and Coulomb potentials are studied. With an eye toward future work using Constrained Molecular Dynamics (CoMD) model, we also calculate the correction to the Coulomb energy and force between protons after folding with a Gaussian spatial distribution.","The initial state is one of the greatest uncertainties in heavy-ion collisions. A model-agnostic approach is taken in the phenomenological Trento framework which constrains parameters using Bayesian analysis. However, the color-glass condensate (CGC) effective theory predicts initial energy densities that lie outside the recent Bayesian analyses due, in part, to the assumption in Trento of event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations following a $\Gamma$ distribution. We compare the Trento-preferred $\sqrt{T_{A}T_{B}}$ scaling to CGC-like $T_{A}T_{B}$ scaling coupled with log-normal fluctuations in $AuAu$ and $dAu$ collisions and find there is a significant impact on the multiplicity distributions and on the eccentricities, which may affect the extraction of viscosity in small systems.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Direct micro-structuring of Si(111) surfaces through nanosecond-laser Bessel beams,Ultrashort pulse generation from a graphene-coupled passively mode-locked terahertz laser,True,"We present here a nanosecond laser ablation of Si(111) wafer with diffraction-free (Bessel-$J_0$) beams. First, the Axicon a conical shaped optical element for beam shaping is characterized with a visible and infrared light sources. Then, ablation profiles are obtained with Bessel beams generated for $\alpha=1^{\circ}$ and $\alpha=20^{\circ}$ base angles, then they are characterized via a Scanning Electron, an Atomic Force and an Optical Interferometric Microscopes. Experimental results compared with theoretical predictions obtained by using Bessel functions. Results show that Bessel beams give possibility of straightforward micro-structuring of Si(111) samples because the only central spot of Bessel beams could damage the surface provided that the laser pulse energy becomes in energy-range we found in our experiments. Moreover, our results clearly indicate that reduced HAZ area due to thermal expansion in ns pulse regime are natural outcome of Bessel beams as opposed to Gauss beams of same spot size. Lastly, nanosecond pulses indicate two-ablation regimes regarding the pulse energy, the quality of structures can be enhanced by using high quality Gauss beams ($M^{2}\approx1$) and the size of fabricated structures can be much reduced by using larger base angle of Axicon (such as $\alpha=40^{\circ}$) in our scheme.","The generation of stable trains of ultra-short (fs-ps), terahertz (THz)-frequency radiation pulses, with large instantaneous intensities, is an underpinning requirement for the investigation of light-matter interactions, for metrology and for ultra-high-speed communications. In solid-state electrically-pumped lasers, the primary route for generating short pulses is through passive mode-locking. However, this has not yet been achieved in the THz range, defining one of the longest standing goals over the last two decades. In fact, the realization of passive mode-locking has long been assumed to be inherently hindered by the fast recovery times associated with the intersubband gain of THz lasers. Here, we demonstrate a self-starting miniaturized ultra-short pulse THz laser, exploiting an original device architecture that includes the surface patterning of multilayer-graphene saturable absorbers distributed along the entire cavity of a double-metal semiconductor 2.30-3.55 THz wire laser. Self-starting pulsed emission with 4.0-ps-long pulses in a compact, all-electronic, all-passive and inexpensive configuration is demonstrated.",Optics,Optics in physics focuses on adaptive optics.

Comment on: ``Trace anomaly of dilaton coupled scalars in two dimensions'',"Generalized Uncertainty Principle, Extra-dimensions and Holography",True,The trace anomaly for nonminimally coupled scalars in spherically reduced gravity obtained by Bousso and Hawking (hep-th/9705236) is incorrect. We explain the reasons for the deviations from our correct (published) result which is supported by several other recent papers.,"We consider Uncertainty Principles which take into account the role of gravity and the possible existence of extra spatial dimensions.

Why the overlap formula does not lead to chiral fermions,Scaling limit of the one-dimensional attractive Hubbard model: The non-half-filled band case,True,"We describe a conceptually simple, but important test for the overlap approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories. We explain the equivalence of the overlap formula with a certain waveguide model for a simple set of gauge configurations (the trivial orbit). This equivalence is helpful in carrying out the test, and casts serious doubts on the viability of the overlap approach. A recent note by Narayanan and Neuberger which points out a mistake in our previous work is irrelevant in this context.","The scaling limit of the less than half filled attractive Hubbard chain is studied. This is a continuum limit in which the particle number per lattice site, n, is kept finite (0<n<1) while adjusting the interaction and bandwidth in a such way that there is a finite mass gap. We construct this limit both for the spectrum and the secular equations describing the excitations. We find, that similarly to the half filled case, the limiting model has a massive and a massless sector. The structure of the massive sector is closely analogous to that of the half filled band and consequently to the chiral invariant SU(2) Gross-Neveu (CGN) model. The structure of the massless sector differs from that of the half filled band case: the excitations are of particle and hole type, however they are not uniquely defined. The energy and the momentum of this sector exhibits a tower structure corresponding to a conformal field theory with c=1 and SU(2)xSU(2) symmetry. The energy-momentum spectrum and the zero temperature free energy of the states with finite density coincides with that of the half filled case supporting the identification of the limiting model with the SU(2) symmetric CGN theory.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Evolution of Primordial Magnetic Fields from Phase Transitions,Testing Modified Newtonian dynamics through statistics of velocity dispersion profiles in the inner regions of elliptical galaxies,True,"We consider the evolution of primordial magnetic fields generated during cosmological, electroweak or QCD, phase transitions. We assume that the magnetic field generation can be described as an injection of magnetic energy to cosmological plasma at a given scale determined by the moment of magnetic field generation. A high Reynolds number ensures strong coupling between magnetic field and fluid motions. The subsequent evolution of the magnetic field is governed by decaying hydromagnetic turbulence. Both our numerical simulations and a phenomenological description allow us to recover ""universal"" laws for the decay of magnetic energy and the growth of magnetic correlation length in the turbulent (low viscosity) regime. In particular, we show that during the radiation dominated epoch, energy and correlation length of non-helical magnetic fields scale as conformal time to the powers -1/2 and +1/2, respectively. For helical magnetic fields, energy and correlation length scale as conformal time to the powers -1/3 and +2/3, respectively. The universal decay law of the magnetic field implies that the strength of magnetic field generated during the QCD phase transition could reach $\sim 10^{-9}$\,G with the present day correlation length $\sim 50$ kpc. The fields generated at the electroweak phase transition could be as strong as $\sim 10^{-10}$ G with correlation lengths reaching $\sim 0.3$\,kpc. These values of the magnetic fields are consistent with the lower bounds of the extragalactic magnetic fields.","Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) provides a paradigm alternative to dark matter that has been successful in fitting and predicting the rich phenomenology of rotating disc galaxies. There have also been attempts to test MOND in dispersion-supported early-type galaxies, but it remains unclear whether MOND can fit the various empirical properties of early-type galaxies. As a way of rigorously testing MOND in elliptical galaxies we calculate the MOND-predicted velocity dispersion profiles (VDPs) in the inner regions of $\sim 2000$ nearly round SDSS elliptical galaxies under a variety of assumptions on VD anisotropy, and then compare the predicted distribution of VDP slopes with the observed distribution in 11 ATLAS3d galaxies selected with essentially the same criteria. We find that the MOND model parameterised with an interpolating function that works well for rotating galaxies can also reproduce the observed distribution of VDP slopes based only on the observed stellar mass distribution without DM or any other galaxy-to-galaxy varying factor. This is remarkable in view that Newtonian dynamics with DM requires a specific amount and/or profile of DM for each galaxy in order to reproduce the observed distribution of VDP slopes. When we analyse non-round galaxy samples using the MOND-based spherical Jeans equation, we do not find any systematic difference in the mean property of the VDP slope distribution compared with the nearly round sample. However, in line with previous studies of MOND through individual analyses of elliptical galaxies, varying MOND interpolating function or VD anisotropy can lead to systematic change in the VDP slope distribution, indicating that a statistical analysis of VDPs can be used to constrain specific MOND models with an accurate measurement of VDP slopes or a prior constraint on VD anisotropy.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

The Interfacial Structure of InP(100) in Contact with HCl and H$_2$SO$_4$ studied by Reflection Anisotropy Spectroscopy,A Review of Liquid Phase Epitaxial Grown Gallium Arsenide,True,"Indium phosphide and derived compound semiconductors are materials often involved in high-efficiency solar water splitting due to their versatile opto-electronic properties. Surface corrosion, however, typically deteriorates the performance of photoelectrochemical solar cells based on this material class. It has been reported that (photo)electrochemical surface functionalisation protects the surface by combining etching and controlled corrosion. Nevertheless, the overall involved process is not fully understood. Therefore, access to the electrochemical interface structure under operando conditions is crucial for a more detailed understanding. One approach for gaining structural insight is the use of operando reflection anisotropy spectroscopy. This technique allows the time-resolved investigation of the interfacial structure while applying potentials in the electrolyte. In this study, p-doped InP(100) surfaces are cycled between anodic and cathodic potentials in two different electrolytes, hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid. For low, 10 mM electrolyte concentrations, we observe a reversible processes related to the reduction of a surface oxide phase in the cathodic potential range which is reformed near open-circuit potentials. Higher concentrations of 0.5 N, however, already lead to initial surface corrosion.","Liquid phase epitaxy of gallium arsenide (LPE GaAs) has been investigated intensively from the late 1960's to the present and has now a special place in the manufacture of wide band, compound semiconductor radiation detectors. Although this particular process appears to have gained prominence in the last three decades, it is interesting to note that its origins reach back to 1836 when Frankenheim made his first observations.

Composite Mediators and Lorentz Violation,"Renormalization, Hopf algebras and Mellin transforms",True,"We briefly review the history and current status of models of particle interactions in which massless mediators are given, not by fundamental gauge fields as in the Standard Model, but by composite degrees of freedom of fermionic systems. Such models generally require the breaking of Lorentz invariance. We describe schemes in which the photon and the graviton emerge as Goldstone bosons from the breaking of Lorentz invariance, as well as generalizations of the quantum Hall effect in which composite excitations yield massless particles of all integer spins. While these schemes are of limited interest for the photon (spin 1), in the case of the graviton (spin 2) they offer a possible solution to the long-standing UV problem in quantum linear gravity.","This article aims to give a short introduction into Hopf-algebraic aspects of renormalization, enjoying growing attention for more than a decade by now. As most available literature is concerned with the minimal subtraction scheme, we like to point out properties of the kinematic subtraction scheme which is also widely used in physics (under the names of MOM or BPHZ). In particular we relate renormalized Feynman rules $\phi_R$ in this scheme to the universal property of the Hopf algebra $H_R$ of rooted trees, exhibiting a refined renormalization group equation which is equivalent to $\phi_R: H_R \rightarrow K[x]$ being a morphism of Hopf algebras to the polynomials in one indeterminate. Upon introduction of analytic regularization this results in efficient combinatorial recursions to calculate $\phi_R$ in terms of the Mellin transform. We find that different Feynman rules are related by a distinguished class of Hopf algebra automorphisms of $H_R$ that arise naturally from Hochschild cohomology. Also we recall the known results for the minimal subtraction scheme and shed light on the interrelationship of both schemes. Finally we incorporate combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations to study the effects of renormalization on the physical meaningful correlation functions. This yields a precise formulation of the equivalence of the two different renormalization prescriptions mentioned before and allows for non-perturbative definitions of quantum field theories in special cases.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

ARPES and optical renormalizations: phonons or spin fluctuations,"Fermi-surface-free superconductivity in underdoped (Bi,Pb)$_{2}$(Sr,La)$_{2}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Bi2201)",True,"Improved resolution in both, energy and momentum in ARPES-data has lead to the establishment of a definite energy scale in the dressed quasiparticle dispersion relations. The observed structure around 80 meV has been taken as evidence for coupling to phonons and has re-focused the debate about the mechanism of superconductivity in the cuprates. Here we address the relative merits of phonon as opposed to spin fluctuation mechanisms. Both possibilities are consistent with ARPES. On the other hand, when considerations are extended to infrared optical data, a spin fluctuation mechanism provides a more natural interpretation of the combined sets of data in Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta} (Bi2212).","We show that hole-doped cuprates can harbor {\it Fermi-surface-free superconductivity} similar to the case of the pnictides. This occurs near the doping at which a new Fermi surface pocket appears in the antinodal region. The change in Fermi surface topology is accompanied by a characteristic rise in spectral weight.

Heavy quark production and spectroscopy at HERA,"Production of pi+, pi-, K+, K-, p and p-bar in Light (uds), c and b Jets from Z0 Decays",True,Heavy flavour production and spectroscopy are key components of the HERA physics programme. I will summarise a selection of the recent results obtained by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations. The production of excited charm mesons and J/psi will be discussed as well as measurements of b quark cross-sections in photoproduction. The status of searches for exotic bound states and the D*p resonance will be updated.,"We present improved measurements of the differential production rates of stable charged particles in hadronic Z0 decays, and of charged pions, kaons and protons identified over a wide momentum range using the SLD Cherenkov Ring Imaging Detector. In addition to flavor-inclusive Z0 decays, measurements are made for Z0 decays into light (u, d, s), c and b primary flavors, selected using the upgraded Vertex Detector. Large differences between the flavors are observed that are qualitatively consistent with expectations based upon previously measured production and decay properties of heavy hadrons. These results are used to test the predictions of QCD in the Modified Leading Logarithm Approximation, with the ansatz of Local Parton-Hadron Duality, and the predictions of three models of the hadronization process. The light-flavor results provide improved tests of these predictions, as they do not include the contribution of heavy-hadron production and decay; the heavy-flavor results provide complementary model tests. In addition we have compared hadron and antihadron production in light quark (as opposed to antiquark) jets. Differences are observed at high momentum for all three charged hadron species, providing direct probes of leading particle effects, and stringent constraints on models.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Triangular pair density wave in confined superfluid $^3$He,Untying the insulating and superconducting orders in magic-angle graphene,True,"Recent advances in experiment and theory suggest that superfluid $^3$He under planar confinement may form a pair density wave (PDW) whereby superfluid and crystalline orders coexist. While a natural candidate for this phase is a unidirectional stripe phase predicted by Vorontsov and Sauls in 2007, recent nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of the superfluid order parameter rather suggest a two-dimensional PDW with noncollinear wavevectors, of possibly square or hexagonal symmetry. In this Letter, we present a general mechanism by which a PDW with the symmetry of a triangular lattice can be stabilized, based on a superfluid generalization of Landau's theory of the liquid-solid transition. A soft-mode instability at finite wavevector within the translationally invariant planar-distorted B phase triggers a transition from uniform superfluid to PDW that is first order due to a cubic term generally present in the PDW free-energy functional. This cubic term also lifts the degeneracy of possible PDW states in favor of those for which wavevectors add to zero in triangles, which in two dimensions uniquely selects the triangular lattice.","The coexistence of superconducting and correlated insulating states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene prompts fascinating questions about the relationship of these orders. Independent control of the microscopic mechanisms governing these phases could help uncover their individual roles and shed light on their intricate interplay. Here we report on direct tuning of electronic interactions in this system by changing its separation from a metallic screening layer. We observe quenching of correlated insula-tors in devices with screening layer separations that are smaller than a typical Wannier orbital size of 15nm, and with the twist angles slightly deviating from the magic value 1.10 plus(minus) 0.05 degrees. Upon extinction of the insulating orders, the vacated phase space is taken over by superconducting domes that feature critical temperatures comparable to those in the devices with strong insulators. In addition, we find that insulators at half-filling can reappear in small out-of-plane magnetic fields of 0.4 T, giving rise to quantized Hall states with a Chern number of 2. Our study suggests reexamination of the often-assumed mother-child relation between the insulating and superconducting phases in moire graphene, and illustrates a new approach to directly probe microscopic mechanisms of superconductivity in strongly-correlated systems.",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

Giant thermal magnetoresistance in plasmonic structures,Investigating transverse Hall conductances using two-terminal setups,True,"A giant thermal magnetoresistance is predicted for the electromagnetic transport of heat in magneto-optical plasmonic structures. In chains of InSb-Ag nanoparticles at room temperature, we found that the resistance can be increased by almost a factor of 2 with magnetic fields of 2 T. We show that this important change results from the strong spectral dependence of localized surface waves on the magnitude of the magnetic field.","In this paper we present a method to numerically study transverse Hall conductances using a two-terminal setup. Using nonlinear transport concepts we find that the Hall voltage dependence on the model parameters can be investigated from the difference between the injectivities from each terminal. The method is suitable to work with non-equilibrium Green's functions as well as for scattering matrix approaches. We illustrate the proposed idea by studying the quantum spin Hall effect in graphene with disordered spin-orbit scattering centers induced by adatoms.

Spontaneous Formation of Double Emulsions at Particle-Laden Interfaces,Single-bubble and multi-bubble cavitation in water triggered by laser-driven focusing shock waves,True,"Double emulsions, due to their compartmental structures, are essential in food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical applications. Traditionally, double emulsifications rely on the presence of both oil-soluble and water-soluble surfactants or external stimuli responsive materials and require sequential droplet formation settings or unique fluidic designs. We report on unusual phenomenon where double emulsions are spontaneously formed as soon an aqueous nanoparticle dispersion is placed in contact with an oleic micellar solution. Nanoscale water droplets nucleate in oil in the form of swollen micelles. Nanoparticles form a water-shell encapsulating the saturated oil phase with swollen micelles over time. Remarkably, we find that the gradual surface-activation of nanoparticles is key in self-double emulsification and controlling the emulsion intensity. We build on this new discovery and design a novel system for double emulsion formation. This approach is a scalable self-sequential strategy for preparing core-shell double emulsions that disperses nanoparticles in the opposite phase by employing micelles as transport vehicles. Incorporating nanoparticles into spontaneous emulsification systems opens novel routes for designing emulsion-based materials.","In this study a single laser pulse spatially shaped into a ring is focused into a thin water layer, creating an annular cavitation bubble and cylindrical shock waves: an outer shock that diverges away from the excitation laser ring and an inner shock that focuses towards the center. A few nanoseconds after the converging shock reaches the focus and diverges away from the center, a single bubble nucleates at the center. The inner diverging shock then reaches the surface of the annular laser-induced bubble and reflects at the boundary, initiating nucleation of a tertiary bubble cloud. In the present experiments, we have performed time-resolved imaging of shock propagation and bubble wall motion. Our experimental observations of single-bubble cavitation and collapse and appearance of ring-shaped bubble clouds are consistent with our numerical simulations that solve a one dimensional Euler equation in cylindrical coordinates. The numerical results agree qualitatively with the experimental observations of the appearance and growth of bubble clouds at the smallest laser excitation rings.

Comments on the nuclear symmetry energy,"Comment on ""Direct Observation of Proton Emission in $^{11}$Be""",True,"According to standard textbooks, the nuclear symmetry energy originates from the {\it kinetic} energy and the {\it interaction} itself. We argue that this view requires certain modifications. We ascribe the physical origin of the {\it kinetic} term to the discreteness of fermionic levels of, in principle arbitrary binary fermionic systems, and relate its mean value directly to the average level density. Physically it connects this part also to the isoscalar part of the interaction which, at least in self-bound systems like atomic nuclei, decides upon the spatial dimensions of the system. For the general case of binary fermionic systems possible external confining potentials as well as specific boundary conditions will contribute to this part. The reliability of this concept is tested using self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculations.","We argue that conclusions of [PRL 123, 082501 (2019)] are incorrect. The authors present the direct observation of beta-delayed proton emission in the beta decay of 11Be. From the determined branching ratio for this process and from the energy spectrum of emitted protons the existence of a so far unobserved narrow resonance in 11Be was deduced. The given beta strength for the transition to this state is however wrong. In addition, we show that the combination of peak position and branching ratio is in strong disagreement with models considered by the authors.

Cosmological and Astrophysical Implications of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect,E and B families of the Stokes parameters in the polarized synchrotron and thermal dust foregrounds,True,"The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect provides a useful probe of cosmology and structure formation in the Universe. Recent years have seen rapid progress in both quality and quantity of its measurements. In this review, we overview cosmological and astrophysical implications of recent and near future observations of the effect. They include measuring the evolution of the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature, the distance-redshift relation out to high redshifts, number counts and power spectra of galaxy clusters, distributions and dynamics of intracluster plasma, and large-scale motions of the Universe.","Better understanding of Galactic foregrounds is one of the main obstacles to detection of primordial gravitational waves through measurement of the B mode in the polarized microwave sky. We generalize the method proposed in \cite{2011PhRvD..83h3003B} and decompose the polarization signals into the E and B families directly in the domain of the Stokes $Q$, $U$ parameters as $(Q,U)\equiv(Q_E, U_E)+(Q_B,U_B)$. This also enables an investigation of the morphology and the frequency dependence of these two families, which has been done in the WMAP K, Ka (tracing synchrotron emission) and Planck 2015 HFI maps (tracing thermal dust). The results reveal significant differences in spectra between the E and B families. The spectral index of the E family fluctuates less across the sky than that of the B family, and the same tendency occurs for the polarization angles of the dust and synchrotron channels. The new insight from WMAP and Planck data on the North Polar Spur and BICEP2 zones through our method clearly indicates that these zones are characterized by very low polarization intensity of the B family compared to the E family. We have detected global structure of the B family polarization angles at high Galactic latitudes which cannot be attributed to the cosmic microwave background or instrumental noise.

This systematic approach takes advantage of all useful data contained in the dataset. It includes finding Brillouin zones where specific phonons have the highest scattering intensity, background subtraction, combining statistics in multiple Brillouin zones, and separating closely spaced phonon peaks. Using the software reduces the time needed to determine phonon dispersions, linewidths, and eigenvectors by more than an order of magnitude.",In contrary to widely spread view about the substantial delocalization of f electrons in heavy- fermion (h-f) compounds it is argued that h-f phenomena can be understood with localized f electrons. Then the role of crystal-field interactions is essential and the heavy-fermion behaviour can occur for the localized Kramers-doublet ground state.,Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Constraining the strength of $U(1)_A$ symmetry breaking using 2-flavour non-local NJL model,Statistical Error analysis of Nucleon-Nucleon phenomenological potentials,True,"In presence of magnetic field we have done a systematic analysis to constrain the strength of 't Hooft determinant term using LQCD data within a non-local version of two flavour NJL model. Topological susceptibility, being related to the axial symmetry, have also been calculated and compared with LQCD results to further validate our calculation.","Nucleon-Nucleon potentials are commonplace in nuclear physics and are determined from a finite number of experimental data with limited precision sampling the scattering process. We study the statistical assumptions implicit in the standard least squares fitting procedure and apply, along with more conventional tests, a tail sensitive quantile-quantile test as a simple and confident tool to verify the normality of residuals. We show that the fulfilment of normality tests is linked to a judicious and consistent selection of a nucleon-nucleon database. These considerations prove crucial to a proper statistical error analysis and uncertainty propagation. We illustrate these issues by analyzing about 8000 proton-proton and neutron-proton scattering published data.

Flavor structure of the baryon-baryon interaction from lattice QCD,Elastic scattering measurements for the $^{10}$C + $^{208}$Pb system at E$_{\rm lab}$ = 66 MeV,True,"We investigate baryon-baryon (BB) interactions in the 3-flavor full QCD simulations with degenerate quark masses for all flavors. The BB potentials in the orbital S-wave are extracted from the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter wave functions measured on the lattice. We observe strong flavor-spin dependences of the BB potentials at short distances. In particular, a strong repulsive core exists in the flavor-octet and spin-singlet channel(the 8_s representation), while an attractive core appears in the flavor singlet channel (the 1 representation). We discuss the relation of such flavor-spin dependence with the Pauli exclusion principle at the quark level. The possible existence of an H-dibaryon resonance above the Lambda-Lambda threshold is also discussed.","Background: The influence of halo structure of $^6$He, $^8$B, $^{11}$Be and $^{11}$Li nuclei in several mechanisms such as direct reactions and fusion is already established, although not completely understood. The influence of the $^{10}$C Brunnian structure is less known. Purpose: To investigate the influence of the cluster configuration of $^{10}$C on the elastic scattering at an energy close to the Coulomb barrier. Methods: We present experimental data for the elastic scattering of the $^{10}$C+$^{208}$Pb system at $E_{\rm lab}$ = 66 MeV. The data are compared to the three- and the four-body continuum-discretized coupled-channels calculations assuming $^9$B+$p$, $^6$Be+$\alpha$ and $^8$Be+$p$+$p$ configurations. Results: The experimental angular distribution of the cross sections shows the suppression of the Fresnel peak that is reasonably well reproduced by the continuum-discretized coupled-channels calculations. However, the calculations underestimate the cross sections at backward angles. Couplings to continuum states represent a small effect. Conclusions: The cluster configurations of $^{10}$C assumed in the present work are able to describe some of the features of the data. In order to explain the data at backward angles, experimental data for the breakup and an extension of theoretical formalism towards a four-body cluster seem to be in need to reproduce the measured angular distribution.",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

Luminosity of young Jupiters revisited. Massive cores make hot planets,Hidden Worlds: Dynamical Architecture Predictions of Undetected Planets in Multi-planet Systems and Applications to TESS Systems,True,"The intrinsic luminosity of young Jupiters is of high interest for planet formation theory. It is an observable quantity that is determined by important physical mechanisms during formation, namely the accretion shock structure, and even more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or gravitational instability). We study the impact of the core mass on the post-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core accretion with a supercritical shock (cold accretion). For this, we conduct self-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets with masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120 Earth masses. We find that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant planets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase of the core mass by a factor 6 results in an increase of the post-formation luminosity of a 10 Jovian mass planet by a factor 120. Due to this dependency, there is no single well defined post-formation luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range. For massive cores (~100 Earth masses), the post-formation luminosities of core accretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start scenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the mechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or during gas runaway accretion, and that they sink deep into the planet. We make no claims whether or not such massive cores can actually form in giant planets. But if yes, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as formation mechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more luminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational instability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity could also be caused simply by a more massive core.","Multi-planet systems produce a wealth of information for exoplanet science, but our understanding of planetary architectures is incomplete. Probing these systems further will provide insight into orbital architectures and formation pathways. Here we present a model to predict previously undetected planets in these systems via population statistics. The model considers both transiting and non-transiting planets, and can test the addition of more than one planet. Our tests show the model's orbital period predictions are robust to perturbations in system architectures on the order of a few percent, much larger than current uncertainties. Applying it to the multi-planet systems from TESS provides a prioritized list of targets, based on predicted transit depth and probability, for archival searches and for guiding ground-based follow-up observations hunting for hidden planets.",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"Earth and planetary astrophysics focuses on interplanetary medium, planetary physics, planetary astrobiology, extrasolar planets, comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

Molecular studies of Planetary Nebulae,"Statistical Prediction of [CII] Observations by Constructing Probability Density Functions using SOFIA, Herschel, and Spitzer Observations",True,"Circumstellar envelopes (CEs) around evolved stars are an active site for the production of molecules. After evolving through the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), proto-planetary nebula (PPN), to planetary nebula (PN) phases, CEs ultimately merge with the interstellar medium (ISM). The study of molecules in PNe, therefore, is essential to understanding the transition from stellar to interstellar materials. So far, over 20 molecular species have been discovered in PNe. The molecular composition of PNe is rather different from those of AGB and PPNe, suggesting that the molecules synthesized in PN progenitors have been heavily processed by strong ultraviolet radiation from the central star. Intriguingly, fullerenes and complex organic compounds having aromatic and aliphatic structures can be rapidly formed and largely survive during the PPN/PN evolution. The similar molecular compositions in PNe and diffuse clouds as well as the detection of C$_{60}^+$ in the ISM reinforce the view that the mass-loss from PNe can significantly enrich the ISM with molecular species, some of which may be responsible for the diffuse interstellar bands. In this contribution, I briefly summarize some recent observations of molecules in PNe, with emphasis on their implications on circumstellar chemistry.","We present a statistical algorithm for predicting the [CII] emission from Herschel and Spitzer continuum images using probability density functions between the [CII] emission and continuum emission. The [CII] emission at 158 $\mu$m is a critical tracer in studying the life cycle of interstellar medium and galaxy evolution. Unfortunately, its frequency is in the far infrared (FIR), which is opaque through the troposphere and cannot be observed from the ground except for highly red-shifted sources (z $\gtrsim$ 2). Typically [CII] observations of closer regions have been carried out using suborbital or space observatories. Given the high cost of these facilities and limited time availability, it is important to have highly efficient observations/operations in terms of maximizing science returns. This requires accurate prediction of the strength of emission lines and, therefore, the time required for their observation. However, [CII] emission has been hard to predict due to a lack of strong correlations with other observables. Here we adopt a new approach to making accurate predictions of [CII] emission by relating this emission simultaneously to several tracers of dust emission in the same region. This is done using a statistical methodology utilizing probability density functions (PDFs) among [CII] emission and Spitzer IRAC and Herschel PACS/SPIRE images. Our test result toward a star-forming region, RCW 120, demonstrates that our methodology delivers high-quality predictions with less than 30\% uncertainties over 80\% of the entire observation area, which is more than sufficient to test observation feasibility and maximize science return.

Disorder-induced rippled phases and multicriticality in free-standing graphene,Characterizing multi-mode nonlinear dynamics of nanomechanical resonators,True,"One of the most exciting phenomena observed in crystalline disordered membranes, including a suspended graphene, is rippling, i.e. a formation of static flexural deformations. Despite an active research, it still remains unclear whether the rippled phase exists in the thermodynamic limit, or it is destroyed by thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that a sufficiently strong short-range disorder stabilizes ripples, whereas in the case of a weak disorder the thermal flexural fluctuations dominate in the thermodynamic limit. The phase diagram of the disordered suspended graphene contains two separatrices: the crumpling transition line dividing the flat and crumpled phases and the rippling transition line demarking the rippled and clean phases. At the intersection of the separatrices there is the unstable, multicritical point which splits up all four phases. Most remarkably, rippled and clean flat phases are described by a single stable fixed point which belongs to the rippling transition line. Coexistence of two flat phases in the single point is possible due to non-analiticity in corresponding renormalization group equations and reflects non-commutativity of limits of vanishing thermal and rippling fluctuations.","Mechanical nonlinearities dominate the motion of nanoresonators already at relatively small oscillation amplitudes. Although single and coupled two-degrees-of-freedom models have been used to account for experimentally observed nonlinear effects, it is shown that these models quickly deviate from experimental findings when multiple modes influence the nonlinear response. Here, we present a nonlinear reduced-order modelling methodology based on FEM simulations for capturing the global nonlinear dynamics of nanomechanical resonators. Our physics-based approach obtains the quadratic and cubic nonlinearities of resonators over a wide frequency range that spans 70 MHz. To qualitatively validate our approach, we perform experiments on a graphene nanodrum driven opto-thermally and show that the model can replicate diverse ranges of nonlinear phenomena, including multi-stability, parametric resonance, and different internal resonances without considering any empirical nonlinear fitting parameters. By providing a direct link between microscopic geometry, material parameters, and nonlinear dynamic response, we clarify the physical significance of nonlinear parameters that are obtained from fitting the dynamics of nanomechanical systems, and provide a route for designing devices with desired nonlinear behaviour.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Metastable massive gravitons from an infinite extra dimension,The large-N running of the spectral index of inflation,True,"Motivated by stringy considerations, Randall & Sundrum have proposed a model where all the fields and particles of physics, save gravity, are confined on a 4-dimensional brane embedded in 5-dimensional anti-deSitter space. Their scenario features a stable bound state of bulk gravity waves and the brane that reproduces standard general relativity. We demonstrate that in addition to this zero-mode, there is also a discrete set of metastable bound states that behave like massive 4-dimensional gravitons which decay by tunneling into the bulk. These are resonances of the bulk-brane system akin to black hole quasinormal modes--as such, they give rise to the dominant corrections to 4-dimensional gravity. The phenomenology of braneworld perturbations is greatly simplified when these resonant modes are taken into account, which is illustrated by considering gravitational radiation emitted from nearby sources and early universe physics.","We extend previous classifications of inflationary models by means of their behaviour at large-N, where N is the number of e-foldings. In addition to the perturbative 1/N case, whose slow-roll parameters fall off as powers of 1/N, we introduce the constant, non-perturbative and logarithmic classes. This covers the large majority of inflationary models. Furthermore, we calculate the running of the spectral tilt for all these classes. Remarkably, we find that the tilt's runnings essentially cluster around the permil level.

icet - A Python library for constructing and sampling alloy cluster expansions,Crystal Structure Generation Based on Polyhedra using Dual Periodic Graphs,True,"Alloy cluster expansions (CEs) provide an accurate and computationally efficient mapping of the potential energy surface of multi-component systems that enables comprehensive sampling of the many-dimensional configuration space. Here, we introduce \textsc{icet}, a flexible, extensible, and computationally efficient software package for the construction and sampling of CEs. \textsc{icet} is largely written in Python for easy integration in comprehensive workflows, including first-principles calculations for the generation of reference data and machine learning libraries for training and validation. The package enables training using a variety of linear regression algorithms with and without regularization, Bayesian regression, feature selection, and cross-validation. It also provides complementary functionality for structure enumeration and mapping as well as data management and analysis. Potential applications are illustrated by two examples, including the computation of the phase diagram of a prototypical metallic alloy and the analysis of chemical ordering in an inorganic semiconductor.","Crystal structure design is important for the discovery of new highly functional materials because crystal structure strongly influences material properties. Crystal structures are composed of space-filling polyhedra, which affect material properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant. However, most conventional methods of crystal structure prediction use random structure generation methods that do not take space-filling polyhedra into account, contributing to the inefficiency of materials development. In this work, we propose a crystal structure generation method based on discrete geometric analysis of polyhedra information. In our method, the shape and connectivity of a space-filling polyhedron are represented as a dual periodic graph, and the crystal structure is generated by the standard realization of this graph. We demonstrate that this method can correctly generate face-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and body-centered cubic structures from dual periodic graphs. This work is a first step toward generating undiscovered crystal structures based on the target polyhedra, leading to major advances in materials design in areas including electronics and energy storage.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Superconductivity in Inhomogeneous Hubbard Models,Ground state fidelity from tensor network representations,True,"We present a controlled perturbative approach to the low temperature phase diagram of highly inhomogeneous Hubbard models in the limit of small coupling, $t'$, between clusters. We apply this to the dimerized and checkerboard models. The dimerized model is found to behave like a doped semiconductor, with a Fermi-liquid groundstate with parameters ({\it e.g.} the effective mass) which are smooth functions of the Hubbard interaction, $U$. By contrast, the checkerboard model has a nodeless d-wave superconducting state (preformed pair condensate, $d$-BEC) for $0 < U < U_c$, which smoothly crosses over to an intermediate BCS-like superconducting phase ($d$-BCS), also with no nodal quasi-particles, for $|U - U_c| < {\cal O}(t^\prime)$, which gives way to a Fermi liquid phase at large $U > U_c = 4.58$.","For any D-dimensional quantum lattice system, the fidelity between two ground state many-body wave functions is mapped onto the partition function of a D-dimensional classical statistical vertex lattice model with the same lattice geometry. The fidelity per lattice site, analogous to the free energy per site, is well-defined in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to characterize the phase diagram of the model. We explain how to compute the fidelity per site in the context of tensor network algorithms, and demonstrate the approach by analyzing the two-dimensional quantum Ising model with transverse and parallel magnetic fields.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Leggett modes and multi-band superconductivity in Sr2RuO4,On the possibility of the fractional ac Josephson effect in non-topological conventional superconductor-normal-superconductor junctions,True,"Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is a prototypical multi-band superconductor with three bands crossing the Fermi level. These bands exhibit distinct dimensional characteristics, with one quasi-2D $\gamma$-band and two quasi-1D $\alpha$- and $\beta$-bands. This leads to the expectation that the superconductivity on the $\gamma$-band may be only weakly Josephson-coupled to that on the other two bands. Based on an explicit microscopic weak coupling calculation appropriate for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, we study the collective Leggett modes associated with the relative phase oscillations between the bands and show that a relatively soft Leggett mode exists due to the comparatively weaker inter-band Josephson coupling. These calculations also provide insight into why the superconducting gap magnitudes may be comparable on all three bands, despite the noticeable differences between the $\gamma$ and $\alpha, \beta$ bands. The analyses can be readily applied to other multi-band superconductors.","Topological superconductors supporting Majorana Fermions with non-abelian statistics are presently a subject of intense theoretical and experimental effort. It has been proposed that the observation of a half-frequency or a fractional Josephson effect is a more reliable test for topological superconductivity than the search for end zero modes. Low-energy end modes can occur accidentally due to impurities. In fact, the fractional Josephson effect has been observed for the semiconductor nanowire system. Here we consider the ac Josephson effect in a conventional s-wave superconductor-normal metal-superconductor junction at a finite voltage. Using a Floquet-Keldysh treatment of the finite voltage junction, we show that the power dissipated from the junction, which measures the ac Josephson effect, can show a peak at half (or even incommensurate fractions) of the Josephson frequency. A similar conclusion is shown to hold for the Shapiro step measurement. The ac fractional Josephson peak can also be understood simply in terms of Landau-Zener processes associated with the Andreev bound state spectrum of the junction.",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

Galaxy-CMB and galaxy-galaxy lensing on large scales: sensitivity to primordial non-Gaussianity,C II radiative cooling of the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium: Insight about the star formation in Damped Lyman-alpha systems,True,"A convincing detection of primordial non-Gaussianity in the local form of the bispectrum, whose amplitude is given by the fNL parameter, offers a powerful test of inflation. In this paper we calculate the modification of two-point cross-correlation statistics of weak lensing - galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) cross-correlation - due to fNL. We derive and calculate the covariance matrix of galaxy-galaxy lensing including cosmic variance terms. We focus on large scales (l<100) for which the shape noise of the shear measurement becomes irrelevant and cosmic variance dominates the error budget. For a modest degree of non-Gaussianity, fNL=+/-50, modifications of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal at the 10% level are seen on scales R~300 Mpc, and grow rapidly toward larger scales as \propto R^2. We also see a clear signature of the baryonic acoustic oscillation feature in the matter power spectrum at ~150 Mpc, which can be measured by next-generation lensing experiments. In addition we can probe the local-form primordial non-Gaussianity in the galaxy-CMB lensing signal by correlating the lensing potential reconstructed from CMB with high-z galaxies. For example, for fNL=+/-50, we find that the galaxy-CMB lensing cross power spectrum is modified by ~10% at l~40, and by a factor of two at l~10, for a population of galaxies at z=2 with a bias of 2. The effect is greater for more highly biased populations at larger z; thus, high-z galaxy surveys cross-correlated with CMB offer a yet another probe of primordial non-Gaussianity.","The far-infrared [C II] 158 micrometer fine structure transition is considered to be a dominant coolant in the interstellar medium. For this reason, under the assumption of a thermal steady state, it may be used to infer the heating rate and, in turn, the star formation rate in local, as well as in high redshift systems. In this work, radio and ultraviolet observations of the Galactic interstellar medium are used to understand whether C II is indeed a good tracer of the star formation rate. For a sample of high Galactic latitude sightlines, direct measurements of the temperature indicate the presence of C II in both the cold and the warm phases of the diffuse interstellar gas. The cold gas fraction (~ 10 - 50% of the total neutral gas column density) is not negligible even at high Galactic latitude. It is shown that, to correctly estimate the star formation rate, C II cooling in both the phases should hence be considered. The simple assumption, that the [C II] line originates only from either the cold or the warm phase, significantly underpredicts or overpredicts the star formation rate, respectively. These results are particularly important in the context of the Damped Lyman-alpha systems for which a similar method is often used to estimate the star formation rate. The derived star formation rates in such cases may not be reliable if the temperature of the gas under consideration is not constrained independently.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

X-ray microtomography of heavy microstructures: the case of Plasma-Sprayed Tungsten and Tungsten-Steel MMC,"Magnetic anisotropy of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films studied by Fe and Pt $L_{2,3}$-edges x-ray magnetic circular dichroism",True,"In this paper synchrotron microtomography on Plasma Sprayed Tungsten (PS-W) is presented and discussed. PS-W is a challenging material for microtomography since it exhibits a random porous network at different length-scales (from nanometers to micrometers) and is hardly penetrable by X-rays. Furthermore, inner porosity causes strong internal scattering. The key challenges were, firstly, to optimize the beam parameters considering the inherent trade-off between photon energy (penetration depth) and spatial resolution and, secondly, to develop effective signal filtering algorithms. Despite the limited signal-to-noise ratio detected, large volumes of PS-W could be reconstructed with good image quality and micrometric resolution (voxel size = 1.4 {\mu}m). As an important result, we report excellent image quality and higher penetration depth by applying the same setup on a ferrous microstructure, namely a 10%W/Steel MMC used as interlayer between PS-W and a ferritic/martensitic steel substrate. The paper reports a detailed 3D morphological analysis of all inclusion types in PS-W and W/Steel, which led to disclosure of a complex connected porous network in both media. The analysis is presented in terms of multiphase volume fraction, ratio of percolation and 3D shape descriptors. 3D percolation patterns are analyzed in detail and sensitivity towards segmentation threshold for the noise-affected PS-W region is discussed. Remarkably, percolation of the porous phase was found throughout the entire coating thickness of PS-W. In W-Steel MMC percolation was found in the perpendicular plane and interpreted as onset of delamination caused by thermomechanical stress.","The strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of $L{\rm1_0}$-ordered FePt has been the subject of extensive studies for a long time. However, it is not known which element, Fe or Pt, mainly contributes to the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). We have investigated the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moments of Fe 3$d$ and Pt 5$d$ electrons in $L{\rm1_0}$-ordered FePt thin films by Fe and Pt $L_{2,3}$-edge x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements for samples with various degrees of long-range chemical order $S$. Fe $L_{2,3}$-edge XMCD showed that the orbital magnetic moment was larger when the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the film than parallel to it, and that the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment increased with $S$. Pt $L_{2,3}$-edge XMCD also showed that the orbital magnetic moment was smaller when the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the film than parallel to it, opposite to the Fe $L_{2,3}$-edge XMCD results although the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment increases with $S$ like the Fe edge. These results are qualitatively consistent with the first-principles calculation by Solovyev ${\it et\ al.}$ [Phys. Rev. B $\bf{52}$, 13419 (1995).], which also predicts the dominant contributions of Pt 5$d$ to the magnetic anisotropy energy rather than Fe 3$d$ due to the strong spin-orbit coupling and the small spin splitting of the Pt 5$d$ bands in $L{\rm1_0}$-ordered FePt.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Influence of the projectile description on breakup calculations,"Contributions of $2\pi$-exchange, $1\pi$-exchange, and contact three-body forces in NNLO ChEFT to $_\Lambda^3$H",True,"Calculations of the breakup of 8B and 11Be are performed with the aim of analyzing their sensitivity to the projectile description. Several potentials adjusted on the same experimental data are used for each projectile. The results vary significantly with the potential choice, and this sensitivity differs from one projectile to the other. In the 8B case, the breakup cross section is approximately scaled by the asymptotic normalization coefficient of the initial bound state (ANC). For $^{11}$Be, the overall normalization of the breakup cross section is no longer solely determined by the ANC. The partial waves describing the continuum are found to play a significant role in this variation, as the sensitivity of the phase shifts to the projectile description changes with the physical constraints imposed to the potential.","Faddeev calculations of hypertriton ($_\Lambda^3$H) separation energy are performed, incorporating all next-to-next-to-leading-order $\Lambda$NN three-body forces (3BFs) in chiral effective field theory: $2\pi$-exchange, $1\pi$-exchange, and contact interactions. The $1\pi$-exchange and contact interactions are rewritten in a form suitable for evaluating partial-wave matrix elements. The $\Lambda$-deuteron folding potentials constructed from these 3BFs are evaluated to demonstrate their contributions to \h3t. The $1\pi$-exchange interaction provides an attractive effect in which the d-state component of the deuteron wave function plays an important role. The attractive contribution tends to cancel the repulsive ones from the $2\pi$-exchange and contact 3BFs. Faddeev calculations show that the net effect of the 3BFs to the \h3t separation energy is small in a range between $-5$ to $+20$ keV, depending on the NN interaction used.

Prospecting for the superfluid transition in electron-hole coupled quantum wells using Coulomb drag,"Comment on ""Validity of Einstein Relation in Disordered Organic Semiconductors""",True,"I investigate the possibility of using Coulomb drag to detect a precursor of the predicted (but as yet not definitively observed) superfluid transition in electron-hole coupled quantum wells. The drag transresisitivity $\rho_{21}$ is shown to be significantly enhanced above the transition temperature $T_c$ and to diverge logarithmically as $T\to T_c^+$, due to electron-hole pairing fluctuations which are somewhat analogous to the Maki-Thompson contribution to conductivity in metals above the superconducting $T_c$. The enhancement in $\rho_{21}$ is estimated to be detectable at temperatures much higher than $T_c$.","Wetzelaer, Koster, and Blom [PRL 107, 066605] recently observed that the classic Einstein relation $\frac{D}{\mu}=\frac{kT}{q}$ is still valid in disordered semiconductors in thermal(quasi)equilibrium by studying the diffusion-driven currents of single-carrier diodes. This is in contrast to the previous theoretical prediction [2] and experiment observation from Leo et.al. [3] where the Einstein relation increases with 1/T. We will discuss the reason for this discrepancy here and suggest that one-carrier diodes experiment might nor be suitable for verifying Einstein relation in organic semiconductors.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Optimal Condition for Strong Terahertz Radiation from Intrinsic Josephson Junctions,Polaron Crystallization and Melting: Effects of the Long-Range Coulomb Forces,True,"In order to enhance the radiation power in terahertz band based on the intrinsic Josephson junctions of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ single crystal, we investigate a long cylindrical sample embedded in a dielectric material. Tuning the dielectric constant, the radiation power has a maximum which is achieved when it equals the dissipation caused by Josephson plasma. This yields the optimal dielectric constant of wrapping material in terms of the properties of BSCCO single crystal. The maximal radiation power is found proportional to the product of the typical superconducting current squared and the typical normal resistance, or the gap energy squared divided by the typical normal resistance, which offers a guideline for choosing superconductor as a source of strong radiation. By introducing an anti-reflection layer, we can build a compact device with the BSCCO cylinder and two wrapping dielectric layers with finite thicknesses.","On examining the stability of a Wigner crystal in an ionic dielectric, two competitive effects due to the polaron formation are found to be important: (i) the screening of the Coulomb force, which destabilizes the crystal, compensated by (ii) the increase of the carrier mass (polaron mass). The competition between the two effects is carefully studied, and the quantum melting of the polaronic Wigner crystal is examined by varying the density at zero temperature. By calculating the quantum fluctuations of both the electron and the polarization, we show that there is a competition between the dissociation of the polarons at the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT), and a melting towards a polaron liquid. We find that at strong coupling, a liquid state of dielectric polarons cannot exist, and the IMT is driven by the polaron dissociation. Next, taking into account the dipolar interactions between localized carriers, we show that these are responsible for an instability of the transverse vibrational modes of the polaronic Wigner crystal as the density increases. This provides a new mechanism for the IMT in doped dielectrics, which yields interesting dielectric properties below and beyond the transition. An optical signature of such a mechanism for the IMT is provided.",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

Time-dependent analysis of $B^0 \to {{K^0_{S}}} \pi^- \pi^+ \gamma$ decays and studies of the $K^+\pi^-\pi^+$ system in $B^+ \to K^+ \pi^- \pi^+ \gamma$ decays,Extraction of neutron density distributions from high-statistics coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering data,True,"We measure the time-dependent $CP$ asymmetry in the radiative-penguin decay $B^0 \to {{K^0_{S}}} \pi^- \pi^+ \gamma$, using a sample of $471$ million $\Upsilon(4S) \to B{\kern 0.18em\overline{\kern -0.18em B}}$ events recorded with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$ storage ring at SLAC. Using events with $m_{K\pi\pi}<1.8{\mathrm{\,Ge\kern -0.1em V/}c^2}$, we measure the branching fractions of $B^+ \to K^+ \pi^- \pi^+ \gamma$ and $B^0 \to K^0 \pi^+ \pi^- \gamma$, the branching fractions of the kaonic resonances decaying to $K^+ \pi^- \pi^+$, as well as the overall branching fractions of the $B^+ \to \rho^0 K^+ \gamma$, $B^+ \to K^{*0} \pi^+ \gamma$ and S-wave $B^+ \to (K \pi)^{*0}_0 \pi^+ \gamma$ components. For events from the $\rho$ mass band, we measure the $CP$-violating parameters ${\mathcal{S}_{{{K^0_{S}}}\pi^+\pi^-\gamma}} = 0.14 \pm 0.25 \pm 0.03$ and ${\mathcal{C}_{{{K^0_{S}}}\pi^+\pi^-\gamma}} = -0.39 \pm 0.20^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. We extract from this measurement the time-dependent $CP$ asymmetry related to the $CP$ eigenstate $\rho^0 {{K^0_{S}}}$ and obtain ${\mathcal{S}_{{{K^0_{S}}}\rho\gamma}} = -0.18 \pm 0.32^{+ 0.06}_{-0.05}$, which provides information on the photon polarization in the underlying $b \to s \gamma$ transition.","Forthcoming fixed-target coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments aim at measurements with $\cal{O}(\text{tonne})$-scale detectors and substantially reduced systematic and statistical uncertainties. With such high quality data, the extraction of point-neutron distributions mean-square radii requires a better understanding of possible theoretical uncertainties. We quantify the impact of single-nucleon electromagnetic mean-square radii on the weak-charge form factor and compare results from weak-charge form factor parametrizations and weak-charge form factor decompositions in terms of elastic vector proton and neutron form factors, including nucleon form factors $Q$-dependent terms up to order $Q^2$. We assess as well the differences arising from results derived using weak-charge form factor decompositions in terms of elastic vector proton and neutron form factors and a model-independent approach based solely on the assumption of spherically symmetric nuclear ground state. We demonstrate the impact of the main effects by assuming pseudo-data from a one-tonne LAr detector and find that, among the effects and under the assumptions considered in this paper, weak-charge form factor parametrizations and weak-charge form factor decompositions in terms of elastic vector proton and neutron form factors enable the extraction of the $^{40}\text{Ar}$ point-neutron distribution mean-square radius with a $\sim 15\%$ accuracy.

Time-Stretched $(U-B)_0$-$(M_B-2.5\log f_{\rm s})$ and $(V-I)_0$-$(M_I-2.5\log f_{\rm s})$ Color-Magnitude Diagrams of Novae in Outburst,Solar transition region above sunspots,True,"Light curves and color evolutions of two classical novae can be largely overlapped if we properly squeeze or stretch the timescale of a target nova against that of a template nova by $t'=t/f_{\rm s}$. Then the brightness of the target nova is related to the brightness of the template nova by $(M[t])_{\rm template} = (M[t/f_{\rm s}] - 2.5 \log f_{\rm s})_{\rm target}$, where $M[t]$ is the absolute magnitude and a function of time $t$, and $f_{\rm s}$ is the ratio of timescales between the target and template novae. In the previous papers of this series, we show that many novae broadly overlap in the time-stretched $(B-V)_0$-$(M_V-2.5 \log f_{\rm s})$ color-magnitude diagram. In the present paper, we propose two other $(U-B)_0$-$(M_B-2.5\log f_{\rm s})$ and $(V-I)_0$-$(M_I-2.5\log f_{\rm s})$ diagrams, and show that their tracks overlap for 16 novae and for 52 novae, respectively. Here, $(U-B)_0$, $(B-V)_0$, and $(V-I)_0$ are the intrinsic $U-B$, $B-V$, and $V-I$ colors and not changed by the time-stretch, and $M_B$, $M_V$, and $M_I$ are the absolute $B$, $V$, and $I$ magnitudes. Using these properties, we considerably refine the previous estimates of their distance and reddening. The obtained distances are in reasonable agreement with those of {\it Gaia} Data Release 2 catalogue.","We study the TR properties above sunspots and the surrounding plage regions, by analyzing several sunspot spectra obtained by SUMER in March 1999 and November 2006. We compare the SUMER spectra observed in the umbra, penumbra, plage, and sunspot plume regions. The Lyman line profiles averaged in each region are presented. For the sunspot observed in 2006, the electron densities, DEM, and filling factors of the TR plasma in the four regions are also investigated. The self-reversals of the Lyman line profiles are almost absent in umbral regions at different locations (heliocentric angle up to $49^\circ$) on the solar disk. In the sunspot plume, the Lyman lines are also not reversed, whilst the lower Lyman line profiles observed in the plage region are obviously reversed. The TR densities of the umbra and plume are similar and one order of magnitude lower than those of the plage and penumbra. The DEM curve of the sunspot plume exhibits a peak centered around $\log(T/\rm{K})\sim5.45$, which exceeds the DEM of other regions by one to two orders of magnitude at these temperatures. We also find that more than 100 lines, which are very weak or not observed anywhere else on the Sun, are well observed by SUMER in the sunspot, especially in the sunspot plume. We suggest that the TR above sunspots is higher and probably more extended, and that the opacity of the hydrogen lines is much smaller above sunspots, as compared to the TR above plage regions. Our result indicates that the enhanced TR emission of the sunspot plume is very likely to be the result of a large filling factor.

Superconductivity in monolayer and few-layer graphene: I. Review of possible pairing symmetries and basic electronic properties,Vortex interaction in thin films -- a crossover from type I to type II superconductivity,True,"We review all symmetry-allowed spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconducting (SC) order parameters in graphene ($s$-wave, $d$-wave, $p$-wave, and $f$-wave) generated by generic onsite, nearest-neighbor (NN), and next-to-nearest-neighbor (NNN) pairing interactions in a tight-binding model. For each pairing channel, we calculate both the band structure and the dependence of the density of states on energy, chemical potential, and on the pairing strength. In particular, we distinguish between nodal superconducting states and fully gapped states and study the dependence of gap closing points on the chemical potential and the superconducting pairing strength. We further investigate the difference between mono-, bi-, and tri-layer ABC and ABA graphene, including accounting for the effects of trigonal warping.","Interactions between vortices in thin superconducting films are investigated in the crossover (intertype) regime between superconductivity types I and II. We consider two main factors responsible for this crossover: a) changes in the material characteristics of the film and b) variations of the film thickness controlling the effect of the stray magnetic fields outside superconducting sample. The analysis is done within the formalism that combines the perturbation expansion of the microscopic equations to one order beyond the Ginzburg-Landau theory with the leading contribution of the stray fields. It is shown that the latter gives rise to qualitatively different spatial profile and temperature dependence of the vortex interaction potential, as compared to bulk vortex interactions. The resulting interaction is long-range repulsive while exhibiting complex competition of attraction and repulsion at small and intermediate separations of vortices. This explains the appearance of vortex chains reported earlier for superconducting films.",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

Central frequency of few-cycle laser pulses in strong-field processes,Effective renormalized multi-body interactions of harmonically confined ultracold neutral bosons,True,"We analyze the role of the difference between the central frequencies of the spectral distributions of the vector potential and the electric field of a short laser pulse. The frequency shift arises when the electric field is determined as the derivative of the vector potential to ensure that both quantities vanish at the beginning and end of the pulse. We derive an analytical estimate of the frequency shift and show how it affects various light induced processes, such as excitation, ionization and high harmonic generation. Since observables depend on the frequency spectrum of the electric field, the shift should be taken into account when setting the central frequency of the vector potential to avoid potential misinterpretation of numerical results for processes induced by few-cycle pulses.","We calculate the renormalized effective 2-, 3-, and 4-body interactions for N neutral ultracold bosons in the ground state of an isotropic harmonic trap, assuming 2-body interactions modeled with the combination of a zero-range and energy-dependent pseudopotential. We work to third-order in the scattering length a defined at zero collision energy, which is necessary to obtain both the leading-order effective 4-body interaction and consistently include finite-range corrections for realistic 2-body interactions. The leading-order, effective 3- and 4-body interaction energies are U3 = -(0.85576...)(a/l)^2 + 2.7921(1)(a/l)^3 + O[(a/l)^4] and U4 = +(2.43317...)(a/l)^3 + O[(a\l)^4], where w and l are the harmonic oscillator frequency and length, respectively, and energies are in units of hbar*w. The one-standard deviation error 0.0001 for the third-order coefficient in U3 is due to numerical uncertainty in estimating a slowly converging sum; the other two coefficients are either analytically or numerically exact. The effective 3- and 4-body interactions can play an important role in the dynamics of tightly confined and strongly correlated systems. We also performed numerical simulations for a finite-range boson-boson potential, and it was comparison to the zero-range predictions which revealed that finite-range effects must be taken into account for a realistic third-order treatment. In particular, we show that the energy-dependent pseudopotential accurately captures, through third order, the finite-range physics, and in combination with the multi-body effective interactions gives excellent agreement with the numerical simulations, validating our theoretical analysis and predictions.",Atomic Physics,"Atomic physics focuses on atomic and molecular structure, spectra, collisions, and data.

All-Optical Formation of Quantum Degenerate Mixtures,Detecting the tunneling rates for strongly interacting fermions on optical lattices,True,"We report the realization of quantum degenerate mixed gases of ytterbium (Yb) isotopes using all-optical methods. We have succeeded in cooling attractively interacting 176Yb atoms via sympathetic cooling down to below the Bose-Einstein transition temperature, coexisting with a stable condensate of 174Yb atoms with a repulsive interaction. We have observed a rapid atom loss in 176Yb atoms after cooling down below the transition temperature, which indicates the collapse of a 176Yb condensate. The sympathetic cooling technique has been applied to cool a 173Yb-174Yb Fermi-Bose mixture to the quantum degenerate regime.","Strongly interacting fermionic atoms on optical lattices are studied through a Hubbard-like model Hamiltonian, in which tunneling rates of atoms and molecules between neighboring sites are assumed to be different. In the limit of large onsite repulsion U, the model is shown to reproduce the t-J Hamiltonian, in which the J coefficient of the Heisenberg term depends on the particle-assisted tunneling rate g: explicitly, $J=4 g^2/U$. At half-filling, g drives a crossover from a Brinkman-Rice paramagnetic insulator of fully localized atoms (g=0) to the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator of the standard Hubbard case (g=t). This is observed already at the intermediate coupling regime in the number of doubly occupied sites, thus providing a criterion to extract from measurements the effective value of g.",Other Condensed Matter,Other condensed matter in physics focuses on topics that fall outside the scope of more specific categories.
Nanoscale probing of image-potential states and electron transfer doping in borophene polymorphs,Switching the magnetic configuration of a spin valve by current induced domain wall motion,True,"Using field-emission resonance spectroscopy with an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope, we reveal Stark-shifted image-potential states of the v_1/6 and v_1/5 borophene polymorphs on Ag(111) with long lifetimes, suggesting high borophene lattice and interface quality. These image-potential states allow the local work function and interfacial charge transfer of borophene to be probed at the nanoscale and test the widely employed self-doping model of borophene. Supported by apparent barrier height measurements and density functional theory calculations, electron transfer doping occurs for both borophene phases from the Ag(111) substrate. In contradiction with the self-doping model, a higher electron transfer doping level occurs for denser v_1/6 borophene compared to v_1/5 borophene, thus revealing the importance of substrate effects on borophene electron transfer.","We present experimental results on the displacement of a domain wall by injection of a dc current through the wall. The samples are 1 micron wide long stripes of a CoO/Co/Cu/NiFe classical spin valve structure. The stripes have been patterned by electron beam lithography. A neck has been defined at 1/3 of the total length of the stripe and is a pinning center for the domain walls, as shown by the steps of the giant magnetoresistance curves at intermediate levels (1/3 or 2/3) between the resistances corresponding to the parallel and antiparallel configurations. We show by electric transport measurements that, once a wall is trapped, it can be moved by injecting a dc current higher than a threshold current of the order of magnitude of 10^7 A/cm^2.

AGN Jet Kinetic Power and the Energy Budget of Radio Galaxy Lobes,On the Evolution of the Cosmic Ionizing Background,True,"Recent results based on the analysis of radio galaxies and their hot X-ray emitting atmospheres suggest that non-radiating particles dominate the energy budget in the lobes of FRI radio galaxies, in some cases by a factor of more than 1000, while radiating particles dominate the energy budget in FRII radio galaxy lobes. This implies a significant difference in the radiative efficiency of the two morphological classes. To test this hypothesis, we have measured the kinetic energy flux for a sample of 3C FRII radio sources using a new method based on the observed parameters of the jet terminal hotspots, and compared the resulting Q(jet) - L(radio) relation to that obtained for FRI radio galaxies based on X-ray cavity measurements. Contrary to expectations, we find approximate agreement between the Q(jet) - L(radio) relations determined separately for FRI and FRII radio galaxies. This result is ostensibly difficult to reconcile with the emerging scenario in which the lobes of FRI and FRII radio galaxies have vastly different energy budgets. However, a combination of lower density environment, spectral ageing and strong shocks driven by powerful FRII radio galaxies may reduce the radiative efficiency of these objects relative to FRIs and couteract, to some extent, the higher radiative efficiency expected to arise due to the lower fraction of energy in non-radiating particles. An unexpected corollary is that extrapolating the Q(jet) - L(radio) relation determined for low power FRI radio galaxies provides a reasonable approximation for high power sources, despite their apparently different lobe compositions.","We study the observed cosmic ionizing background as a constraint on the nature of the sources responsible for the reionization of the Universe. In earlier work, we showed that extrapolations of the Ultra-Violet Luminosity Function (LF) of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at fixed Lyman continuum photon escape fraction are not able to reproduce the redshift evolution of this background. Here, we employ extrapolations of the high-z LFs to describe the contribution of LBGs to the ionizing photon rate, taking into account the smoothing of the baryonic perturbations, due to the background itself (i.e. the filtering mass), as well as a possible sharp increase of the escape fraction in dwarf galaxies. Under the hypothesis of a dominant contribution of LBGs to cosmic reionization, our results suggest that sources fainter than the current observational limits should be characterised by escape fractions of the order of ~0.1-0.3 (larger than the current estimates for bright galaxies) to account for a z>6 reionization and the measured evolution of cosmic ionizing background, at the same time. The contribution to the background from quasars turns out to be relevant at z<3. Overall, our results support the case for dedicated observations of faint galaxies in the rest-frame UV, in order to better determine their physical properties.

Theoretical Remarks on Cybotactic Clusters of Bent-Core Nematic Liquid Crystals in 1D Settings,Two-temperature activity induces liquid-crystal phases inaccessible in equilibrium,True,"The bent-core liquid crystals (LCs) are highly regarded as the next-generation materials for electro-optic devices. The nematic (N) phase of these LCs possesses highly ordered smectic-like cybotactic clusters which are promising in terms of ferroelectric-like behaviour in the N phase itself. We have studied a one-dimensional (1D) Landau-deGennes model of spatially inhomogeneous order parameters for the N phase of bent-core LCs. We investigate the effects of spatial confinement and coupling (between these clusters and the surrounding LC molecules) on the order parameters to model cluster formation in recently reported experiments. The coupling is found to increase the cluster order parameter significantly, suggesting an enhancement in the cluster formation and could also predict a possible transition to a phase with weak nematic-like ordering in the vicinity of nematic-isotropic transition upon appreciable increase of the coupling parameter {\gamma}.","In equilibrium hard-rod fluids, and in effective hard-rod descriptions of anisotropic soft-particle systems, the transition from the isotropic (I) phase to the nematic phase (N) is observed above the rod aspect ratio L/D = 3.70 as predicted by Onsager. We examine the fate of this criterion in a molecular dynamics study of a system of soft repulsive spherocylinders rendered active by coupling half the particles to a heat bath at a higher temperature than that imposed on the other half. We show that the system phase separates and self-organizes into various liquid-crystalline phases that are not observed in equilibrium for the respective aspect ratios.

Enhancement of spin relaxation time in hydrogenated graphene spin valve devices,Superfluidity of 4He nanoclusters in confinement,True,"Hydrogen adsorbates in graphene are interesting as they are not only strong Coulomb scatterers but they also induce a change in orbital hybridization of the carbon network from sp^2 into sp^3. This change increases the spin-orbit coupling and is expected to largely modify spin relaxation. In this work we report the change in spin transport properties of graphene due to plasma hydrogenation. We observe an up to three-fold increase of spin relaxation time tau_S after moderate hydrogen exposure. This increase of tau_S is accompanied by the decrease of charge and spin diffusion coefficients, resulting in a minor change in spin relaxation length lambda_S. At high carrier density we obtain lambda_S of 7 microns, which allows for spin detection over a distance of 11 microns. After hydrogenation a value of tau_S as high as 2.7 ns is measured at room temperature.","Structure and superfluid response of nanoscale size helium-four clusters enclosed in spherical cavities are studied by computer simulations. The curved surface causes the formation of well-defined concentric shells, thus imparting to the system a very different structure from that of free standing clusters. On a strongly attractive substrate, superfluidity is only observed at low density, in the single layer coating the inner surface of the cavity.

Each fermion is assumed to decay directly into a Standard Model quark and an invisible stable particle. T-odd quarks (T-quarks) and the lightest T-odd particle (LTP) of the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity provide an example of this setup. We estimate the bounds based on the published CMS search for events with jets and missing transverse energy in the 35 pb-1 data set collected in the 2010 run. We find that T-quark masses below about 450 GeV are ruled out for the LTP mass about 100 GeV. This bound is somewhat stronger than the published Tevatron constraint. We also estimate the reach with higher integrated luminosities expected in the 2011-12 run. If no deviation from the SM is observed, we expect that a bound on the T-quark mass of about 650 GeV, for the LTP mass of 300 GeV and below, can be achieved with 1 fb-1 of data.

Every ensemble attains its wholeness and becomes a physical body through togetherness of interrelated components coexisting as a collective being with mutually restrained internal motion. Properties of ensembles on all structural levels of matter composition emerge through the collective being of components.","In the present work we propose an algorithm based on the theory of prime numbers for the estimation of the magnetic field in a device of current carrying circular rings. Using the proposed algorithm, the magnetic field can be determined in a very good agreement with that resulting from an algorithm based on the Biot-Savart law. In addition, the prime-numbers-based algorithm gives quantized values of the magnetic field and reveals previously unknown behaviors such as special properties of the distribution of the waiting times at the quantized magnetic field values. Applications of the proposed prime-numbers-based algorithm to systems exhibiting symbolic dynamics is presented, proving its ability to provide a measure of the existence or not of dynamics in the system.",General Physics,"General physics focuses on multidisciplinary topics, speculative ideas, and proposals that cover more than one area of physics.

Using two point correlation functions to understand the assembly histories of Milky Way-like galaxies,Giant radio galaxies in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey-I,True,"The two point correlation function (2PCF) is a powerful statistical tool to measure galaxy clustering. Although 2PCF has also been used to study the clustering of stars on parsec and sub-parsec scales, its physical implication is not clear on such non-linear scales. In this study, we use the Illustris-TNG50 simulation to study the connection between the 2PCF signals of accreted halo stars and the assembly histories of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find, in general, the 2PCF signal increases with the increase in galactocentric radii, $r$, and with the decrease in the pair separations. Galaxies which assemble late on average have stronger 2PCF signals. With $z_{1/4}$, $z_{1/2}$ and $z_{3/4}$ defined as the redshifts when galaxies accreted one-fourth, half and three-fourths of their ex-situ stellar mass at today, we find all of them show the strongest correlations with the 2PCF signals at $r\sim0.2R_{200}$. $z_{3/4}$ shows the strongest correlations at all radii than those of $z_{1/4}$ or $z_{1/2}$, as later accreted stars preserve better clusterings. However, the correlations between the 2PCF signals at different radii and the galaxy formation times all have large scatters. The 2PCFs in velocity space show weaker correlations with the galaxy formation times within $0.38R_{200}$ than real space 2PCFs, and the scatter is considerably large. Both the real and velocity space 2PCFs correlate with the assembly histories of the host dark matter halos as well. Within $0.38R_{200}$, the real space 2PCF shows stronger correlations with the galaxy formation histories than with the halo formation histories, while the velocity space 2PCFs do not show large differences. We conclude that it is difficult to use 2PCF alone to precisely predict the formation times or assembly histories of galaxies.","Giant radio galaxies (GRGs) are a subclass of radio galaxies which have grown to megaparsec scales. GRGs are much rarer than normal sized radio galaxies (< 0.7 Mpc) and the reason for their gigantic sizes is still debated. Here, we report the biggest sample of GRGs identified to date. These objects were found in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) first data release images, which cover a 424 square degrees region. Of the 239 GRGs found, 225 are new discoveries. The GRGs in our sample have sizes ranging from 0.7 to 3.5 Mpc and have redshifts (z) between 0.1 and 2.3. Seven GRGs have sizes above 2 Mpc and one has a size of ~ 3.5 Mpc. The sample contains 40 GRGs hosted by spectroscopically confirmed quasars. Here, we present the search techniques employed and the resulting catalogue of the newly discovered large sample of GRGs along with their radio properties. We, here also show for the first time that the spectral index of GRGs is similar to that of normal sized radio galaxies, indicating that most of the GRG population is not dead or is not like remnant type radio galaxy.

Persistent circular currents of exciton-polaritons in cylindrical pillar microcavities,"Bistability between $\pi$-diradical open-shell and closed-shell states in indeno[1,2-a]fluorene",True,"We have experimentally observed an eddy current of exciton polaritons arising in a cylindrical GaAs/AlGaAs pillar microcavity under the nonresonant optical pumping. The polariton current manifests itself in a Mach-Zehnder interferometry image as a characteristic spiral that occurs due to the interference of the light emitted by an exciton-polariton condensate with a spherical wave artificially shaped from the emission of the same condensate. We have experimentally observed the condensates with the topological charges m = +1, m = -1 and m = -2. The interference pattern corresponding to the m = -2 current represents the twin spiral emerging from the center of the micropillar.","Indenofluorenes are non-benzenoid conjugated hydrocarbons that have received great interest owing to their unusual electronic structure and potential applications in non-linear optics and photovoltaics. Here, we report the generation of unsubstituted indeno[1,2-a]fluorene, the final and yet unreported parent indenofluorene isomer, on various surfaces by cleavage of two C-H bonds in 7,12-dihydroindeno[1,2-a]fluorene through voltage pulses applied by the tip of a combined scanning tunneling microscope and atomic force microscope. On bilayer NaCl on Au(111), indeno[1,2-a]fluorene is in the neutral charge state, while it exhibits charge bistability between neutral and anionic states on the lower work function surfaces of bilayer NaCl on Ag(111) and Cu(111). In the neutral state, indeno[1,2-a]fluorene exhibits either of two ground states: an open-shell pi-diradical state, predicted to be a triplet by density functional and multireference many-body perturbation theory calculations, or a closed-shell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety in the as-indacene core.

Full potential LAPW calculation of electron momentum density and related properties of Li,Effective model and pairing tendency in bilayer Ni-based superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$,True,"Electron momentum density and Compton profiles in Lithium along $<100 >$, $<110>$, and $<111>$ directions are calculated using Full-Potential Linear Augmented Plane Wave basis within generalized gradient approximation. The profiles have been corrected for correlations with Lam-Platzman formulation using self-consistent charge density. The first and second derivatives of Compton profiles are studied to investigate the Fermi surface breaks. Decent agreement is observed between recent experimental and our calculated values. Our values for the derivatives are found to be in better agreement with experiments than earlier theoretical results. Two-photon momentum density and one- and two-dimensional angular correlation of positron annihilation radiation are also calculated within the same formalism and including the electron-positron enhancement factor.","Since the discovery of cuprate, the origin of high-T$_c$ superconductivity has been an outstanding puzzle. Recently, high-T$_c$ superconductivity was observed in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, whose structure hosts the apical oxygen between two layers, distinct from multi-layer cuprates. Motivated by this discovery, we investigate its electronic structure using first-principle calculations and superconducting instabilities from both weak-coupling and strong-coupling perspective. Based on the first-principle band structures, we construct a bilayer two-orbital model on a square lattice, consisting of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, which accurately captures the low-energy electronic properties. Within this model, we study pairing instability using both functional renormalization group approach and multi-orbital t-J model. An $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing with sign-reversal gaps on different Fermi surfaces is revealed, reminiscent of iron based superconductors. The Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital and its associated interlayer and intralayer exchange couplings are found to be crucial for the high-T$_c$ superconductivity.

"ADJOINT ""QUARK"" COLOR FIELDS IN FOUR-DIMENSIONAL LATTICE GAUGE THEORY: VACUUM SCREENING AND PENETRATION",QED on a momentum lattice,True,"The fields generated by ``quarks'' in the adjoint representation of SU(2) color are analyzed in the scaling region of the four-dimensional lattice theory. Evidence of vacuum screening of adjoint quarks is obtained from a comparison of quark-antiquark ($Q \bar Q$) flux-tubes for quarks in the adjoint (``isospin'' $j=1$) and fundamental ($j=1/2$) representations. The component ${\cal E}_j$ of the color-electric field strength in the direction parallel to the $Q \bar Q$ axis is calculated. Near the quarks the ratio of fields ${\cal E}_{j=1} / {\cal E}_{j=1/2}$ approaches the value 8/3, which is equal to the ratio of SU(2) Casimirs. In between the quarks, the ratio falls well below 8/3 at large $R$. ${\cal E}_j$ also falls off rapidly as a function of distance $x_\perp$ perpendicular to the $Q \bar Q$ axis. However, the ratio ${\cal E}_{j=1} / {\cal E}_{j=1/2}$ depends very weakly on $x_\perp$. The flux-tubes in the two representations thus appear to have very similar cross-sections. This result could imply that the QCD vacuum is dual to a type I superconductor.",We investigate the possibility of doing momentum space lattice simulations as an alternative to the conventional method.

Open M2-branes with Flux and Modified Basu-Harvey Equation,Symmetry-breaking effects of instantons in parton gauge theories,True,"The supersymmetric actions of closed multiple M2 branes with flux for the BL and the ABJM theories have been constructed recently by Lambert and Richmond in \cite{LR}. In this paper we extend the construction to the case of open M2-branes with flux and derive the boundary conditions. This allows us to derive the modified Basu-Harvey equation in the presence of flux. As an example, we consider the Lorentzian BL model. A new feature of the fuzzy funnel solution describing a D2-D4 intersection is obtained as a result of the flux.","Compact quantum electrodynamics (CQED$_3$) with Dirac fermionic matter provides an adequate framework for elucidating the universal low-energy physics of a wide variety of (2+1)D strongly correlated systems. Fractionalized states of matter correspond to its deconfined phases, where the gauge field is effectively noncompact, while conventional broken-symmetry phases are associated with confinement triggered by the proliferation of monopole-instantons. While much attention has been devoted lately to the symmetry classification of monopole operators in massless CQED$_3$ and related 3D conformal field theories, explicit derivations of instanton dynamics in parton gauge theories with fermions have been lacking. In this work, we use semiclassical methods analogous to those used by 't Hooft in the solution of the $U(1)$ problem in 4D quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to explicitly demonstrate the symmetry-breaking effect of instantons in CQED$_3$ with massive fermions, motivated by a fermionic parton description of hard-core bosons on a lattice. By contrast with the massless case studied by Marston, we find that massive fermions possess Euclidean zero modes exponentially localized to the center of the instanton. Such Euclidean zero modes produce in turn an effective four-fermion interaction -- known as the 't Hooft vertex in QCD -- which naturally leads to two possible superfluid phases for the original microscopic bosons: a conventional single-particle condensate or an exotic boson pair condensate without single-particle condensation.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Correlations of Baryon and Charge Stopping in Heavy Ion Collisions,QCD inequalities for hadron interactions,True,"Baryon numbers are carried by valence quarks in the standard QCD picture of the baryon structure, while some theory proposed an alternative baryon number carrier, a non-perturbative Y-shaped configuration of the gluon field, called the baryon junction in the 1970s. However, neither of the theories has been verified experimentally. It was recently suggested to search for the baryon junction by investigating the correlation of net-charge and net-baryon yields at midrapidity in heavy-ion collisions. This paper presents studies of such correlations in collisions of various heavy ions from Oxygen to Uranium with the UrQMD Monte Carlo model. The UrQMD model implements valence quark transport as the primary means of charge and baryon stopping at midrapidity. Detailed study are also carried out for isobaric $_{40}^{96}\mathrm{Zr}$ + $_{40}^{96}\mathrm{Zr}$ and $_{44}^{96}\mathrm{Ru}$ + $_{44}^{96}\mathrm{Ru}$ collisions. We found a universal trend of the charge stopping with respect to the baryon stopping, and that the charge stopping is always more than the baryon stopping. This study provides a model baseline in valence quark transport for what is expected in net-charge and net-baryon yields at midrapidity of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.","We derive generalisations of the Weingarten--Witten QCD mass inequalities for particular multi-hadron systems. For systems of any number of identical pseudo-scalar mesons of maximal isospin, these inequalities prove that interactions between the constituent mesons must be repulsive and that no bound states can form in these channels. Similar constraints in less symmetric systems are also extracted. These results are compatible with experimental results (where known) and recent lattice QCD calculations, and also lead to a more stringent bound on the nucleon mass than previously derived, $m_N \ge 3/2 m_\pi$.",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

The exceptional meson transitions are directly connected to semileptonic and CP-eigenstate decay channels. The possibility of extending the observable asymmetries to more decay channels confronts the problem of the ""orthogonality condition"", which can be stated with this tongue-twister: Given a decay channel $f$, Which is the decay channel $f'$ such that the meson state not decaying to $f'$ is orthogonal to the meson state not decaying to $f$? In this paper we propose an alternative $T$-Violation Asymmetry at meson factories which allows its opening to any pair of decay channels. Instead of searching which is the pair of decay channels associated to the $T$-reverse meson transition, we build an asymmetry which tags the initial states of both the Reference and the $T$-reverse meson transitions. This observable filters the appropriate final states by means of two measurable survival probabilities. We discuss the methodology to be followed in the analysis of the new observable and the results expected in specific examples.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Extracting the rho-omega mixing amplitude from the pion form-factor,Magic radioactivity of 252Cf,True,"We re-examine and extend a recent analysis which showed that the rho-omega mixing amplitude cannot be unambiguously extracted from the pion electromagnetic form-factor in a model independent way. In particular, we focus on the argument that the extraction is sensitive to the presence of any intrinsic omega_I -> 2pi coupling. Our extended analysis confirms the original conclusion, with only minor, quantitative differences. The extracted mixing amplitude is shown to be sensitive to both the intrinsic coupling omega_I -> 2pi and to the value assumed for the mass of the neutral rho meson.","We show that the sharp maximum corresponding to 107Mo in the fragment distribution of the 252Cf cold fission is actually a Sn-like radioactivity, similar to other decay processes in which magic nuclei are involved, namely alpha-decay and heavy cluster emission, also called Pb-like radioactivity. It turns out that the mass asymmetry degree of freedom has a key role in connecting initial Sn with the final Mo isotopes along the fission path. We suppose the cold rearrangement of nucleons within the framework of the two center shell model, in order to compute the cold valleys in the charge equilibrated fragmentation potential. The fission yields are estimated by using the semiclassical penetration approach. We consider five degrees of freedom, namely the inter-fragment distance, the shapes of fragments, the neck parameter and mass asymmetry. We found an isomeric minimum between the internal and external barriers. It turns out that the inner cold valley of the total potential energy is connected to the double magic isotope 132Sn",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

Localization properties of Chern insulators,Thermal drag in electronic conductors,True,"We study the localization properties of the equal-time electron Green's function in a Chern insulator in an arbitrary dimension and with an arbitrary number of bands. We prove that the Green's function cannot decay super-exponentially if the Hamiltonian is finite-range and the quantum Hall response is nonzero. For a general band Hamiltonian (possibly infinite-range), we prove that the Green's function cannot be finite-range if the quantum Hall response is nonzero. The proofs use methods of algebraic geometry.","We study the electronic thermal drag in two different Coulomb-coupled systems, the first one composed of two Coulomb blockaded metallic islands and the second one consisting of two parallel quantum wires. The two conductors of each system are electrically isolated and placed in the two circuits (the drive and the drag) of a four-electrode setup. The systems are biased, either by a temperature $\Delta T$ or a voltage $V$ difference, on the drive circuit, while no biases are present on the drag circuit. In the case of a pair of metallic islands we use a master equation approach to determine the general properties of the dragged heat current $I^{\rm (h)}_{\rm drag}$, accounting also for co-tunneling contributions and the presence of large biases. Analytic results are obtained in the sequential tunneling regime for small biases, finding, in particular, that $I^{\rm (h)}_{\rm drag}$ is quadratic in $\Delta T$ or $V$ and non-monotonous as a function of the inter-island coupling. Finally, by replacing one of the electrodes in the drag circuit with a superconductor, we find that heat can be extracted from the other normal electrode. In the case of the two interacting quantum wires, using the Luttinger liquid theory and the bosonization technique, we derive an analytic expression for the thermal trans-resistivity $\rho^{\rm (h)}_{12}$, in the weak-coupling limit and at low temperatures. $\rho^{\rm (h)}_{12}$ turns out to be proportional to the electric trans-resistivity $\rho^{\rm (c)}_{12}$, in such a way that their ratio (a kind of Wiedemann-Franz law) is proportional to $T^3$. We find that the thermal trans-resistivity is proportional to $T$ for low temperatures and decreases like $1/T$ for intermediate temperatures or like $1/T^3$ for high temperatures.

F-theoretic vs microscopic description of a conformal N=2 SYM theory,Understanding Our Universe: Current Status and Open Issues,True,"The F-theory background of four D7 branes in a type I' orientifold was conjectured to be described by the Seiberg-Witten curve for the superconformal SU(2) gauge theory with four flavors. This relation was explained by considering in this background a probe D3 brane, which supports this theory with SU(2) realized as Sp(1). Here we explicitly compute the non-perturbative corrections to the D7/D3 system in type I' due to D-instantons. This computation provides both the quartic effective action on the D7 branes and the quadratic effective action on the D3 brane; the latter agrees with the F-theoretic prediction. The action obtained in this way is related to the one derived from the usual instanton calculus \`a la Nekrasov (or from its AGT realization in terms of Liouville conformal blocks) by means of a non-perturbative redefinition of the coupling constant. We also point out an intriguing relation between the four-dimensional theory on the probe D3 brane, which has a SO(8) flavor symmetry, and the eight-dimensional dynamics on the D7 branes. On the latter, SO(8) represents a gauge group and the flavor masses correspond to the vacuum expectation values of an adjoint scalar field m: what we find is that the exact effective coupling in four dimensions is obtained from its perturbative part by taking into account in its mass dependence the full quantum dynamics of the field m in eight dimensions.","Last couple of decades have been the golden age for cosmology.

Smectic and columnar ordering in length-polydisperse fluids of parallel hard cylinders,Nonlocal tensor order parameter of the deformed state of liquid crystals,True,"We apply a recently proposed density functional for mixtures of parallel hard cylinders, based on Rosenfeld's fundamental measure theory, to study the effect of length-polydispersity on the relative stability between the smectic and columnar liquid crystal phases.To this purpose we derive from this functional an expression for the direct correlation function and use it to perform a bifurcation analysis. We compare the results with those obtained with a second and a third virial approximation of this function. All three approximations lead to the same conclusion: there is a terminal polydispersity beyond which the smectic phase is less stable than the columnar phase. This result is in agreement with previous Monte Carlo simulations conducted on a freely rotating length-polydisperse hard spherocylinder fluid, although the theories always overestimate the terminal polydispersity because the nematic-columnar phase transition is first order and exhibits a wide coexistence gap. Both, the fundamental-measure functional and the third virial approximation, predict a metastable nematic-nematic demixing. Conversely, according to second virial approximation this demixing might be stable at high values of the polydispersity, something that is observed neither in simulations nor in experiments. The results of the fundamental-measure functional are quantitatively superior to those obtained from the other two approximations. Thus this functional provides a promising route to map out the full phase diagram of this system.","A generalized notion of a nonlocal tensor order parameter is introduced within the framework of the phenomenological approach. This parameter has the form of a traceless tensor correlation function or a tensor integral operator. Based on this form, the governing relations are written, which determine the steady states and phase transitions of the deformed liquid crystal. Linear relations for eigenfunctions of the introduced operator are derived. A principal drawback of currently available models of liquid crystals based on the local presentation of the tensor order parameter (equality of two Frank constants in the case of a quadratic form of the strain part of the free energy) is eliminated.

Universal relaxation function in nonextensive systems,Coarsening dynamics of binary liquids with active rotation,True,We have derived the dipolar relaxation function for a cluster model whose volume distribution was obtained from the generalized maximum Tsallis nonextensive entropy principle. The power law exponents of the relaxation function are simply related to a global fractal parameter $\alpha$ and for large time to the entropy nonextensivity parameter $q$. For intermediate times the relaxation follows a stretched exponential behavior. The asymptotic power law behaviors both in the time and the frequency domains coincide with those of the Weron generalized dielectric function derived from an extension of the Levy central limit theorem. They are in full agreement with the Jonscher universality principle. Moreover our model gives a physical interpretation of the mathematical parameters of the Weron stochastic theory and opens new paths to understand the ubiquity of self-similarity and power laws in the relaxation of large classes of materials in terms of their fractal and nonextensive properties.,"Active matter comprised of many self-driven units can exhibit emergent collective behaviors such as pattern formation and phase separation in both biologica and synthetic systems. While these behaviors are increasingly well understood for ensembles of linearly self-propelled particles, less is known about the collective behaviors of active rotating particles where energy input at the particle level gives rise to rotational particle motion. A recent simulation study revealed that active rotation can induce phase separation in mixtures of counter-rotating particles in 2D. In contrast to that of linearly self-propelled particles, the phase separation of counter-rotating fluids is accompanied by steady convective flows that originate at the fluid-fluid interface. Here, we investigate the influence of these flows on the coarsening dynamics of actively rotating binary liquids using a phenomenological, hydrodynamic model that combines a Cahn-Hilliard equation for the fluid composition with a Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. The effect of active rotation is introduced though an additional force within the Navier-Stokes equations that arises due to gradients in the concentrations of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating particles. Depending on the strength of active rotation and that of frictional interactions with the stationary surroundings, we observe and explain new dynamical behaviors such as ""active coarsening"" via self-generated flows as well as the emergence of self-propelled vortex doublets. We confirm that many of the qualitative behaviors identified by the continuum model can also be found in discrete, particle-based simulations of actively rotating liquids. Our results highlight further opportunities for achieving complex dissipative structures in active materials subject to distributed actuation.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Constructing Hubbard Models for the Hydrogen Chain using Sliced Basis DMRG,Vector chirality and inhomogeneous magnetization in frustrated spin tubes in high magnetic fields,True,"Sliced-basis DMRG(sb-DMRG) is used to simulate a chain of hydrogen atoms and to construct low-energy effective Hubbard-like models. The downfolding procedure first involves a change of basis to a set of atom-centered Wannier functions constructed from the natural orbitals of the exact DMRG one-particle density matrix. The Wannier function model is then reduced to a fewer-parameter Hubbard-like model, whose parameters are determined by minimizing the expectation value of the Wannier Hamiltonian in the ground state of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. This indirect variational procedure not only yields compact and simple models for the hydrogen chain, but also allows us to explore the importance of constraints in the effective Hamiltonian, such as the restricting the range of the single-particle hopping and two-particle interactions, and to assess the reliability of more conventional downfolding. The entanglement entropy for a model's ground state, cut in the middle, is an important property determining the ability of DMRG and tensor networks to simulate the model, and we study its variation with the range of the interactions. Counterintuitively, we find that shorter ranged interactions often have larger entanglement.","The low-energy physics of three-leg frustrated antiferromagnetic spin-S tubes in the vicinity of the upper critical field are studied. Utilizing the effective field theory based on the spin-wave approximation, we argue that in the intermediate-interchain-coupling regime, the ground state exhibits a vector chiral order or an inhomogeneous magnetization for the interchain (rung) direction and the low-energy excitations are described by a one-component Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL). In both chiral and inhomogeneous phases, the Z_2 parity symmetry along the rung direction is spontaneously broken. It is also predicted that a two-component TLL appears and all the symmetries are restored in the strong-rung-coupling case.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Dual Superconformal Symmetry of ${\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory with Fundamental Matter at Large $N$,On polynomial solutions of Heun equation,True,"Dual conformal symmetry and Yangian symmetry are symmetries of amplitudes that have aided the study of scattering amplitudes in highly supersymmetric theories like ${\cal N}=4$ SYM and ABJM. However, in general such symmetries are absent from the theories with lesser or no supersymmetry. In this paper, we show that the tree level $2\to 2$ scattering amplitude in the 3d ${\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to a fundamental chiral multiplet is dual superconformal invariant. In the 't Hooft large $N$ limit, the $2\to 2$ scattering amplitude in this theory has been shown to be tree-level exact in non-anyonic channels, while having only an overall multiplicative coupling dependent renormalisation in the anyonic channel. Therefore, the dual superconformal symmetry that we demonstrate in this paper is all loop exact. This is unlike the previously studied highly supersymmetric theories where dual superconformal symmetry is anomalous at loop levels. Furthermore, we reverse the argument to study the extent to which dual superconformal invariance fixes the scattering amplitude in an ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric theory. We demonstrate that requiring the dual superconformal invariance completely fixes the momentum dependence of the $2\to2$ amplitude, while the coupling constant dependence remain unfixed. Further, we use a combination of parity invariance, unitarity and self-duality of the amplitude to constrain the coupling dependence of scattering amplitude.","By making use of a recently developed method to solve linear differential equations of arbitrary order, we find a wide class of polynomial solutions to the Heun equation. We construct the series solution to the Heun equation before identifying the polynomial solutions.

Dynamic hybrid metasurfaces,Nanoscale probing of image-potential states and electron transfer doping in borophene polymorphs,True,"Efficient hybrid plasmonic-photonic metasurfaces that simultaneously take advantage of the potential of both pure metallic and all-dielectric nanoantennas are identified as an emerging technology in flat optics. Nevertheless, post-fabrication tunable hybrid metasurfaces are still elusive. Here, we present a reconfigurable hybrid metasurface platform by incorporating the phase-change material Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{5}$ (GST) into metal-dielectric meta-atoms for active and non-volatile tuning of properties of light. We systematically design a reduced-dimension meta-atom, which selectively controls the fundamental hybrid plasmonic-photonic resonances of the metasurface via the dynamic change of optical constants of GST without compromising the scattering efficiency. As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally demonstrate miniaturized tunable metasurfaces that control the amplitude and phase of incident light necessary for high-contrast optical switching and anomalous to specular beam deflection, respectively. Finally, we leverage a deep learning-based approach to present an intuitive low-dimensional visualization of the enhanced range of response reconfiguration enabled by the addition of GST. Our findings further substantiate dynamically tunable hybrid metasurfaces as promising candidates for the development of small-footprint energy harvesting, imaging, and optical signal processing devices.","Using field-emission resonance spectroscopy with an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope, we reveal Stark-shifted image-potential states of the v_1/6 and v_1/5 borophene polymorphs on Ag(111) with long lifetimes, suggesting high borophene lattice and interface quality. These image-potential states allow the local work function and interfacial charge transfer of borophene to be probed at the nanoscale and test the widely employed self-doping model of borophene. Supported by apparent barrier height measurements and density functional theory calculations, electron transfer doping occurs for both borophene phases from the Ag(111) substrate. In contradiction with the self-doping model, a higher electron transfer doping level occurs for denser v_1/6 borophene compared to v_1/5 borophene, thus revealing the importance of substrate effects on borophene electron transfer.",Applied Physics,"Applied physics focuses on applications of physics to new technology, including electronic devices, optics, photonics, microwaves, spintronics, advanced materials, metamaterials, nanotechnology, and energy sciences."
Diffuse Galactic Gamma Rays at intermediate and high latitudes. I. Constraints on the ISM properties,Broadband X-Ray Observations of the 2018 Outburst of the Changing-Look Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 1566,True,"We study the high latitude (|b|>10) diffuse gamma-ray emission in the Galaxy in light of the recently published data from the Fermi collaboration at energies between 100 MeV and 100 GeV. The unprecedented accuracy in these measurements allows to probe and constrain the properties of sources and propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) in the Galaxy, as well as confirming conventional assumptions made on the interstellar medium (ISM). Using the publicly available DRAGON code, that has been shown to reproduce local measurements of CRs, we study assumptions made in the literature on HI and H2 gas distributions in the ISM, and non spatially uniform models of diffusion in the Galaxy. By performing a combined analysis of CR and gamma-ray spectra, we derive constraints on the properties of the ISM gas distribution and the vertical scale height of galactic CR diffusion, which may have implications also on indirect Dark Matter detection. We also discuss some of the possible interpretations of the break at ~230 GV in CR protons and helium spectra, recently observed by PAMELA and their impact on gamma-rays.","We study the nature of the changing-look Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 1566 during its June 2018 outburst. During the outburst, the X-ray intensity of the source rises up to ~25-30 times compared to its quiescent state intensity. We perform timing and spectral analysis of the source during pre-outburst, outburst, and post-outburst epochs using semi-simultaneous observations with the XMM-Newton, Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), and Neil Gehrels Swift Observatories. We calculate variance, normalized variance, and fractional rms amplitude in different energy bands to study the variability. The broad-band 0.5-70 keV spectra are fitted with phenomenological models, as well as physical models. A strong soft X-ray excess is detected in the spectra during the outburst. The soft excess emission is found to be complex and could originate in the warm Comptonizing region in the inner accretion disc. We find that the increase in the accretion rate is responsible for the sudden rise in luminosity. This is supported by the q-shape of the hardness-intensity diagram that is generally found in outbursting black hole X-ray binaries. From our analysis, we find that NGC 1566 most likely harbours a low-spinning black hole with the spin parameter a* ~ 0.2.

"Neutrino Mass: Where Do We Stand, and Where Are We Going?",A SUSY GUT of Flavour with S4 x SU(5) to NLO,True,"We discuss the three major hints of neutrino mass: the strong evidence of mass from the behavior of atmospheric neutrinos, the very promising further hint from the behavior of solar neutrinos, and the so-far unconfirmed hint from the LSND experiment. Then, we describe two illustrative neutrino-mass scenarios suggested by the observed hints. We identify the needed future tests of both the present hints and the neutrino-mass scenarios.","We construct a Supersymmetric (SUSY) Grand Unified Theory (GUT) of Flavour based on S4 x SU(5), together with an additional (global or local) Abelian symmetry, and study it to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy.

Dynamical suppression of non-adiabatic modes,Landau meets Newton: time translation symmetry breaking in classical mechanics,True,"Recent analyses of the WMAP 5-year data constrain possible non-adiabatic contributions to the initial conditions of CMB anisotropies. Depending upon the early dynamics of the plasma, the amplitude of the entropic modes can experience a different suppression by the time of photon decoupling. Explicit examples of the latter observation are presented both analytically and numerically when the post-inflationary dynamics is dominated by a stiff contribution.","Every classical Newtonian mechanical system can be equipped with a nonstandard Hamiltonian structure, in which the Hamiltonian is the square of the canonical Hamiltonian up to a constant shift, and the Poisson bracket is nonlinear. In such a formalism, time translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, provided the potential function becomes negative. A nice analogy between time translation symmetry breaking and the Landau theory of second order phase transitions is established, together with several example cases illustrating time translation breaking ground states.

For the two-particle ground state, we focus on the effects of the interaction on the degeneracy, the spin density profiles, and the density-density correlation functions. Finally we show how these studies help us to understand the many-body properties of the system.",We report a thorough investigation of finite-temperature effects on three-body recombination near a triatomic Efimov resonance in an ultracold gas of cesium atoms. Our measurements cover a wide range from a near-ideal realization of the zero-temperature limit to a strongly temperature-dominated regime. The experimental results are analyzed within a recently introduced theoretical model based on a universal zero-range theory. The temperature-induced shift of the resonance reveals a contribution that points to an energy-dependence of the three-body parameter. We interpret this contribution in terms of the finite range of the van der Waals interaction in real atomic systems and we quantify it in an empirical way based on length scale arguments. A universal character of the corresponding resonance shift is suggested by observations related to other Efimov resonances and the comparison with a theoretical finite-temperature approach that explicitly takes the van der Waals interaction into account. Our findings are of importance for the precise determination of Efimov resonance positions from experiments at finite temperatures.,Quantum Gases,"Quantum gases in condensed matter physics focuses on ultracold atomic and molecular gases, Bose-Einstein condensation, Feshbach resonances, spinor condensates, optical lattices, quantum simulation with cold atoms and molecules, and macroscopic interference phenomena."
The Rest-Frame Optical Morphology of Emission Line Galaxies at 2 < z < 3: Evidence for Inside-Out Formation in Low-Mass Galaxies,Low-redshift Lyman continuum leaking galaxies with high [OIII]/[OII] ratios,True,"We compare the rest-frame ultraviolet and rest-frame optical morphologies of 2 < z < 3 star-forming galaxies in the GOODS-S field using Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS images from the CANDELS, GOODS, and ERS programs. We show that the distribution of sizes and concentrations for 1.90 < z < 2.35 galaxies selected via their rest-frame optical emission-lines are statistically indistinguishable from those of Lyman-alpha emitting systems found at z ~ 2.1 and z ~ 3.1. We also show that the z > 2 star-forming systems of all sizes and masses become smaller and more compact as one shifts the observing window from the UV to the optical. We argue that this offset is due to inside-out galaxy formation over the first ~ 2 Gyr of cosmic time.","We present observations with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope of five star-forming galaxies at redshifts z in the range 0.2993-0.4317 and with high emission-line flux ratios O32=[OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ~ 8-27 aiming to detect the Lyman continuum (LyC) emission.

A narrow Ly-alpha emission line with two peaks in four galaxies and with three peaks in one object is seen in medium-resolution COS spectra with a velocity separation between the peaks Vsep varying from ~153 km/s to ~345 km/s. We find a general increase of the LyC escape fraction with increasing O32 and decreasing stellar mass M*, but with a large scatter of fesc(LyC).

Technical Note: MC-GPU breast dosimetry validations with other Monte Carlo codes and Phase Space File implementation,Unsupervised Learning Methods in X-ray Spectral Imaging Material Segmentation,True,"Purpose: To validate the MC-GPU Monte Carlo code for dosimetric studies in x-ray breast imaging modalities: mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, contrast enhanced digital mammography and breast-CT. Moreover, to implement and validate a phase space file generation routine. Methods: The MC-GPU code (v. 1.5 DBT) was modified in order to generate phase space files and to be compatible with PENELOPE v. 2018 derived cross section database. Simulations were performed with homogeneous and anthropomorphic breast phantoms for different breast imaging techniques. The glandular dose was computed for each case and compared with results from the PENELOPE (v. 2014) + penEasy (v. 2015) and egs brachy (EGSnrc) Monte Carlo codes. Afterwards, several phase space files were generated with MC-GPU and the scored photon spectra were compared between the codes. Results: MC-GPU showed good agreement with the other codes when calculating the glandular dose distribution for mammography, mean glandular dose for digital breast tomosynthesis, and normalized glandular dose for breast-CT. The latter case showed average/maximum relative differences of 2.3%/27%, respectively, compared to other literature works, with the larger differences observed at low energies (around 10 keV). The recorded photon spectra entering a voxel were similar (within statistical uncertainties) between the three Monte Carlo codes. Conclusions: The results indicate that MC-GPU code is suitable for breast dosimetric studies for different x-ray breast imaging modalities, with the advantage of a high performance. The phase space file implementation was validated and is compatible with the IAEA standard, allowing multiscale Monte Carlo simulations with a combination of CPU and GPU codes.","In this work, we have investigated a number of unsupervised learning methods for material segmentation in projection x-ray imaging with a spectral detector. A phantom containing two hard materials (glass, steel) and three soft materials (PVC, polypropylene, and PFTE) all embedded in PMMA was imaged with a 5 energy bin spectal detector. The projection images were utilized to test nine unsupervised learning algorithms for automated material segmentation. Each algorithm was investigated using single energy (SE), dual energy (DE) and multi energy (ME) images. Clustering results were scored based on homogeneity and completeness of the clusters, which were combined into the Rosenberg and Hirshberg's V-measure. Principle component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) were tested as dimensional reduction methods. ME, DE and SE material segmentation was performed using five, two, and single energy images, respectively. ME had the highest V-measure on the soft materials using PCA and a novel interpolating bayesian gaussian mixture model (BGMM) clustering with a V-measure of 0.71. This was by 3.5% better than DE and 20.3% better than SE. Conversely, SE imaging was most capable of hard tissue segmentation using the standard BGMM, with a V-measures of 0.84. This was 6.3% better than DE and 5.0% better than ME. This work demonstrated that ME x-ray imaging might be superior in segmenting soft tissues compared to conventional SE x-ray imaging.",Medical Physics,"Medical physics focuses on radiation therapy.

A Physical Interpretation of MOND,The Structure of Hydrated Electron. Part 1. Magnetic Resonance of Internally Trapping Water Anions: A Density Functional Theory Study,True,"Earlier comparisons of galatic rotation curves with MOND have arrived at the conclusion that the parameter a_0 lies within ~20% of cH_0/2\pi, where c is the velocity of light and H_0 is the Hubble constant. It is proposed here that, for this value of H_0, signals propagating around the periphery of the Universe are phase locked by the graviton-nucleon interaction.","Density functional theory (DFT) is used to rationalize magnetic parameters of hydrated electron trapped in alkaline glasses as observed using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies. To this end, model water cluster anions (n=4-8 and n=20,24) that localize the electron internally are examined. It is shown that EPR parameters of such water anions (such as hyperfine coupling tensors of H/D nuclei in the water molecules) are defined mainly by the cavity size and the coordination number of the electron; the water molecules in the second solvation shell play a relatively minor role. An idealized model of hydrated electron (that is usually attributed to L. Kevan) in which six hydroxyl groups arranged in an octahedral pattern point towards the common center is shown to provide the closest match to the experimental parameters, such as isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants for the protons (estimated from ESEEM), the second moment of the EPR spectra, and the radius of gyration. The salient feature of these DFT models is the significant transfer (10-20%) of spin density into the frontal O 2p orbitals of water molecules. Spin bond polarization involving these oxygen orbitals accounts for small, negative hyperfine coupling constants for protons in hydroxyl groups that form the electron-trapping cavity. In Part 2, these results are generalized for more realistic geometries of core anions obtained using a dynamic one-electron mixed qunatum/classical molecular dynamics model.",General Physics,"General physics focuses on multidisciplinary topics, speculative ideas, and proposals that cover more than one area of physics.

Investigating signatures of cosmological time dilation in duration measures of prompt gamma-ray burst light curves,The intrinsic line width of the Fe Ka line of AGN,True,"We study the evolution with redshift of three measures of gamma-ray burst (GRB) duration ($T_{\rm 90}$, $T_{\rm 50}$ and $T_{\rm R45}$) in a fixed rest frame energy band for a sample of 232 Swift/BAT detected GRBs. Binning the data in redshift we demonstrate a trend of increasing duration with increasing redshift that can be modelled with a power-law for all three measures. Comparing redshift defined subsets of rest-frame duration reveals that the observed distributions of these durations are broadly consistent with cosmological time dilation. To ascertain if this is an instrumental effect, a similar analysis of Fermi/GBM data for the 57 bursts detected by both instruments is conducted, but inconclusive due to small number statistics. We then investigate under-populated regions of the duration redshift parameter space. We propose that the lack of low-redshift, long duration GRBs is a physical effect due to the sample being volume limited at such redshifts. However, we also find that the high-redshift, short duration region of parameter space suffers from censorship as any Swift GRB sample is fundamentally defined by trigger criteria determined in the observer frame energy band of Swift/BAT. As a result, we find that the significance of any evidence for cosmological time dilation in our sample of duration measures typically reduces to $<2\sigma$.","X-ray fluorescent lines are unique features of the reflection spectrum of the cold torus when irradiated by the central AGN. Their intrinsic line widths can be used to probe the line-emitting region. The line widths of the Fe \Ka line measured from the first order Chandra High Energy Grating (HEG) spectra are $3-5$ times larger than those measured with the Si \Ka line for Circinus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068. Because the observed Si \Ka and Fe \Ka lines are not necessarily coming from the same physical region, it is uncertain whether the line widths of the Fe \Ka line are over-estimated or not. We measured the intrinsic line widths of the Fe \Ka line of several nearby bright AGN using the second and third order Chandra HEG spectra, whose spectral resolutions are better than the first order data. We found the measured widths are all smaller than those from the first order data. The results clearly show that the widths of the Fe \Ka line measured from the first order HEG data are over-estimated.

Rotational Symmetry Protected Edge and Corner States in Abelian topological phases,Interlayer Pairing Symmetry of Composite Fermions in Quantum Hall Bilayers,True,"Spatial symmetries can enrich the topological classification of interacting quantum matter and endow systems with non-trivial strong topological invariants (protected by internal symmetries) with additional ""weak"" topological indices. In this paper, we study the edge physics of systems with a non-trivial shift invariant, which is protected by either a continuous $\text{U}(1)_r$ or discrete $\text{C}_n$ rotation symmetry, along with internal $\text{U}(1)_c$ charge conservation. Specifically, we construct an interface between two systems which have the same Chern number but are distinguished by their Wen-Zee shift and, through analytic arguments supported by numerics, show that the interface hosts counter-propagating gapless edge modes which cannot be gapped by arbitrary local symmetry-preserving perturbations. Using the Chern-Simons field theory description of two-dimensional Abelian topological orders, we then prove sufficient conditions for continuous rotation symmetry protected gapless edge states using two complementary approaches. One relies on the algebraic Lagrangian sub-algebra framework for gapped boundaries while the other uses a more physical flux insertion argument. For the case of discrete rotation symmetries, we extend the field theory approach to show the presence of fractional corner charges for Abelian topological orders with gappable edges, and compute them in the case where the Abelian topological order is placed on the two-dimensional surface of a Platonic solid. Our work paves the way for studying the edge physics associated with spatial symmetries in symmetry enriched topological phases.","We study the pairing symmetry of the interlayer paired state of composite fermions in quantum Hall bilayers. Based on the Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) theory, the effect of the long-range Coulomb interaction and the internal Chern-Simons gauge fluctuation is analyzed with the random-phase approximation beyond the leading order contribution in small momentum expansion, and we observe that the interlayer paired states with a relative angular momentum $l=+1$ are energetically favored for filling $\nu=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}$.

Probing the Hofstadter butterfly with the quantum oscillation of magnetization,Combined analytical and numerical approach to magnetization plateaux in one-dimensional spin tube antiferromagnets,True,"We have developed a different quantum transfer matrix method to accurately determine thermodynamic properties of the Hofstadter model. This method resolves a technical problem which is intractable by other methods and makes the calculation of physical quantities of the Hofstadter model in the thermodynamic limit at finite temperatures feasible. It is shown that the quantum correction to the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation of magnetization bears the energy structure of Hofstadter butterfly. The measurement of this quantum correction, which can be materialized on the superlattice or cold atom systems, can reveal unambiguously the Hofstadter fractal energy spectrum.","In this paper, we investigate the properties of frustrated three-leg spin tubes under a magnetic field.

Maximum Spin of Black Holes Driving Jets,Kinematics of MgII Absorbers from the Redshift-space Distortion Around Massive Quiescent Galaxies,True,"Unbounded outflows in the form of highly collimated jets and broad winds appear to be a ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems. The most powerful jets are thought to derive a significant fraction, if not the majority, of their power from the rotational energy of the black hole. Whatever the precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must therefore exert a braking torque on the black hole. We calculate the spin-up function for an accreting black hole, accounting for this braking torque. We find that the predicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole spin and dimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using recent relativistic magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulation results to calibrate the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the flow, we find that an ADAF flow will spin a black hole up (or down) to an equilibrium value of about 96% of the maximal spin value in the absence of jets. Combining our ADAF system with a simple model for jet power, we demonstrate that an equilibrium is reached at approximately 93% of the maximal spin value, as found in the numerical simulation studies of the spin-up of accreting black holes, at which point the spin-up of the hole by accreted material is balanced by the braking torque arising from jet production. Our model also yields a relationship between jet efficiency and black hole spin that is in surprisingly good agreement with that seen in the simulation studies, indicating that our simple model is a useful and convenient description of ADAF inflow - jet outflow about a spinning black hole for incorporation in models of the formation and evolution of galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies.","The kinematics of MgII absorbers is the key to understanding the origin of cool, metal-enriched gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium of massive quiescent galaxies. Exploiting the fact that the cloud line-of-sight velocity distribution is the only unknown for predicting the redshift-space distortion~(RSD) of MgII absorbers from their 3D real-space distribution around galaxies, we develop a novel method to infer the cool cloud kinematics from the redshift-space galaxy-cloud cross-correlation $\xi^{s}$. We measure $\xi^{s}$ for ${\sim}10^4$ MgII absorbers around ${\sim}8{\times}10^5$ CMASS galaxies at $0.4{<}z{<}0.8$. We discover that $\xi^{s}$ does not exhibit a strong Fingers-of-God effect, but is heavily truncated at velocity ${\sim}300\,km/s$. We reconstruct both the redshift and real-space cloud number density distributions inside haloes, $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ and $\xi_{1h}$, respectively. Thus, for any model of cloud kinematics, we can predict $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ from the reconstructed $\xi_{1h}$, and self-consistently compare to the observed $\xi^{s}_{1h}$. We consider four types of cloud kinematics, including an isothermal model with a single velocity dispersion, a satellite infall model in which cool clouds reside in the subhaloes, a cloud accretion model in which clouds follow the cosmic gas accretion, and a tired wind model in which clouds originate from the galactic wind-driven bubbles. All the four models provide statistically good fits to the RSD data, but only the tired wind model can reproduce the observed truncation by propagating ancient wind bubbles at ${\sim}250\,km/s$ on scales ${\sim}400\,kpc/h$.

Hyper-order baryon number fluctuations at finite temperature and density,Accurate nuclear radii and binding energies from a chiral interaction,True,"Fluctuations of conserved charges are sensitive to the QCD phase transition and a possible critical endpoint in the phase diagram at finite density. In this work, we compute the baryon number fluctuations up to tenth order at finite temperature and density. This is done in a QCD-assisted effective theory that accurately captures the quantum- and in-medium effects of QCD at low energies. A direct computation at finite density allows us to assess the applicability of expansions around vanishing density. By using different freeze-out scenarios in heavy-ion collisions, we translate these results into baryon number fluctuations as a function of collision energy. We show that a non-monotonic energy dependence of baryon number fluctuations can arise in the non-critical crossover region of the phase diagram. Our results compare well with recent experimental measurements of the kurtosis and the sixth-order cumulant of the net-proton distribution from the STAR collaboration. They indicate that the experimentally observed non-monotonic energy dependence of fourth-order net-proton fluctuations is highly non-trivial. It could be an experimental signature of an increasingly sharp chiral crossover and may indicate a QCD critical point. The physics implications and necessary upgrades of our analysis are discussed in detail.","With the goal of developing predictive ab-initio capability for light and medium-mass nuclei, two-nucleon and three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory are optimized simultaneously to low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering data, as well as binding energies and radii of few-nucleon systems and selected isotopes of carbon and oxygen. Coupled-cluster calculations based on this interaction, named NNLO$_{\rm sat}$, yield accurate binding energies and radii of nuclei up to $^{40}$Ca, and are consistent with the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter. In addition, the low-lying collective $J^\pi=3^-$ states in $^{16}$O and $^{40}$Ca are described accurately, while spectra for selected $p$- and $sd$-shell nuclei are in reasonable agreement with experiment.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Quantum creation of traversable wormholes ex nihilo in Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton gravity,Surface Operators in Superspace,True,"We investigate a nucleation of a Euclidean wormhole and its analytic continuation to Lorentzian signatures in Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton gravity, where this model can be embedded by the type-II superstring theory. We show that there exists a Euclidean wormhole solution in this model by choosing a suitable shape of the dilaton potential. After the analytic continuation, this explains a quantum creation of a time-like traversable wormhole. Finally, we discuss relations to the information loss problem and the current literature.","We generalize the geometrical formulation of Wilson loops recently introduced in arXiv:2003.01729v2 to the description of Wilson Surfaces. For N=(2,0) theory in six dimensions, we provide an explicit derivation of BPS Wilson Surfaces with non-trivial coupling to scalars, together with their manifestly supersymmetric version. We derive explicit conditions which allow to classify these operators in terms of the number of preserved supercharges. We also discuss kappa-symmetry and prove that BPS conditions in six dimensions arise from kappa-symmetry invariance in eleven dimensions. Finally, we discuss super-Wilson Surfaces - and higher dimensional operators - as objects charged under global $p$-form (super)symmetries generated by tensorial supercurrents. To this end, the construction of conserved supercurrents in supermanifolds and of the corresponding conserved charges is developed in details.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

The scaling relations of galaxies back in time: the road toward virialization,Multi-epoch properties of the warm absorber in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 985,True,"Context. The structural scaling relations (SSRs) of galaxies, i.e. the observed correlations between effective radius, effective surface intensity and velocity dispersion, are important tools for understanding how evolution proceeds. Aims. In this paper we aim to demonstrate that the evolution of the SSRs back in time is governed by the combination of the virial theorem (VT) and the relation $L=L'_0 \sigma^{\beta(t)}$, where the parameters $\beta$ and $L'_0$ vary with time and from galaxy to galaxy. Methods. Using the WINGS database for the galaxies at redshift $z=0$ and the Illustris-1 and Illustris-TNG databases of artificial galaxies, for the galaxies up to redshift $z=4$, we analyse the SSRs back in time and, by means of simple algebraic expressions for $L'_0$ and $\beta$ (functions of time and other physical quantities), we derive the expected paths followed by galaxies in the various SSRs toward the distributions observed at $z=0$. Results. The distribution of galaxies in the SSRs is ultimately related to the evolution in luminosity and velocity dispersion that are empirically mirrored by the $L=L'_0 \sigma^{\beta(t)}$ law. Furthermore, the $\beta$ parameter works as a thermometer of the virialization of a galaxy. This parameter can assume either positive or negative values, and its absolute value attains high values when the galaxy is close to the virial condition, while it tends to zero when the galaxy is far from it. Conclusions. As the SSRs change with time, the method we are proposing allows us to decipher the temporal evolution of galaxies.","(Abridged) NGC 985 was observed by XMM-Newton twice in 2015, revealing that the source was coming out from a soft X-ray obscuration event that took place in 2013. These kinds of events are possibly recurrent since a previous XMM-Newton archival observation in 2003 also showed signatures of partial obscuration. We have analyzed the high-resolution X-ray spectra of NGC 985 obtained by the RGS in 2003, 2013, and 2015 in order to characterize the ionized absorbers superimposed to the continuum and to study their response as the ionizing flux varies. We found that up to four warm absorber (WA) components were present in the grating spectra of NGC 985, plus a mildy ionized (log xi ranging between 0.2 and 0.5) obscuring (log N(H) of about 22.3) wind outflowing at about 6000 km/s. The absorbers have a log N(H) ranging from 21 to about 22.5, and ionization parameters ranging from 1.6 to 2.9. The most ionized component is also the fastest, moving away at 5100 km/s, while the others outflow in two kinematic regimes, at about 600 and 350 km/s. These components showed variability at different time scales in response to changes in the ionizing continuum. Assuming that these changes are due to photoionization we have obtained upper and lower limits on the density of the gas and therefore on its distance, finding that the closest two components are at pc-scale distances, while the rest may extend up to tens of pc from the central source. The fastest, most ionized WA component accounts for the bulk of the kinetic luminosity injected back into the ISM of the host galaxy, which is on the order of 0.8% of the bolometric luminosity of NGC 985. According to the models, this amount of kinetic energy per unit time would be sufficient to account for cosmic feedback.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Curvature relations in almost product manifolds,Origin of the tail in Green's functions in odd dimensional space-times,True,New relations involving curvature components for the various connections appearing in the theory of almost product manifolds are given and the conformal behaviour of these connections are studied. New identities for the irreducible parts of the deformation tensor are derived. Some direct physical applications in Kaluza-Klein and gauge theory are discussed.,"It is well known that the scalar field Green's function in odd dimensions has a tail, i.e. a non-zero support inside the light cone, which in turn implies that the Huygens' principle is violated. However, the reason behind this behavior is still not quite clear. In this paper we shed more light on the physical origin of the tail by regularizing the term which is usually ignored in the literature since it vanishes due to the action of the delta function. With this extra term the Green's function does not satisfy the source-free wave equation (in the region outside of the source). We show that this term corresponds to a charge imprinted on the light cone shell. Unlike the vector field charge, a moving scalar field charge is not Lorentz invariant and is contracted by the relativistic $\sqrt{1-v^2}$ factor. If a scalar charge is moving at the speed of light, it appears to be zero in the static (with respect to the original physical charge) observer's frame. However, the field it sources is not entirely on the light cone. Thus, it is likely that this hidden charge sources the mysterious tail in odd dimensions.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Noncommutative gauge theories on $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$: Perturbatively finite models,Non-Abelian cosmic strings in de Sitter and anti-de Sitter space,True,"We show that natural noncommutative gauge theory models on $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$ can accommodate gauge invariant harmonic terms, thanks to the existence of a relationship between the center of $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$ and the components of the gauge invariant 1-form canonical connection. This latter object shows up naturally within the present noncommutative differential calculus. Restricting ourselves to positive actions with covariant coordinates as field variables, a suitable gauge-fixing leads to a family of matrix models with quartic interactions and kinetic operators with compact resolvent. Their perturbative behavior is then studied. We first compute the 2-point and 4-point functions at the one-loop order within a subfamily of these matrix models for which the interactions have a symmetric form. We find that the corresponding contributions are finite. We then extend this result to arbitrary order. We find that the amplitudes of the ribbon diagrams for the models of this subfamily are finite to all orders in perturbation. This result extends finally to any of the models of the whole family of matrix models obtained from the above gauge-fixing. The origin of this result is discussed. Finally, the existence of a particular model related to integrable hierarchies is indicated, for which the partition function is expressible as a product of ratios of determinants.","In this paper we investigate the non-Abelian cosmic string in de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes. In order to do that we construct the complete set of equations of motion considering the presence of a cosmological constant. By using numerical analysis we provide the behavior of the Higgs and gauge fields and also for the metric tensor for specific values of the physical parameters of the theory. For de Sitter case, we find the appearance of horizons that although being consequence of the presence of the cosmological constant it strongly depends on the value of the gravitational coupling. In the anti-de Sitter case, we find that the system does not present horizons. In fact the new feature of this system is related with the behavior of the $(00)$ and $(zz)$ components of the metric tensor. They present a strongly increasing for large distance from the string.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

The influence of anisotropy on the evolution of interfacial morphologies in directional solidification: A phase-field study,Breaking rate minimum predicts the collapse point of over-loaded materials,True,"By adjusting the interface energy, curvature, and velocity, the anisotropy plays an important role in the interaction between interfacial processes and transport processes, determining the solidification structures. In this paper, through the quantitative phase-field model, the influence of anisotropy on the evolution of interfacial morphologies in directional solidification is investigated. To represent different interfacial anisotropies, the solidification processes with different preferred crystallographic orientations are performed. Then the effect of anisotropy on morphological evolution is discussed systematically. At the planar growth stage, the interfacial anisotropy makes no difference in the transport processes and morphological evolution. At the onset time of planar instability, the anisotropy determines the detailed evolution by adjusting the interface stiffness. At the planar-cellular-transition stage, with the influence of anisotropy, the interfacial curvature decreases from {\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}. Hence, the solute concentration ahead of the interface increases from {\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}, while the instantaneous velocity of the interface decreases from {\theta}0=0{\deg} to {\theta}0=40{\deg}. At the quasi-steady-state stage, the anisotropy determines the growth direction and tip velocity of the primary dendrite, as well as the onset of sidebranches.","As a model of composite materials, we choose a bundle of fibers with stochastically distributed breaking thresholds for the individual fibers. the fibers are assumed to share the load equally and to obey Hookean elasticity right up to the breaking point.

Redistribution of electronic charges in spin-Peierls state in (TMTTF)2AsF6 observed by 13C NMR,Visualizing pair formation on the atomic scale in the high-Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d,True,"We report ^{13}C NMR spectra and nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate 1/T_1 for a quasi-one-dimensional quarter-filled organic material (TMTTF)_{2}AsF_{6}, which undergoes charge ordering (T_{{CO}} = 102 K) and spin-Peierls phase transitions (T_{{SP}} = 14 K). The ratio of two 1/T_1 for the charge accepting and donating TMTTF sites which grows from T_{CO} finally saturates in approaching T_{{SP}}, indicating one spin correlation function even in the charge ordered state. Below T_{{SP}}, however, the doubly split NMR lines from inequivalently charged molecules merge into one line, originated from the variation in charge densities. This shows that a rearrangement of the charge configuration occurs at T_{{SP}}.","Pairing of electrons in conventional superconductors occurs at the superconducting transition temperature Tc, creating an energy gap D in the electronic density of states (DOS). In the high-Tc superconductors, a partial gap in the DOS exists for a range of temperatures above Tc. A key question is whether the gap in the DOS above Tc is associated with pairing, and what determines the temperature at which incoherent pairs form. Here we report the first spatially resolved measurements of gap formation in a high-Tc superconductor, measured on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d samples with different Tc values (hole concentration of 0.12 to 0.22) using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Over a wide range of doping from 0.16 to 0.22 we find that pairing gaps nucleate in nanoscale regions above Tc. These regions proliferate as the temperature is lowered, resulting in a spatial distribution of gap sizes in the superconducting state. Despite the inhomogeneity, we find that every pairing gap develops locally at a temperature Tp, following the relation 2D/kBTp = 8. At very low doping (<0.14), systematic changes in the DOS indicate the presence of another phenomenon, which is unrelated and perhaps competes with electron pairing. Our observation of nanometre-sized pairing regions provides the missing microscopic basis for understanding recent reports of fluctuating superconducting response above Tc in hole-doped high-Tc copper oxide superconductors.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Using the Dipolar and Quadrupolar Moments to Improve Solar-Cycle Predictions Based on the Polar Magnetic Fields,Ultra-Wideband Detection of 22 Coherent Radio Bursts on M Dwarfs,True,"The solar cycle and its associated magnetic activity are the main drivers behind changes in the interplanetary environment and Earth's upper atmosphere (commonly referred to as space weather and climate). In recent years there has been an effort to develop accurate solar cycle predictions, leading to nearly a hundred widely spread predictions for the amplitude of solar cycle 24. Here we show that cycle predictions can be made more accurate if performed separately for each hemisphere, taking advantage of information about both the dipolar and quadrupolar moments of the solar magnetic field during minimum.","Coherent radio bursts detected from M dwarfs have some analogy with solar radio bursts, but reach orders of magnitude higher luminosities. These events trace particle acceleration, powered by magnetic reconnection, shock fronts (such as formed by coronal mass ejections, CMEs), and magnetospheric currents, in some cases offering the only window into these processes in stellar atmospheres. We conducted a 58-hour, ultra-wideband survey for coherent radio bursts on 5 active M dwarfs. We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to observe simultaneously in three frequency bands covering a subset of 224-482 MHz and 1-6 GHz, achieving the widest fractional bandwidth to date for any observations of stellar radio bursts. We detected 22 bursts across 13 epochs, providing the first large sample of wideband dynamic spectra of stellar coherent radio bursts. The observed bursts have diverse morphology, with durations ranging from seconds to hours, but all share strong (40-100%) circular polarization. No events resemble solar Type II bursts (often associated with CMEs), but we cannot rule out the occurrence of radio-quiet stellar CMEs. The hours-long bursts are all polarized in the sense of the x-mode of the star's large-scale magnetic field, suggesting they are cyclotron maser emission from electrons accelerated in the large-scale field, analogous to auroral processes on ultracool dwarfs. The duty cycle of luminous coherent bursts peaks at 25% at 1-1.4 GHz, declining at lower and higher frequencies, indicating source regions in the low corona.

On the connection between the intergalactic medium and galaxies: The HI-galaxy cross-correlation at z < 1,Reducing Zero-point Systematics in Dark Energy Supernova Experiments,True,"We present a new optical spectroscopic survey of 1777 'star-forming' ('SF') and 366 'non-star-forming' ('non-SF') galaxies at redshifts z < 1 (2143 in total), 22 AGN and 423 stars, observed by instruments such as DEIMOS, VIMOS and GMOS, in 3 fields containing 5 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) with HST UV spectroscopy. We also present a new spectroscopic survey of 165 'strong' (10^14 < NHI < 10^17 cm^-2), and 489 'weak' (10^13 < NHI < 10^14 cm^-2) intervening HI absorption line systems at z < 1 (654 in total), observed in the spectra of 8 QSOs by COS and FOS on the HST. Combining these new data with previously published galaxy catalogs such as VVDS and GDDS, we have gathered a sample of 654 HI absorption systems and 17509 galaxies at transverse scales < 50 Mpc. We present observational results on the HI-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy correlations at transverse scales r < 10 Mpc, and the HI-HI auto-correlation at transverse scales r < 2 Mpc. The two-point correlation functions are measured both along and transverse to the line-of-sight. We constrain the HI-galaxy statistical connection, as a function of both HI column density and galaxy star-forming activity. Our results are consistent with the following conclusions: (1) the bulk of HI systems on Mpc scales have little velocity dispersion (<120 km/s) with respect to the bulk of galaxies; (2) the vast majority of strong HI systems and SF galaxies are distributed in the same locations, together with 75+-15% of non-SF galaxies, all of which typically reside in dark matter haloes of similar masses; (3) 25+-15% of non-SF galaxies reside in galaxy clusters and are not correlated with strong HI systems at scales < 2 Mpc; and (4) 50% of weak HI systems reside within galaxy voids (hence not correlated with galaxies), and are confined in dark matter haloes of masses smaller than those hosting...

Low-energy effective action for pions and a dilatonic meson,Quantization of Fields by Averaging Classical Evolution Equations,True,"Numerical simulations of QCD-like theories in which the number of flavors is adjusted so that the beta function is very small, but confinement and chiral symmetry breaking nevertheless take place, appear to reveal the presence of a flavor-singlet scalar meson which can be as light as the pions. Because the breaking of dilatation symmetry, quantified by the beta function, is small relative to QCD, a possible explanation is that the scalar meson is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the approximate dilatation symmetry. We use this observation to systematically develop a low-energy effective action that accounts for both the pions and the ""dilatonic"" scalar meson. In order to justify the power counting that controls the couplings of the dilatonic meson we invoke the Veneziano limit, in which the number of fundamental-representation flavors $N_f$ grows in proportion with the number of colors $N_c$, while the ratio $N_f/N_c$ is kept close to, but below, the critical value where the conformal window is entered.","This paper extends the formalism for quantizing field theories via a microcanonical quantum field theory and Hamilton's principle to classical evolution equations. These are based on the well-known correspondence under a Wick rotation between quantum field theories and 4-D statistical mechanical theories. By placing quantum field theories on a 4+1-D under Wick rotation to 5-D, expectations of observables are calculated for a microcanonical field theory averaging Hamiltonian flow over a fifth spacelike dimension, a technique common in lattice gauge simulations but not in perturbation theory. In a novel demonstration, averaging pairs of external lines in the classical Feynman diagrams over the fifth dimension generates diagrams with loops and vacuum fluctuations identical to Standard Model diagrams. Because it is microcanonical, this approach, while equivalent for standard quantum fields theories in the Standard Model, is able to quantize theories that have no canonical quantization. It is also unique in representing expectations as averages over solutions to an ordinary, classical PDE rather than a path integral or operator based approaches. Hence, this approach draws a clear connection between quantum field theory and classical field theory in higher dimensions which has implications towards how quantum effects are interpreted. In particular, it raises questions about how violations of the ergodic hypothesis could influence quantum measurements even in standard, non-statistical quantum field theory.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Statistical Analysis for Long Term Correlations in the Stress Time Series of Jerky Flow,Classification of interest rate curves using Self-Organising Maps,True,"Stress time series from the PLC effect typically exhibit stick-slips of upload and download type. These data contain strong short-term correlations of a nonlinear type. We investigate whether there are also long term correlations, i.e. the successive up-down patterns are generated by a deterministic mechanism. A statistical test is conducted for the null hypothesis that the sequence of the up-down patterns is totally random. The test is constructed by means of surrogate data, suitably generated to represent the null hypothesis. Linear and nonlinear estimates are used as test statistics, namely autocorrelation, mutual information and Lyapunov exponents, which are found to have proper performance for the test. The test is then applied to three stress time series under different experimental conditions. Rejections are obtained for one of them and not with all statistics. From the overall results we cannot conclude that the underlying mechanism to the PLC effect has long memory.","The present study deals with the analysis and classification of interest rate curves.

Operatorial characterization of Majorana neutrinos,Single Field Baryogenesis,True,"The Majorana neutrino $\psi_{M}(x)$ when constructed as a superposition of chiral fermions such as $\nu_{L} + C\overline{\nu_{L}}^{T}$ is characterized by $ ({\cal C}{\cal P}) \psi_{M}(x)({\cal C}{\cal P})^{\dagger} =i\gamma^{0}\psi_{M}(t,-\vec{x})$, and the CP symmetry describes the entire physics contents of Majorana neutrinos. Further specifications of C and P separately could lead to difficulties depending on the choice of C and P. The conventional $ {\cal C} \psi_{M}(x) {\cal C}^{\dagger} = \psi_{M}(x)$ with well-defined P is naturally defined when one constructs the Majorana neutrino from the Dirac-type fermion. In the seesaw model of Type I or Type I+II where the same number of left- and right-handed chiral fermions appear, it is possible to use the generalized Pauli-Gursey transformation to rewrite the seesaw Lagrangian in terms of Dirac-type fermions only; the conventional C symmetry then works to define Majorana neutrinos. In contrast, the ""pseudo C-symmetry"" $\nu_{L,R}(x)\rightarrow C\overline{\nu_{L,R}(x)}^{T}$ (and associated ""pseudo P-symmetry""), that has been often used in both the seesaw model and Weinberg's model to describe Majorana neutrinos, attempts to assign a nontrivial charge conjugation transformation rule to each chiral fermion separately. But this common construction is known to be operatorially ill-defined and, for example, the amplitude of the neutrinoless double beta decay vanishes if the vacuum is assumed to be invariant under the pseudo C-symmetry.","We propose a new variant of the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis mechanism in which a rolling scalar field couples directly to left- and right-handed neutrinos, generating a Dirac mass term through neutrino Yukawa interactions. In this setup, there are no explicitly CP violating couplings in the Lagrangian. The rolling scalar field is also taken to be uncharged under the $B - L$ quantum numbers.

Quantum model for mode locking in pulsed semiconductor quantum dots,Anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect: the topological inequivalence of skin modes versus point gap,True,"Quantum dots in GaAs/InGaAs structures have been proposed as a candidate system for realizing quantum computing. The short coherence time of the electronic quantum state that arises from coupling to the nuclei of the substrate is dramatically increased if the system is subjected to a magnetic field and to repeated optical pulsing. This enhancement is due to mode locking: Oscillation frequencies resonant with the pulsing frequencies are enhanced, while off-resonant oscillations eventually die out. Because the resonant frequencies are determined by the pulsing frequency only, the system becomes immune to frequency shifts caused by the nuclear coupling and by slight variations between individual quantum dots. The effects remain even after the optical pulsing is terminated. In this work, we explore the phenomenon of mode locking from a quantum mechanical perspective. We treat the dynamics using the central spin model, which includes coupling to 10-20 nuclei and incoherent decay of the excited electronic state, in a perturbative framework. Using scaling arguments, we extrapolate our results to realistic system parameters. We find that the synchronization to the pulsing frequency needs time scales in the order of 1 s.","Non-Hermitian skin effect, the localization of an extensive number of eigenstates at the ends of the system, has greatly expanded the frontier of physical laws. It has long been believed that the present of skin modes is equivalent to the topologically nontrivial point gap of complex eigenvalues under periodic boundary conditions, and vice versa. However, we find that this concomitance can be broken, i.e., the skin modes can be present or absent whereas the point gap is topologically trivial or nontrivial, respectively, named anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect. This anomalous phenomenon arises when the unidirectional hopping amplitudes leading to the decoupling-like behaviors among subsystems are emergence. The emergence of the anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect is accompanied by the mutations of the open boundary energy spectrum, whose structure exhibits the multifold exceptional point and can not be recovered by continuum bands. Moreover, an experimental setup using circuits is proposed to simulate this novel quantum effect. Our results reveal the topologically inequivalent between skin modes and point gap.

Valence and Spin fluctuations in Mn-doped ferroelectric BaTiO3,Valley lifetimes of conduction band electrons in monolayer WSe$_2$,True,"We study Mn substitution for Ti in BaTiO3 with and without compensating oxygen vacancies using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). We find strong charge and spin fluctuations. Without compensating oxygen vacancies, the ground state is found to be a quantum superposition of two distinct atomic valences, 3d4 and 3d5. Introducing a compensating oxygen vacancy at a neighboring site reduces both charge and spin fluctuations due to the reduction of electron hopping from Mn to its ligands. As a consequence, valence fluctuations are reduced, and is closely fixed to the high spin 3d5 state. Here we show that inclusion of charge and spin fluctuations is necessary to obtain an accurate ground state of transition metal doped ferroelectrics.","One of the main tasks in the investigation of 2-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is the determination of valley lifetimes. In this work, we combine time-resolved Kerr rotation with electrical transport measurements to explore the gate-dependent valley lifetimes of free conduction band electrons of monolayer WSe$_2$. When tuning the Fermi energy into the conduction band we observe a strong decrease of the respective valley lifetimes which is consistent with both spin-orbit and electron-phonon scattering. We explain the formation of a valley polarization by the scattering of optically excited valley polarized bright trions into dark states by intervalley scattering. Furthermore, we show that the conventional time-resolved Kerr rotation measurement scheme has to be modified to account for photo-induced gate screening effects. Disregarding this adaptation can lead to erroneous conclusions drawn from gate-dependent optical measurements and can completely mask the true gate-dependent valley dynamics.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Negative-mass exciton polaritons induced by dissipative light-matter coupling in an atomically thin semiconductor,Resonantly induced friction in driven nanomechanical systems,True,"Dispersion engineering is a powerful and versatile tool that can vary the speed of light signals and induce negative-mass effects in the dynamics of particles and quasiparticles. Here, we show that dissipative coupling between bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and photons in an optical microcavity can lead to the formation of exciton polaritons with an inverted dispersion of the lower polariton branch and hence a negative mass. We perform direct measurements of the anomalous dispersion in atomically thin (monolayer) WS$_2$ crystals embedded in planar microcavities and demonstrate that the propagation direction of the negative-mass polaritons is opposite to their momentum. Our study introduces a new concept of non-Hermitian dispersion engineering for exciton polaritons and opens a pathway for realising new phases of quantum matter in a solid state.","We propose a new mechanism of friction in resonantly driven vibrational systems. The form of the friction force follows from the time- and spatial-symmetry arguments. We consider a microscopic mechanism of this resonant force in nanomechanical systems. The friction can be negative, leading to an instability of forced vibrations of a nanoresonator and the onset of self-sustained oscillations in the rotating frame.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Insights into the Unusual Semiconducting Behavior in Low-Dimensional Boron,Superconducting Fluctuation Corrections to the Thermal Current in Granular Metals,True,"Elementary semiconductors are rare and attractive, especially for low-dimensional materials. Unfortunately, most of boron nanostructures were found to be metallic, despite of their typical semiconducting bulk structure. Herein, we propose a general recipe to realize low-dimensional semiconducting boron. This unusual semiconducting behavior is attributed to charge transfer and electron localization, induced by the symmetry breaking that divides boron atoms into cations and anions. In addition, it is feasible to accomplish band gap engineering by rationally designing various structures. Importantly, the low-dimensional semiconducting boron are predicted to be an excellent solar-cell material with the power conversion efficiency of higher than 20%, paving the way for their promising optoelectronic applications.","The first-order superconducting fluctuation corrections to the thermal conductivity of a granular metal are calculated. A suppression of thermal conductivity proportional to $T_c/(T-T_c)$ is observed in a region not too close to the critical temperature $T_c$. As $T\simeq T_c$, a saturation of the correction is found, and its sign depends on the ratio between the barrier transparency and the critical temperature. In both regimes, the Wiedemann-Franz law is violated.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Galaxy clustering constraints on deviations from Newtonian gravity at cosmological scales,"Confinement, Glueballs and Strings from Deformed AdS",True,"In spite of the growing observational evidence for dark matter and dark energy in the universe, their physical nature is largely unknown. In fact, several authors have proposed modifications of Newton's law of gravity at cosmological scales to account for the apparent acceleration of the cosmic expansion. Inspired by such suggestions, we attempt to constrain possible deviations from Newtonian gravity by means of the clustering of SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) galaxies. To be specific, we assume a simple modification of Newton's law with an additional Yukawa-type term characterized by the amplitude \alpha and the length scale \lambda. Adopting spatially-flat universes dominated by cold dark matter and/or dark energy, we solve a linear perturbation equation for the growth of density fluctuations. In particular, we find an exact analytic solution for the Einstein -- de Sitter case. Following the Peacock-Dodds prescription, we compute the nonlinear power spectra of mass fluctuations, perform a statistical comparison with the SDSS galaxy data, and derive constraints in the \alpha-\lambda plane; for instance, we obtain the constraints of -0.5<\alpha <0.6 and -0.8<\alpha<0.9 (99.7% confidence level) for \lambda=5h^{-1}Mpc and 10h^{-1}Mpc, respectively. We also discuss several future possibilities for improving our analysis.","We study aspects of confinement in two deformed versions of the AdS/CFT correspondence - the GPPZ dual of N=1* Yang Mills, and the Yang Mills* N=0 dual. Both geometries describe discrete glueball spectra which we calculate numerically. The results agree at the 10% level with previous AdS/CFT computations in the Klebanov Strassler background and AdS Schwarzchild respectively. We also calculate the spectra of bound states of the massive fermions in these geometries and show that they are light, so not decoupled from the dynamics. We then study the behaviour of Wilson loops in the 10d lifts of these geometries. We find a transition from AdS-like strings in the UV to strings that interact with the unknown physics of the central singularity of the space in the IR.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Coherence Effects in Charmonium Production off Nuclei : Consequences for J/\psi Suppression,"On ""the authentic damping mechanism"" of the phonon damping model",True,"The probabilistic Glauber formula for nuclear absorption used in the literature is only valid at low energies and $x_+ \simeq 0$. Due to energy conservation, $\sigma_{abs}$ is replaced by an effective cross-section $\sigma_{abs} + x_+^{\gamma}$ ($\sigma_{c\bar{c}-N} - \sigma_{abs})$ which increases with $x_+$ and tends to the total $c\bar{c}-N$ cross-section $\sigma_{c\bar{c}-N}$. Experimental data can be described with $\sigma_{abs} \sim 4 \div 5$mb and $\sigma_{c\bar{c}-N} \sim 15 \div 20$mb. At high energies, due to the increase of the coherence length, this formula changes. The main change is the replacement of $\sigma_{abs}$ by $\sigma_{c\bar{c}-N}$ -- for all values of $x_+$, as $s \to \infty$. Thus, if $\sigma_{c\bar{c}-N} > \sigma_{abs}$ the $J/\psi$ suppression due to nuclear interaction will increase with energy.",Some general features of the phonon damping model are presented.

On the properties of level spacings for decomposable systems,Correlation-Hole Method for Spectra of Superconducting Microwave Billiards,True,"In this paper we show that the quantum theory of chaos, based on the statistical theory of energy spectra, presents inconsistencies difficult to overcome. In classical mechanics a system described by an hamiltonian $H = H_1 + H_2$ (decomposable) cannot be ergodic, because there are always two dependent integrals of motion besides the constant of energy. In quantum mechanics we prove the existence of decomposable systems \linebreak $H^q = H^q_1 + H^q_2$ whose spacing distribution agrees with the Wigner law and we show that in general the spacing distribution of $H^q$ is not the Poisson law, even if it has often the same qualitative behaviour. We have found that the spacings of $H^q$ are among the solutions of a well defined class of homogeneous linear systems. We have obtained an explicit formula for the bases of the kernels of these systems, and a chain of inequalities which the coefficients of a generic linear combination of the basis vectors must satisfy so that the elements of a particular solution will be all positive, i.e. can be considered a set of spacings.","The spectral fluctuation properties of various two- and three-dimensional superconducting billiard systems are investigated by employing the correlation-hole method. It rests on the sensitivity of the spectral Fourier transform to long range correlations and is thus an alternative technique to study chaotic dynamics. First, we apply the method to the eigenfrequencies which are extracted from the measured resonances. Second, we analyze the unfolded raw spectra, including the shape of the resonances. The merit of the method lies in a clear separation of the statistics due to the positions and due to the shape of the resonances. However, we show that statistical fluctuations of the intensities of the resonances have a strong impact on the observable. Therefore, the visibility of the correlation hole is studied as a function of the number of independent statistical variables entering into the intensities. The visibility improves if independent spectra are superimposed.",Chaotic Dynamics,"Chaotic dynamics in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of chaotic systems and dynamical systems that exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions, leading to behavior that appears to be random or unpredictable even though the systems are deterministic in nature. in paticular, this includes dynamical systems, chaos, quantum chaos, topological dynamics, cycle expansions, turbulence, and propagation."
Theoretical priors in scalar-tensor cosmologies: Thawing quintessence,Hot WHIM counterparts of FUV OVI absorbers: Evidence in the line-of-sight towards quasar 3C 273,True,"The late time acceleration of the Universe can be characterized in terms of an extra, time dependent, component of the universe -- dark energy. The simplest proposal for dark energy is a scalar-tensor theory -- quintessence -- which consists of a scalar field, $\phi$, whose dynamics is solely dictated by its potential, $V(\phi)$. Such a theory can be uniquely characterized by the equation of state of the scalar field energy momentum-tensor. We find the time dependence of the equation of state for a broad family of potentials and, using this information, we propose an analytic prior distribution for the most commonly used parametrization. We show that this analytic prior can be used to accurately predict the distribution of observables for the next generation of cosmological surveys. Including the theoretical priors in the comparison with observations considerably improves the constraints on the equation of state.","We explore the high spectral resolution X-ray data towards the quasar 3C273 to search for signals of hot ($\sim10^{6-7}$ K) X-ray-absorbing gas co-located with two established intergalactic FUV OVI absorbers. We analyze the soft X-ray band grating data of all XMM-Newton and Chandra instruments to search for the hot phase absorption lines at the FUV predicted redshifts. The viability of potential line detections is examined by adopting the constraints of a physically justified absorption model. The WHIM hypothesis is investigated with a complementary 3D galaxy distribution analysis, and by comparison of the measurement results to the WHIM properties in the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation. At FUV redshift z=0.09017, we measured signals of two hot ion species, OVIII and NeIX, with a $3.9\sigma$ combined significance level. Considering the line features in all instruments collectively and assuming collisional equilibrium for absorbing gas, we were able to constrain the temperature ($kT=0.26\pm0.03$ keV) and the column density ($N_H\times{Z_\odot/Z}=1.3_{-0.5}^{+0.6}\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$) of the absorber. Thermal analysis indicates that FUV and X-ray absorption relate to different phases, with estimated temperatures $T_{FUV}\approx3\times10^5$ and $T_{X-ray}\approx3\times10^6$ K, which match the EAGLE predictions for WHIM at the FUV/X-ray measured $N_{ion}$-ranges. We detected a large scale galactic filament crossing the sightline at the redshift of the absorption, linking the absorption to this structure. This study provides insights into co-existing warm and hot gas within a WHIM filament and estimates the ratio of the hot and warm phases. Because the hot phase is thermally distinct from the OVI gas, the estimated baryon content of the absorber is increased, conveying the promise of X-ray follow-up studies of FUV detected WHIM in refining the picture of the missing baryons.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Ultralight Particle Dark Matter,Flavor Changing Neutral Higgs Couplings and Top-Charm Production at Next Linear Collider,True,"We review the physics case for very weakly coupled ultralight particles beyond the Standard Model, in particular for axions and axion-like particles (ALPs): (i) the axionic solution of the strong CP problem and its embedding in well motivated extensions of the Standard Model; (ii) the possibility that the cold dark matter in the Universe is comprised of axions and ALPs; (iii) the ALP explanation of the anomalous transparency of the Universe for TeV photons; and (iv) the axion or ALP explanation of the anomalous energy loss of white dwarfs.

In the framework of a general two-Higgs doublet model, we perform a complete calculation and find that $\sigma (e^+e^-\to \nu_e\nu_e t\bar{c}, \nu_e\bar{\nu_e} {\bar t}c)$ could reach $\sim 9$ fb for $\sqrt{s}=2 TeV$. This amounts to an annual production of 500 $t\bar{c}$ plus $\bar{t}c$ pairs at the NLC with an integrated luminosity of 50 fb$^{-1}$. The dependence of $tc$-production rate on the neutral scalar mixing angle is mild except when $\sin^2\alpha \to 0 or 1$.

"Vacuum Fluctuations, Geometric Modular Action and Relativistic Quantum Information Theory",Electron-positron energy deposition rate from neutrino pair annihilation on the rotation axis of neutron and quark stars,True,"A summary of some lines of ideas leading to model-independent frameworks of relativistic quantum field theory is given. It is followed by a discussion of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem and geometric modular action of Tomita-Takesaki modular objects associated with the quantum field vacuum state and certain algebras of observables. The distillability concept, which is significant in specifying useful entanglement in quantum information theory, is discussed within the setting of general relativistic quantum field theory.","We investigate the deposition of energy due to the annihilations of neutrinos and antineutrinos on the rotation axis of rotating neutron and quark stars, respectively. The source of the neutrinos is assumed to be a neutrino-cooled accretion disk around the compact object. Under the assumption of the separability of the neutrino null geodesic equation of motion we obtain the general relativistic expression of the energy deposition rate for arbitrary stationary and axisymmetric space-times. The neutrino trajectories are obtained by using a ray tracing algorithm, based on numerically solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for neutrinos by reversing the proper time evolution. We obtain the energy deposition rates for several classes of rotating neutron stars, described by different equations of state of the neutron matter, and for quark stars, described by the MIT bag model equation of state and in the CFL (Color-Flavor-Locked) phase, respectively. The electron-positron energy deposition rate on the rotation axis of rotating neutron and quark stars is studied for two accretion disk models (isothermal disk and accretion disk in thermodynamical equilibrium). Rotation and general relativistic effects modify the total annihilation rate of the neutrino-antineutrino pairs on the rotation axis of compact stellar, as measured by an observer at infinity. The differences in the equations of state for neutron and quark matter also have important effects on the spatial distribution of the energy deposition rate by neutrino-antineutrino annihilation.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Spin Mode-Switching at the Edge of a Quantum Hall System,Vibronic interaction in crystals with the Jahn-Teller centers in the elementary energy bands concept,True,"Quantum Hall states can be characterized by their chiral edge modes. Upon softening the edge potential, the edge has long been known to undergo spontaneous reconstruction driven by charging effects. In this paper we demonstrate a qualitatively distinct phenomenon driven by exchange effects, in which the ordering of the edge modes at $\nu=3$ switches abruptly as the edge potential is made softer, while the ordering in the bulk remains intact. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is robust, and has many verifiable experimental signatures in transport.","The order-disorder type phase transition caused by the vibronic interaction (collective Jahn-Teller effect) in a monoclinic CuInP$_2$S$_6$ crystal is analyzed. For this purpose, a trigonal protostructure model of CuInP$_2$S$_6$ is created, through a slight change in the crystal lattice parameters of the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ paraelectric phase. In parallel to the group-theoretical analysis, the DFT-based {\it ab initio} band structure calculations of the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ protostructure, para-, and ferriphases are performed. Using the elementary energy bands concept, a part of the band structure from the vicinity of the forbidden energy gap, which is created by the $d$-electron states of copper, has been related with a certain Wyckoff position where the Jahn-Teller's centers are localized. A construction procedure of the vibronic potential energy matrix is generalized for the case of crystal using the elementary energy bands concept and the group theoretical method of invariants. The procedure is illustrated by the creation of the adiabatic potentials of the $\Gamma_5$-$\Gamma_5$ vibronic coupling for the protostructure and paraphase of the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ crystal.

Secular Orbital Dynamics of the Possibly Habitable Planet K2-18 b with and without the Proposed Inner Companion,Mid-Infrared Polarization of Herbig Ae/Be Discs,True,"The transiting planet K2-18 b is one of the best candidates for a relatively nearby world harboring biological life. The long-term orbital evolution of this planet is investigated using theoretical and purely numerical techniques for two possible configurations: a single planet orbiting the host star, and a two-planet system including the proposed inner planet close to the 4:1 mean motion rationalization. The emphasis is made on the secular changes of eccentricity and orbital inclination, which are important for the climate stability of the planet. It is demonstrated that the secular orbital dynamics of planet K2-18 b with an internal companion are accurately represented by the periodic eccentricity and inclination exchange on the time scales of a few Kyr. A single planet is not expected to experience fast orbital changes, with the much weaker tidal and rotation-driven perturbations mostly reflecting in a slow periastron and nodal precession. The tidal decay of the orbit is too insignificant on the time scale of the stellar age. However, the conditions for the habitability of a single K2-18 b planet are much improved if, like the Earth, it rotates faster than the mean motion and its rotation angle is tilted by a hypothetical moon. Milankovi{\'c}'s cycles of the habitable planet's climate are discussed for both configurations.","We measured mid-infrared polarization of protoplanetary discs to gain new insight into their magnetic fields. Using CanariCam at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias, we detected linear polarization at 8.7, 10.3, and 12.5 $\mu$m from discs around eight Herbig Ae/Be stars and one T-Tauri star. We analyzed polarimetric properties of each object to find out the most likely interpretation of the data. While the observed mid-infrared polarization from most objects is consistent with polarized emission and/or absorption arising from aligned dust particles, we cannot rule out polarization due to dust scattering for a few objects in our sample. For those objects for which polarization can be explained by polarized emission and/or absorption, we examined how the derived magnetic field structure correlates with the disc position angle and inclination. We found no preference for a certain type of magnetic field. Instead, various configurations (toroidal, poloidal, or complex) are inferred from the observations.

Finite volume treatment of $\pi\pi$ scattering in the $\rho$ channel,Quark propagator with two flavors of O(a)-improved Wilson fermions,True,"We make a theoretical study of $\pi\pi$ scattering with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ in a finite box. To calculate physical observables for infinite volume from lattice QCD, the finite box dependence of the potentials is not usually considered. We quantify such effects by means of two different approaches for vector-isovector $\pi\pi$ scattering based on Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory results: the Inverse Amplitude Method and another one based on the $N/D$ method. We take into account finite box effects stemming from higher orders through loops in the crossed $t,u-$channels as well as from the renormalization of the coupling constants. The main conclusion is that for $\pi\pi$ phase shifts in the isovector channel one can safely apply L\""uscher based methods for finite box sizes of $L$ greater than $2 m_\pi^{-1}$.","We compute the Landau gauge quark propagator from lattice QCD with two flavors of dynamical O(a)-improved Wilson fermions. The calculation is carried out with lattice spacings ranging from 0.06 fm to 0.08 fm, with quark masses corresponding to pion masses of 420, 290 and 150 MeV, and for volumes of up to (4.5fm)^4. Our ensembles allow us to evaluate lattice spacing, volume and quark mass effects. We find that the quark wave function which is suppressed in the infrared, is further suppressed as the quark mass is reduced, but the suppression is weakened as the volume is increased. The quark mass function M(p^2) shows only a weak volume dependence. Hypercubic artefacts beyond O(a) are reduced by applying both cylinder cuts and H4 extrapolations. The H4 extrapolation shifts the quark wave function systematically upwards but does not perform well for the mass function.",High Energy Physics - Lattice,"High energy physics - lattice focuses on lattice field theory as a method to investigate the properties of quantum fields and strongly interacting systems, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons.

Heavy-Quark spin symmetry breaking in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation,Transplanckian Censorship and Global Cosmic Strings,True,"Heavy-quark spin symmetry is explicitly broken by the mass splitting between a heavy-light pseudoscalar meson and its vector partner. This fact plays a pivotal role in the physics of states whose mass lies close to the threshold of an open-flavor meson pair, like $X(3872)$. We show that this source of heavy-quark spin symmetry breaking can be systematically included within the diabatic representation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We verify that including all the appropriate coupled channels guarantees conservation of total angular momentum, parity, and charge-conjugation parity. This marks a fundamental step towards a unified, first-principles study of quarkonia and meson molecules with hidden flavor.","Large field excursions are required in a number of axion models of inflation. These models also possess global cosmic strings, around which the axion follows a path mirroring the inflationary trajectory. Cosmic strings are thus an interesting theoretical laboratory for the study of transplanckian field excursions. We describe connections between various effective field theory models of axion monodromy and study the classical spacetimes around their supercritical cosmic strings. For small decay constants $f<M_p$ and large winding numbers $n>M_p/f$, the EFT is under control and the string cores undergo topological inflation, which may be either of exponential or power-law type. We show that the exterior spacetime is nonsingular and equivalent to a decompactifying cigar geometry, with the radion rolling in a potential generated by axion flux. Signals are able to circumnavigate infinite straight strings in finite but exponentially long time, $t\sim e^{\Delta a/M_p}$.

The model is a neural network that is jointly trained to respect governing physical laws and match boundary conditions. The methodology is hereby used to simulate a 2-phase immiscible transport problem (Buckley-Leverett). The model is able to produce an accurate physical solution both in terms of shock and rarefaction and honors the governing partial differential equation along with initial and boundary conditions. We test various hypothesis (uniform and non-uniform initial conditions) and show that with the proper implementation of physical constraints, a robust solution can be trained within a reasonable amount of time and iterations. We revisit some of the limitations presented in previous work \cite{Fuks2020} and further the applicability of this method in a forward, pure hyperbolic setup. We also share some practical findings on the application of physics informed neural networks (PINN). We review various network architectures presented in the literature and show tips that helped improve their convergence and accuracy. The proposed methodology is a simple and elegant way to instill physical knowledge to machine-learning algorithms. This alleviates the two most significant shortcomings of machine-learning algorithms: the requirement for large datasets and the reliability of extrapolation. The principles presented can be generalized in innumerable ways in the future and should lead to a new class of algorithms to solve both forward and inverse physical problems.","The Leidenfrost effect-prolonged evaporation of droplets on a superheated surface-happens only when the surface temperature is above a certain transitional value. Here, we show that specially engineered droplets - liquid marbles - can exhibit similar effect at any superheated temperatures (up to 465 oC tested in our experiment) without a transition.

Anomalous Dynamics and Equilibration in the Classical Heisenberg Chain,Electric Ferro-Axial Moment as Nanometric Rotator and Source of Longitudinal Spin Current,True,"The search for departures from standard hydrodynamics in many-body systems has yielded a number of promising leads, especially in low dimension. Here we study one of the simplest classical interacting lattice models, the nearest-neighbour Heisenberg chain, with temperature as tuning parameter. Our numerics expose strikingly different spin dynamics between the antiferromagnet, where it is largely diffusive, and the ferromagnet, where we observe strong evidence either of spin super-diffusion or an extremely slow crossover to diffusion. This difference also governs the equilibration after a quench, and, remarkably, is apparent even at very high temperatures.","An electric ferro-axial moment, which is characterized by a nonzero expectation value of a time-reversal-even axial vector, exhibits distinct spatial-inversion and time-reversal properties from conventional ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, and ferro-magnetoelectric orders. Nevertheless, physical properties characteristic of the electric ferro-axial moment have been obscure owing to the absence of its conjugate electromagnetic fields. We theoretically investigate consequences of the presence of the ferro-axial moment on the basis of the symmetry and microscopic model analyses. We show that atomic-scale electric toroidal multipoles are the heart of the ferro-axial moment, which act as a nanometric rotator against external stimuli. Furthermore, we propose an intrinsic generation of a spin current parallel to an applied electric field in both metals and insulators. Our results not only provide a deep microscopic understanding of the role of the ferro-axial moment but also stimulate a new development for functional materials with use of the electric toroidal moment.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

The model gives a very good description of the data on the gamma-gamma total cross-section, on the photon structure function F_2^gamma(x,Q^2) at low x and on the gamma*-gamma* cross-section.","The interplay of pQCD, pion exchange and FSI effects is studied for the gamma gamma --> pi^+ pi^- reaction in the region of 2 GeV < W_{gamma gamma} < 6 GeV. We find strong interference effects between pQCD and soft pion-exchange amplitudes up to W_{gamma gamma} ~ 4 GeV. We discuss to which extend the conventional hadronic FSI effects could cloud the pQCD effects. We study multipole soft and hard scattering effects as well as the coupling between final state hadronic channels. We show how the perturbative effects in gamma gamma --> rho rho may mix with perturbative effects in gamma gamma --> pi^+ pi^-. The effects discussed in this paper improve the agreement with the new data of the DELPHI and ALEPH collaborations. We give estimates of the onset of the pQCD regime.

"On the BLM scale-fixing procedure, its generalizations and ""genuine"" higher order corrections",Cosmological evolution of interacting dark energy in Lorentz violation,True,The question of the uniqueness of the Brodsky--Lepage--Mackenzie procedure for fixing the renormalization scale in perturbative QCD is discussed. It is shown that the resulting finite order approximants are as ambiguous as the original truncated perturbative expansions. This inherent ambiguity of the BLM procedure undermines the recent attempts to define ``genuine'' higher order perturbative corrections.,"The cosmological evolution of an interacting scalar field model in which the scalar field interacts with dark matter, radiation, and baryon via Lorentz violation is investigated. We propose a model of interaction through the effective coupling $\bar{\beta}$. Using dynamical system analysis, we study the linear dynamics of an interacting model and show that the dynamics of critical points are completely controlled by two parameters. Some results can be mentioned as follows. Firstly, the sequence of radiation, the dark matter, and the scalar field dark energy exist and baryons are sub dominant. Secondly, the model also allows the possibility of having a universe in the phantom phase with constant potential. Thirdly, the effective gravitational constant varies with respect to time through $\bar{\beta}$. In particular, we consider a simple case where $\bar{\beta}$ has a quadratic form and has a good agreement with the modified $\Lambda$CDM and quintessence models. Finally, we also calculate the first post--Newtonian parameters for our model.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

The phase-locked mean impulse response of a turbulent channel flow,Non-Fickian macroscopic model of axial diffusion of granular materials in a long cylindrical tumbler,True,"We describe the first DNS-based measurement of the complete mean response of a turbulent channel flow to small external disturbances. Space-time impulsive perturbations are applied at one channel wall, and the linear response describes their mean effect on the flow field as a function of spatial and temporal separations. The turbulent response is shown to differ from the response a laminar flow with the turbulent mean velocity profile as base flow.","We provide new concepts for understanding transport phenomena in flows of granular materials by using a non-Fickian macroscopic model of axial diffusion of a granular material in a finite cylindrical tumbler. The model accounts for diffusion induced by particle collisions only in a thin surface flowing layer due to localization of shear within the cross-section of the drum. All model parameters are related to measurable quantities in a granular flow. It is shown that the proposed model is a member of the general class of linear constitutive relations with memory. An exact solution for the spreading of a finite-width pulse initial condition under the proposed non-Fickian model is derived and compared to the solution of a Fickian model (i.e., the ``classical'' diffusion equation).",Fluid Dynamics,"Fluid dynamics in physics focuses on turbulence, instabilities, incompressible/compressible flows, reacting flows.

Hyperuniformity and its Generalizations,Writhe-induced knotting in a lattice polymer,True,"Disordered many-particle hyperuniform systems are exotic amorphous states characterized by anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations. Here we substantially broaden the hyperuniformity concept along four different directions. This includes generalizations to treat fluctuations in the interfacial area in heterogeneous media and surface-area driven evolving microstructures, random scalar fields, divergence-free random vector fields, as well as statistically anisotropic many-particle systems and two-phase media. Interfacial-area fluctuations play a major role in characterizing the microstructure of two-phase systems , physical properties that intimately depend on the geometry of the interface, and evolving two-phase microstructures that depend on interfacial energies (e.g., spinodal decomposition). In the instances of divergence-free random vector fields and statistically anisotropic structures, we show that the standard definition of hyperuniformity must be generalized such that it accounts for the dependence of the relevant spectral functions on the direction in which the origin in Fourier space (nonanalyticities at the origin). Using this analysis, we place some well-known energy spectra from the theory of isotropic turbulence in the context of this generalization of hyperuniformity. We show that there exist many-particle ground-state configurations in which directional hyperuniformity imparts exotic anisotropic physical properties (e.g., elastic, optical and acoustic characteristics) to these states of matter. Such tunablity could have technological relevance for manipulating light and sound waves in ways heretofore not thought possible. We show that disordered many-particle systems that respond to external fields (e.g., magnetic and electric fields) are a natural class of materials to look for directional hyperuniformity.","We consider a simple lattice model of a topological phase transition in open polymers. To be precise, we study a model of self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice tethered to a surface and weighted by an appropriately defined writhe. We also consider the effect of pulling the untethered end of the polymer from the surface. Regardless of the force we find a first-order phase transition which we argue is a consequence of increased knotting in the lattice polymer, rather than due to other effects such as the formation of plectonemes.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

The singularity problem and phase-space noncanonical noncommutativity,Electroweak symmetry breaking in the inverse seesaw mechanism,True,"The Wheeler-DeWitt equation arising from a Kantowski-Sachs model is considered for a Schwarzschild black hole under the assumption that the scale factors and the associated momenta satisfy a noncanonical noncommutative extension of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. An integral of motion is used to factorize the wave function into an oscillatory part and a function of a configuration space variable. The latter is shown to be normalizable using asymptotic arguments. It is then shown that on the hypersufaces of constant value of the argument of the wave function's oscillatory piece, the probability vanishes in the vicinity of the black hole singularity.","We investigate the stability of Higgs potential in inverse seesaw models. We derive the full two-loop RGEs of the relevant parameters, such as the quartic Higgs self-coupling, taking thresholds into account. We find that for relatively large Yukawa couplings the Higgs quartic self-coupling goes negative well below the Standard Model instability scale $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. We show, however, that the ``dynamical'' inverse seesaw with spontaneous lepton number violation can lead to a completely consistent and stable Higgs vacuum up to the Planck scale.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

A classification of 3+1D bosonic topological orders (I): the case when point-like excitations are all bosons,Strong angular dependent transmission ratio due to interplay between spin waves and the domain wall in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy materials,True,"Topological orders are new phases of matter beyond Landau symmetry breaking. They correspond to patterns of long-range entanglement. In recent years, it was shown that in 1+1D bosonic systems there is no nontrivial topological order, while in 2+1D bosonic systems the topological orders are classified by a pair: a modular tensor category and a chiral central charge. In this paper, we propose a partial classification of topological orders for 3+1D bosonic systems: If all the point-like excitations are bosons, then such topological orders are classified by unitary pointed fusion 2-categories, which are one-to-one labeled by a finite group $G$ and its group 4-cocycle $\omega_4 \in \mathcal H^4[G;U(1)]$ up to group automorphisms. Furthermore, all such 3+1D topological orders can be realized by Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories.",Spin waves (SW) can induce rich domain wall (DW) motion in a perpendicular-magnetic anisotropy nanostrip. In-plane magnetization tilt angle resulting from the fluctuation of the effective field of the magnetization response in the DW region plays an essential role in the dynamics of SW interacting with a DW. We performed simulation and found that the transmission ratio of the propagating SW across the DW depends strongly on the tilt angle in the low-frequency regime.

Dielectric properties and lattice dynamics of Ca-doped K$_{0.95}$Li$_{0.05}$TaO$_{3}$,"Valence and spin states in perovskites LaCo0.95M0.05O3 (M = Mg, Ga, Ti)",True,"Relaxor behavior and lattice dynamics have been studied for a single crystal of K$_{1-x}$Li$_x$TaO$_3$ $(x=0.05)$, where a small amount of a Ca impurity ($\sim 15$~ppm) was incorporated. The dielectric measurements revealed Debye-like relaxations with Arrhenius activation energies of 80 and 240 meV that are assigned to Li$^+$ dipoles and the Li$^+$-Li$^+$ dipolar pairs, respectively. In the neutron scattering results, diffuse scattering ridges appear around the nuclear Bragg peaks below $\sim 150$ K and phonon line broadening features start to appear at even higher temperatures suggesting that polar nano-regions (PNR's) start to form at these temperatures. These results are supported by the dielectric data that reveal relaxor behavior starting at $\sim 200$ K on cooling. From analyses of the diffuse intensities, the displacements include a uniform phase shift of all of the atoms in addition to the atomic displacements corresponding to a polarization vector of the transverse optic soft ferroelectric mode, a finding that is analogous to that in the prototypical relaxor material Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$.","The samples LaCoO3 with dilute substitutions on cobalt sites have been studied using the resistivity, thermopower and magnetic susceptibility measurements over the temperature range up to ~900 K. The Co-site substitution does not affect the magnetic transition at ~100 K and the onset of massive population of hole carriers at ~500 K, characteristic for undoped LaCoO3. On the other hand, the low-temperature transport and magnetism is markedly distinct for samples with extra charge on cobalt ions introduced by the heterovalent dopants (Mg2+, Ti4+) compared to samples with minor non-stoichiometry (LaCoO3, Ga3+ doped sample).

Dynamical renormalization group approach to the Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov equations,Dark Matter and Dark Force in the Type-I Inert 2HDM with Local U(1)_H Gauge Symmetry,True,The Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov equations for the parton distribution functions are rederived using the dynamical renormalization group approach to quantum kinetics. This method systematically treats the ln Q^2 corrections that arises in perturbation theory as a renormalization of the parton distribution function and unambiguously indicates that the strong coupling must be allowed to run with the scale in the evolution kernel. To leading logarithmic accuracy the evolution equation is Markovian and the logarithmic divergences in the perturbative expansion are identified with the secular divergences (terms that grow in time) that emerge in a perturbative treatment of the kinetic equations in nonequilibrium systems. The resummation of the leading logarithms by the Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov equation is thus similar to the resummation of the leading secular terms by the Boltzmann kinetic equation.,"We discuss dark matter (DM) physics in the Type-I inert two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) with local U(1)_H Higgs gauge symmetry. The local U(1)_H gauge symmetry is assigned to the extra Higgs doublet in order to avoid the Higgs-mediated flavor problems, and it spontaneously breaks down to its discrete subgroup. The lightest neutral scalar component H of the U(1)_H-charged Higgs doublet, which does not have Yukawa couplings with the Standard-Model (SM) fermions, is stable because of the remnant discrete symmetry, and it interacts with the SM particles through the U(1)_H gauge boson (Z_H) exchange as well as the SM boson exchange. We first investigate the constraint on the U(1)_H gauge interaction, especially through the kinetic and mass mixing between the SM gauge bosons and the extra gauge boson. Then we discuss dark matter physics in our 2HDM: thermal relic density, and direct/indirect detections of dark matter. The additional U(1)_H gauge interaction plays a crucial role in reducing the DM thermal relic density. The most important result within the inert DM model with local U(1)_H symmetry is that ~ O(10) GeV dark matter scenario, which is strongly disfavored in the usual Inert Doublet Model (IDM) with Z_2 symmetry, is revived in our model because of newly open channels, H H -> Z_H Z_H , Z_H Z.

"Nuclear shadowing in polarized DIS on ^6LiD at small x and its effect on the extraction of the deuteron spin structure function g_{1}^{d}(x,Q^2)",Enhanced Next-to-Leading-Order Corrections to Weak Annihilation $B$-Meson Decays,True,"We consider the effect of nuclear shadowing in polarized deep inelastic scattering (DIS) on ^6LiD at small Bjorken x and its relevance to the extraction of the deuteron spin structure function g_{1}^{d}(x,Q^2). Using models, which describe nuclear shadowing in unpolarized DIS, we demonstrate that the nuclear shadowing correction to g_{1}^{d}(x,Q^2) is significant.","We accomplish the analytical computation of the pure weak annihilation non-leptonic $B$-meson decay amplitudes at leading power in the heavy quark expansion. The novel observation regarding such fundamental hadronic quantities is that adding the missing hard-collinear contribution on top of the hard gluon exchange effect eliminates rapidity divergences entering the convolution integrals of factorization formulae. Subsequently we identify the perturbative enhancement mechanism due to the penguin contractions of the current-current operators from the weak effective Hamiltonian, which yields the significant impacts on the CP violating observables.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Lifetimes of Confined Optical Phonons and the Shape of a Raman Peak in Disordered Nanoparticles: I. Analytical Treatment,A note contrasting two microscopic theories of the fractional quantum Hall effect,True,"Microscopic description of Raman spectra in nanopowders of nonpolar crystals is accomplished by developing the theory of disorder-induced broadening of optical vibrational eigenmodes. Analytical treatment of this problem is performed, and line shape and width are determined as functions of phonon quantum numbers, nanoparticle shape, size, and the strength of disorder. The results are found to be strongly dependent on either the broadened line is separated or it is overlapped with other lines of the spectrum. Three models of disorder, i.e. weak point-like impurities, weak smooth random potential and strong rare impurities are investigated in details. The possibility to form the phonon-impurity bound state is also studied.","Two microscopic theories have been proposed for the explanation of the fractional quantum Hall effect, namely the Haldane-Halperin hierarchy theory and the composite fermion theory. Contradictory statements have been made regarding the relation between them, ranging from their being distinct to their being completely equivalent. This article attempts to provide a clarification of the issue. It is shown that the two theories postulate distinct microscopic mechanisms for the origin of the fractional quantum Hall effect, and make substantially different predictions that have allowed experiments to distinguish between them.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Correlation functions with Karsten-Wilczek fermions,0+ and 1+ heavy-light exotic mesons at N2LO in the chiral limit,True,"The Karsten-Wilczek action describes two chiral fermions but breaks the symmetries under both charge conjugation ($ \widehat{C}) $ and time reflection ($ \widehat{\Theta} $) explicitly, though invariance under $ \widehat{C\Theta} $ and a mirror fermion symmetry $ \widehat{T\Theta} $ are maintained. These proceedings outline how the action's symmetries and the presence of the second fermion emerge in mesonic correlation functions. The residual symmetries explain the non-observation of broken time-reflection symmetry in a class of mesonic correlation functions. Time-reflection symmetry is enforced for correlation functions that are manifestly invariant under $ \widehat{C} $ or $ \widehat{T} $. Due to contributions from the second fermion, oscillating contributions arise in some mesonic correlation functions. A second condition for non-perturbative tuning of the relevant counterterm is obtained from these oscillations. Both non-perturbative tuning conditions are independent and agree within errors. Due to contributions from the second fermion, additional pseudoscalar states are observed in non-standard channels. Mass splittings between these additional states and the Goldstone boson vanish as $ \mathcal{O}(a^2) $.","We use QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR) and the factorization properties of molecule and four-quark currents to estimate the masses and couplings of the 0+ and 1+ molecules and four-quark at N2LO of PT QCD.

NMSSM with Gravitino Dark Matter to be tested at LHC,Stellar population and the origin of intra-cluster stars around brightest cluster galaxies: the case of NGC 3311,True,"We present a solution to the gravitino problem, which arises in the NMSSM, allowing for sparticle spectra from ordinary gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking with weak-scale gravitino dark matter. The coupling, which links the singlet to the MSSM sector, enhances the tree-level Higgs mass, providing an attractive explanation why the observed Higgs boson is so heavy. The same coupling induces very efficient pair-annihilation processes of the neutralino NLSP. Its relic abundance can be sufficiently suppressed to satisfy the strong constraints on late decaying relics from primordial nucleosynthesis -- even for very long neutralino lifetimes. The striking prediction of this scenario is the detection of a pseudoscalar Higgs boson in the search for top-top resonances at LHC-14, rendering it completely testable.","Context. We investigate the stellar population and the origin of diffuse light around brightest cluster galaxies. Aims. We study the stellar population of the dynamically hot stellar halo of NGC 3311, the brightest galaxy in the Hydra I cluster, and that of photometric substructures in the diffuse light to constrain the origin of these components. Methods. We analyze absorption lines in medium-resolution, long-slit spectra in the wavelength range 4800-5800 angstrom obtained with FORS2 at the Very Large Telescope. We measure the equivalent width of Lick indices out to 20 kpc from the center of NGC 3311 and fit them with stellar population models that account for the [alpha/Fe] overabundance. Results. Stars in the dynamically hot halo of NGC 3311 are old (age > 13 Gyr), metal-poor ([Z/H] ~ -0.35), and alpha-enhanced ([alpha/Fe] ~ 0.48). Together with the high velocity dispersion, these measurements indicate that the stars in the halo were accreted from the outskirts of other early-type galaxies, with a possible contribution from dwarf galaxies. We identify a region in the halo of NGC 3311 associated with a photometric substructure where the stellar population is even more metal-poor ([Z/H] ~ -0.73). In this region, our measurements are consistent with a composite stellar population superposed along the line of sight, consisting of stars from the dynamically hot halo of NGC 3311 and stars stripped from dwarf galaxies. The latter component contributes < 28% to the local surface brightness. Conclusions. The build-up of diffuse light around NGC 3311 is on-going.

The correspondence between long-range and short-range spin glasses,Flux fluctuations in a multi-random-walker model and surface growth dynamics,True,"We compare the critical behavior of the short-range Ising spin glass with a spin glass with long-range interactions which fall off as a power sigma of the distance. We show that there is a value of sigma of the long-range model for which the critical behavior is very similar to that of the short-range model in four dimensions. We also study a value of sigma for which we find the critical behavior to be compatible with that of the three dimensional model, though we have much less precision than in the four-dimensional case.","We study the dynamics of visitation flux in a multi-random-walker model by comparison to surface growth dynamics in which one random walker drops a particle to a node at each time the walker visits the node. In each independent experiment (trial or day) for the multi-random-walker model, the number of walkers are randomly chosen from the uniform distribution $[< N_{RW} > -\triangle N_{RW}, < N_{RW} > +\triangle N_{RW} ]$. The averaged fluctuation $\bar {\sigma} ({T_{RW}})$ of the visitations over all nodes $i$ and independent experiments is shown to satisfy the power-law dependence on the walk step $T_{RW}$ as $\bar {\sigma} ({T_{RW}})\simeq {T_{RW}}^\beta$. Furthermore two distinct values of the exponent $\beta$ are found on a scale-free network, a random network and regular lattices. One is $\beta_i$, which is equal to the growth exponent $\beta$ for the surface fluctuation $W$ in one-random-walker model, and the other is $\beta=1$. $\beta_i$ is found for small $\triangle N_{RW}$ or for the system governed by the internal intrinsic dynamics. In contrast $\beta=1$ is found for large $\triangle N_{RW}$ or for the system governed by the external flux variations.

Inelastic neutrino scattering off hot nuclei in supernova environments,Pion masses in quasiconformal gauge field theories,True,"We study inelastic neutrino scattering off hot nuclei for temperatures relevant under supernova conditions. The method we use is based on the quasiparticle random phase approximation extended to finite temperatures within the thermo field dynamics (TQRPA). The method allows a transparent treatment of upward and downward transitions in hot nuclei, avoiding the application of Brink's hypothesis. For the sample nuclei $^{56}$Fe and $^{82}$Ge we perform a detailed analysis of thermal effects on the strength distributions of allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions which dominate the scattering process at low neutrino energies. For $^{56}$Fe and $^{82}$Ge the finite temperature cross-sections are calculated by taking into account the contribution of allowed and forbidden transitions. The observed enhancement of the cross-section at low neutrino energies is explained by considering thermal effects on the GT strength. For $^{56}$Fe we compare the calculated cross-sections to those obtained earlier from a hybrid approach that combines large-scale shell-model and RPA calculations.","We study modifications to Weinberg-like sum rules in quasiconformal gauge field theories.

The simultaneous reproduction of its small binding energy and extended matter and point-proton radii has been a challenge for {\em ab initio} theoretical calculations based on traditional bound-state methods. Using soft nucleon-nucleon interactions based on chiral effective field theory potentials, we show that supplementing the model space with $^4$He+$n$+$n$ cluster degrees of freedom largely solves this issue. We analyze the role played by the $\alpha$-clustering and many-body correlations, and study the dependence of the energy spectrum on the resolution scale of the interaction.","The transverse momentum dependent nuclear modification factors (NMF), namely $R_{CP}$, is investigated for protons produced in Au + Au at 1$A$ GeV within the framework of the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model. It is found that the radial collective motion during the expansion stage affects the NMF at low transverse momentum a lot. By fitting the transverse mass spectra of protons with the distribution function from the Blast-Wave model, the magnitude of radial flow can be extracted. After removing the contribution from radial flow, the $R_{CP}$ can be regarded as a thermal one and is found to keep unitary at transverse momentum lower than 0.6 GeV/c and enhance at higher transverse momentum, which can be attributed to Cronin effect.",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

Heat conduction in a three-dimensional momentum-conserving fluid,Structural and Dynamical Fingerprints of the Anomalous Dielectric Properties of Water Under Confinement,True,"Size-dependence of energy transport and the effects of reduced dimensionality on transport coefficients are of key importance for understanding nonequilibrium properties of matter on the nanoscale. Here, we perform nonequilibrium and equilibrium simulations of heat conduction in a 3D fluid with the multiparticle collision dynamics, interacting with two thermal-walls. We find that the bulk 3D momentum-conserving fluid has a finite non-diverging thermal conductivity. However, for large aspect-ratios of the simulation box, a crossover from 3D to one-dimensional (1D) abnormal behavior of the thermal conductivity occurs. In this case, we demonstrate a transition from normal to abnormal transport by a suitable decomposition of the energy current. These results not only provide a direct verification of Fourier's law but also further confirm the validity of existing theories for 3D fluids. Moreover, they indicate that abnormal heat transport persists also for almost 1D fluids over a large range of sizes.","There is a long-standing question about the molecular configuration of interfacial water molecules in the proximity of solid surfaces, particularly carbon atoms which play a crucial role in electrochemistry and biology. In this study, the dielectric, structural and dynamical properties of confined water placed between two parallel graphene walls at different inter distances from the Angstrom scale to few tens of nanometer have been investigated using molecular dynamics. For dielectric properties of water, we show that the perpendicular component of water dielectric constant drastically decreases under sub $2\; nm$ spatial confinement. The achieved dielectric constant data through linear response and fluctuation-dissipation theory, are consistent with recent reported experimental results. By determining the charge density as well as fluctuations in the number of atoms, we provide a molecular rationale for the behavior of perpendicular dielectric response function. We also interpret the behavior of the dielectric response in terms of the presence of dangling O-H bonds of waters. By examining the residence time and lateral diffusion constant of water under confinement, we reveal that the water molecules tend to keep their hydrogen bond networks at the interface of water-graphene. We also found consistency between lateral diffusion and z-component of variance in the center of mass of the system as a function of confinement.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

The experiments are challenging, since A_{LR} is small, typically between 10^(-4) and 10^(-8). By carefully choosing appropriate targets and kinematics, various pieces of the weak Lagrangian can be isolated, providing a search for physics beyond the Standard Model.

The combined action of the waves induced by the migrating planet and drag back-reaction on the gas produces a complex evolution of the flux of pebbles. The waves excite zonal flows which act as dust traps, and accumulate pebbles. Owing to drag back-reaction, a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops, generating turbulent dust rings containing several Earth masses of solids, where planetesimal formation is likely. The more massive the planet, the faster the dust rings develop. In competition with planet migration, this process triggers several dust rings, with a radial separation scaling as $1/M_p$. We discover a transition around $13$ Earth masses. Below that, pebbles are stopped at the inner side of the planet's orbit, but pebble accretion on the planet is sustained. Above that, drag back-reaction in the dust ring region flattens the pressure profile while the planet migrates, which limits further growth by pebble accretion. This new {\it pebble isolation mass} is about a factor of 2 lower than often reported in the literature. This reduces the overall formation timescale of Super-Earth planets, while favoring their survival after the disk's dissipation because further accretion is stifled. Finally, our results support an hybrid model for the formation of Jupiter via both pebbles and planetesimals accretion.","We present calculations of the auroral radio powers expected from exoplanets with magnetospheres driven by an Earth-like magnetospheric interaction with the solar wind. Specifically, we compute the twin cell-vortical ionospheric flows, currents, and resulting radio powers resulting from a Dungey cycle process driven by dayside and nightside magnetic reconnection, as a function of planetary orbital distance and magnetic field strength. We include saturation of the magnetospheric convection, as observed at the terrestrial magnetosphere, and we present power law approximations for the convection potentials, radio powers and spectral flux densities. We specifically consider a solar-age system and a young (1 Gyr) system. We show that the radio power increases with magnetic field strength for magnetospheres with saturated convection potential, and broadly decreases with increasing orbital distance. We show that the magnetospheric convection at hot Jupiters will be saturated, and thus unable to dissipate the full available incident Poynting flux, such that the magnetic Radiometric Bode's Law (RBL) presents a substantial overestimation of the radio powers for hot Jupiters. Our radio powers for hot Jupiters are $\sim$5-1300 TW for hot Jupiters with field strengths of 0.1-10 $B_J$ orbiting a Sun-like star, while we find that competing effects yield essentially identical powers for hot Jupiters orbiting a young Sun-like star. However, in particular for planets with weaker magnetic fields our powers are higher at larger orbital distances than given by the RBL, and there are many configurations of planet that are expected to be detectable using SKA.",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"Earth and planetary astrophysics focuses on interplanetary medium, planetary physics, planetary astrobiology, extrasolar planets, comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

Penguin corrections and strong phases in a time-dependent analysis of $B^0_{d} \to \pi^+ \pi^-$,Distinguishing cusp effects and near-threshold-pole effects,True,"From a time-dependent analysis of the decay $B^0_{d} \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ and using a model-dependent $A_P/A_T$ ratio of the penguin-to-tree amplitudes contributing to the decay, both the weak phase $\alpha$ and the strong phase shift difference $\delta$ can be extracted from the data. The value of the weak phase $\beta$, expected to be measured from the decay $B^0_{d} \to J/\psi K_S$, is used to parameterize the value of $A_P/A_T$ and the corresponding penguin correction to the observed asymmetry in $B^0_{d} \to \pi^+ \pi^-$.","We make use of a unitarized coupled-channel model to analyze the mass distribution data of final states in production processes of $X(4260)$. By analyzing the analytical structures of the decay amplitudes, we find that the line shape of $Z_c(3900)$ signal is related to the combined effect of a pair of near-threshold ""shadow"" poles and the $(D\bar{D}^*)^\pm$ thresholds, in which the third-sheet pole might provide a dominant contribution. As all the coupled channels effects are tuning off, the trajectories of these two poles suggest that the $Z_c(3900)$ might originate from the attractive interaction of $(D^*\bar{D}^*)^\pm$ through a long-distance interaction, $e.g.$ $\pi$-exchange interaction, as a ""deuteron-like"" state.

Superconductivity at 5 K in quasi-one-dimensional Cr-based KCr3As3 single crystals,Correlation of the Superconducting Critical Temperature with Spin and Orbital Excitation Energies In (Ca{x}La{1-x})(Ba{1.75-x}La{0.25+x})Cu{3}O{y} as Measured by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering,True,"Recently a new family of Cr-based A2Cr3As3 (A = K, Rb, Cs) superconductors were reported, which own a rare quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) crystal structure with infinite (Cr3As3)2- chains and exhibit intriguing superconducting characteristics possibly derived from spin-triplet electron pairing. The crystal structure of A2Cr3As3 is actually a slight variation of the hexagonal TlFe3Te3 prototype although they have different lattice symmetry. Here we report superconductivity in a 133-type KCr3As3 compound that belongs to the latter structure. The single crystals of KCr3As3 were prepared by the deintercalation of K ions from K2Cr3As3 crystals which were grown from a high-temperature solution growth method, and it owns a centrosymmetric lattice in contrast to the non-centrosymmetric K2Cr3As3. After annealing at a moderate temperature, the KCr3As3 crystals show bulk superconductivity at 5 K revealed by electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements. The discovery of this KCr3As3 superconductor provides a different structural instance to study the exotic superconductivity in these Q1D Cr-based superconductors.","Electronic spin and orbital (dd) excitation spectra of (Ca{x}La{1-x})(Ba{1.75-x}La{0.25+x})Cu{3}O{y} samples are measured by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). In this compound, Tc of samples with identical hole dopings is strongly affected by the Ca/Ba substitution x due to subtle variations in the lattice constants, while crystal symmetry and disorder as measured by line-widths are x independent. We examine two extreme values of x and two extreme values of hole-doping content y corresponding to antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. The x dependence of the spin mode energies is approximately the same for both the antiferromagnetic and superconducting samples. This clearly demonstrates that RIXS is sensitive to J even in doped samples. A positive correlation between the superexchange J and the maximum of Tc at optimal doping Tc^{max} is observed. We also measured the x dependence of the d_{xy} -> d_{x^2-y^2} and d_{xz/yz} -> d_{x^2-y^2} orbital splittings. We infer that the effect of the unresolved d_{3z^2-r^2} -> d_{x^2-y^2} excitation on Tc^{max} is much smaller than the effect of J. There appears to be dispersion in the d_{xy} -> d_{x^2-y^2} peak of up to 0.05 eV. Our fitting of the peaks furthermore indicates an asymmetric dispersion for the d_{xz/yz} -> d_{x^2-y^2} excitation. A peak at ~0.8 eV is also observed, and attributed to a dd excitation in the chain layer.",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

Radio observations of extreme ULXs: revealing the most powerful ULX radio nebula ever or the jet of an intermediate-mass black hole?,MOND and IMF variations in early-type galaxies from $ATLAS^{3D}$,True,"The most extreme ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), with $L_\mathrm{X} > 5 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, are amongst the best candidates for hosting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in the haloes of galaxies. Jet radio emission is expected from a sub-Eddington accreting IMBH in the low/hard (radio bright) state. In a search for such IMBH jet radio emission, we have observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 5 GHz a sample of seven extreme ULXs whose X-ray properties indicate they are in the hard state. Assuming they remain in this state, the non-detection of radio emission for six of the target sources allows us to constrain their black hole mass to the IMBH regime, thus ruling out a supermassive black hole nature. For the extreme ULX in the galaxy NGC\,2276, we detect extended radio emission formed by two lobes of total flux density 1.43 $\pm$ 0.22 mJy and size $\sim$650 pc. The X-ray counterpart is located between the two lobes, suggesting the presence of a black hole with jet radio emission. The radio luminosity allows us to constrain the black hole mass of this source to the IMBH regime; hence, the extreme ULX in NGC\,2276 could be the first detection of extended jet radio emission from an IMBH. The radio emission could also possibly come from a radio nebula powered by the ULX with a minimum total energy of $5.9 \times 10^{52}$ erg, thus constituting the most powerful and largest ULX radio nebula ever observed.","MOdified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) represents a phenomenological alternative to dark matter (DM) for the missing mass problem in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. We analyze the central regions of a local sample of $\sim 220$ early-type galaxies from the $\rm ATLAS^{3D}$ survey, to see if the data can be reproduced without recourse to DM. We estimate dynamical masses in the MOND context through Jeans analysis, and compare to $\rm ATLAS^{3D}$ stellar masses from stellar population synthesis. We find that the observed stellar mass--velocity dispersion relation is steeper than expected assuming MOND with a fixed stellar initial mass function (IMF) and a standard value for the acceleration parameter $a_{\rm 0}$. Turning from the space of observables to model space, a) fixing the IMF, a universal value for $a_{\rm 0}$ cannot be fitted, while, b) fixing $a_{\rm 0}$ and leaving the IMF free to vary, we find that it is ""lighter"" (Chabrier-like) for low-dispersion galaxies, and ""heavier"" (Salpeter-like) for high dispersions.

Search for high energy {\gamma}-ray emission from galaxies of the Local Group with Fermi/LAT,Probing Correlations in the Binary Black Hole Population with Flexible Models,True,"With the discovery of high energy {\gamma}-ray emission from the Andromeda galaxy (M 31) by the Fermi/LAT collaboration, normal galaxies begin to arise from the shadows for the first time, providing insight on cosmic ray acceleration in external galaxies. We search for high energy {\gamma}-ray emission from galaxies in the Local Group which were not investigated so far: M 81, M 83, IC 342, Maffei 1, Maffei 2 and M 94. Fermi/LAT public data from August 4, 2008 to January 1, 2011 were analysed for these galaxies. We compare the results to other starburst and normal galaxies detected at high energies so far: the Magellanic clouds, M 31, and the starburst galaxies M 82 and NGC 253. No significant detection is found in the data for the sources in our sample, and we derive upper limits on their photon flux. Comparing the results to other Local Group objects, we find that the derived upper limits are fully compatible with expectations from cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium within the host galaxies. In the case of M 33 and M 83, a detection in Fermi/LAT data should be imminent. The expected fluxes for the other sources in the sample are below the sensitivity of Fermi/LAT, even after 10 years of observation. Collective emission from compact objects in the host galaxies is also found to be negligible compared to the expected emission from cosmic ray interactions.","The astrophysical formation channels of binary black hole systems predict correlations between their mass, spin, and redshift distributions, which can be probed with gravitational-wave observations. Population-level analysis of the latest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog of binary black hole mergers has identified evidence for such correlations assuming linear evolution of the mean and width of the effective spin distribution as a function of the binary mass ratio and merger redshift. However, the complex astrophysical processes at play in compact binary formation do not necessarily predict linear relationships between the distributions of these parameters. In this work, we relax the assumption of linearity and instead search for correlations using a more flexible cubic spline model. Our results suggest a nonlinear correlation between the width of the effective spin distribution and redshift. We also show that the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaborations may find convincing Bayesian evidence for nonlinear correlations by the end of the fourth observing run, O4.

Soft gamma-ray constraints on a bright flare from the Galactic Center supermassive black hole,Contrasting X-ray/UV time-lags in Seyfert 1 galaxies NGC 4593 and NGC 7469 using AstroSat observations,True,"Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the supermassive black hole residing at the center of the Milky Way. It has been the main target of an extensive multiwavelength campaign we carried out in April 2007. Herein, we report the detection of a bright flare from the vicinity of the horizon, observed simultaneously in X-rays (XMM/EPIC) and near infrared (VLT/NACO) on April 4th for 1-2 h. For the first time, such an event also benefitted from a soft gamma-rays (INTEGRAL/ISGRI) and mid infrared (VLT/VISIR) coverage, which enabled us to derive upper limits at both ends of the flare spectral energy distribution (SED). We discuss the physical implications of the contemporaneous light curves as well as the SED, in terms of synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton and external Compton emission processes.","We study accretion disk-corona connection in Seyfert 1 galaxies using simultaneous UV/X-ray observations of NGC 4593 (July 14-18, 2016) and NGC 7469 (October 15-19, 2017) performed with AstroSat. We use the X-ray (0.5-7.0 keV) data acquired with the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and the UV (FUV: 130-180 nm, NUV: 200-300 nm) data obtained with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). We also use the contemporaneous Swift observations of NGC 4593 and demonstrate AstroSat's capability for X-ray/UV correlation studies. We performed UV/X-ray cross-correlation analysis using the Interpolated and the Discrete Cross-Correlation Functions and found similar results. In the case of NGC 4593, we found that the variations in the X-rays lead to those in the FUV and NUV bands by ~ 38 ks and ~ 44 ks, respectively. These UV lags favour the disk reprocessing model, they are consistent with the previous results within uncertainties. In contrast, we found an opposite trend in NGC 7469 where the soft X-ray variations lag those in the FUV and NUV bands by ~ 41 ks and ~ 49 ks, respectively. The hard lags in NGC 7469 favour the Thermal Comptonization model. Our results may provide direct observational evidence for the variable intrinsic UV emission from the accretion disk which acts as the seed for thermal Comptonization in a hot corona in a lamp-post like geometry.

After constructing an appropriate order parameter to distinguish locally between the monoclinic B19' at low and the cubic B2 structure at high temperatures, the process of the phase transition is visualized. This shows a heterogeneous nucleation of austenite at the surface of the particles, which propagates to the interior by plane sliding, explaining a difference in austenite start and end temperatures.

Photometric and Spectroscopic analysis of four contact binaries,Asymmetric Distribution of the Solar Photospheric Magnetic Field Values,True,"We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of four W UMa binaries J015829.5+260333 (hereinafter as J0158), J030505.1+293443 (hereinafter as J0305), J102211.7+310022 (hereinafter as J1022) and KW Psc. The VRcIc band photometric observations are carried out with the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope. For low resolution spectroscopy, we used 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope as well as the archival data from 4-m LAMOST survey. The systems J0158 and J0305 show a period increase rate of 5.26(+/-1.72)x10^-7 days/yr and 1.78(+/-1.52)x10^-6 days/yr, respectively. The period of J1022 is found to be decreasing with a rate of 4.22(+/-1.67)x10^-6 days/yr. The period analysis of KW Psc displays no change in its period. PHOEBE package is used for the light curve modeling and basic parameters are evaluated with the help of GAIA parallax. The asymmetry of light curves is explained with the assumption of cool spots at specific positions on one of the components of the system. On the basis of temperatures, mass ratios, fill-out factors and periods, the system J1022 is identified as W-subtype systems while the others show some mixed properties. To probe the chromospheric activities in these W UMa binaries, their spectra are compared with the known inactive stars spectra. The comparison shows emission in H\alpha, H\beta and CaII. To understand the evolutionary status of these systems, the components are drawn in mass-radius and mass-luminosity planes with other well characterized binary systems. The secondary components of all the systems are away from ZAMS which indicates that secondary is more evolved than the primary component.","Understanding the characteristics of the solar magnetic field is essential for interpreting solar activities and dynamo. In this research, we investigated the asymmetric distribution of the solar photospheric magnetic field values, using synoptic charts constructed from space-borne high-resolution magnetograms. It is demonstrated that the Lorentzian function describes the distribution of magnetic field values in the synoptic charts much better than the Gaussian function, and this should reflect the gradual decay process from strong to weak magnetic fields. The asymmetry values are calculated under several circumstances, and the results generally show two periodicities related to the variation of the solar B$_0$ angle and the solar cycle, respectively. We argue that it is the small-scale magnetic fields, the inclination of the solar axis, the emergence and evolution of magnetic flux, and the polar fields that are responsible for the features of asymmetry values. We further determined the polar field reversal time of solar cycles 23 and 24 with the flip of asymmetry values. Specifically, for cycle 24, we assert that the polar polarities of both hemispheres reversed at the same time - in March 2014; as to cycle 23, the reversal time of the S-hemisphere is March 2001, while the determination of the N-hemisphere is hampered by missing data.",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"Solar and stellar astrophysics focuses on white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variables.

RG-improvement of the effective action with multiple mass scales,Probing photon structure in DVCS on a photon target,True,"Improving the effective action by the renormalization group (RG) with several mass scales is an important problem in quantum field theories. A method based on the decoupling theorem was proposed in \cite{Bando:1992wy} and systematically improved \cite{Casas:1998cf} to take threshold effects into account. In this paper, we apply the method to the Higgs-Yukawa model, including wave-function renormalizations, and to a model with two real scalar fields $(\varphi, h)$. In the Higgs-Yukawa model, even at one-loop level, Feynman diagrams contain propagators with different mass scales and decoupling scales must be chosen appropriately to absorb threshold corrections. On the other hand, in the two-scalar model, the mass matrix of the scalar fields is a function of their field values $(\varphi, h)$ and the resultant running couplings obey different RGEs on a different point of the field space. By solving the RGEs, we can obtain the RG improved effective action in the whole region of the scalar fields.","The factorization of the amplitude for the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) process gamma*(Q) gamma -> gamma gamma at high Q2 is demonstrated in two distinct kinematical domains, allowing to define the photon generalized parton distributions and the diphoton generalized distribution amplitudes.

Vortex rings in fragmentation regions in heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 39 GeV,"Higgs Vacuum Stability, Neutrino Mass, and Dark Matter",True,"Vorticity generated in heavy-ion collisions at energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 39 GeV is studied. Simulations are performed within a model of the three-fluid dynamics. A peculiar structure consisting of two vortex rings is found: one ring in the target fragmentation region and another one in the projectile fragmentation region. These rings are also formed in central collisions. The matter rotation is opposite in this two rings. These vortex rings are already formed at the early stage of the collision together with primordial fragmentation regions. The average vorticity, responsible for the global polarization of the observed $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$, is also studied. In the semi-central collisions the average vorticity in the midrapidity region turns out to be more than an order of magnitude lower than the total one. The total vorticity is dominated by the contributions of the fragmentation regions and is produced because of asymmetry of the vortex rings in noncentral collisions. This suggests that in semi-central collisions the global polarization in the fragmentation regions should be at least an order of magnitude higher than that observed by the STAR collaboration in the midrapidity. This polarization should be asymmetrical in the reaction plain and correlate with the corresponding directed flow.","Recent results from ATLAS and CMS point to a narrow range for the Higgs mass: $M_H\in[ 124, 126] {\rm GeV}$. Given this range, a case may be made for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) because of the resultant vacuum stability problem, i.e., the SM Higgs quartic coupling may run to negative values at a scale below the Planck scale. We study representative minimal extensions of the SM that can keep the SM Higgs vacuum stable to the Planck scale by introducing new scalar or fermion interactions at the TeV scale while solving other phenomenological problems. In particular, we consider the type-II seesaw model, which is introduced to explain the non-zero Majorana masses of the active neutrinos. Similarly, we observe that if the stability of the SM Higgs vacuum is ensured by the running of the gauge sector couplings, then one may require a series of new electroweak multiplets, the neutral component of which can be cold dark matter candidate. Stability may also point to a new U(1) gauge symmetry, in which the SM Higgs carries non-zero charge.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Parity violation in stochastic gravitational wave background from inflation,"hi_class: Background Evolution, Initial Conditions and Approximation Schemes",True,"We study the inflationary implications of a novel parity-violating gravity model, which modifies the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity by introducing the Nieh-Yan term coupled to an axion-like field. The parity-violating Nieh-Yan term results in the velocity birefringence of gravitational waves (GWs) and triggers the tachyonic instability only for one of the two circular polarization states. We consider that the inflaton is identified as the coupled axion-like field with a wiggly potential characterized by steep cliffs connected by smooth plateaus. During inflation, the temporary fast roll of axion on the cliff-like region leads to the significant enhancement of the tensor perturbations in one polarization state with the wave numbers that exit the horizon around this period. In this setup, the resulting energy spectrum for GWs presents a sizable localized bump involving the contribution of only one polarization state. This chiral GW background is detectable by LISA and Taiji, and its chirality can be determined by correlating two detectors, which provide an opportunity to probe the inflation and test the gravity model.","Cosmological datasets have great potential to elucidate the nature of dark energy and test gravity on the largest scales available to observation.

On the finite temperature Drude weight of the anisotropic Heisenberg chain,"Interplay of electron correlations, spin-orbit couplings, and structural effects for Cu centers in the quasi-two-dimensional magnet InCu$_{2/3}$V$_{1/3}$O$_3$",True,"We present a study of the Drude weight $D(T)$ of the spin-1/2 $XXZ$ chain in the gapless regime. The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) is applied in two different ways. In the first application we employ the particle basis of magnons and their bound states. In this case we rederive and considerably extend earlier work in the literature. However, in the course of our investigation we find arguments that cast doubt on the applicability of the TBA in this case. In a second application by use of the spinon and anti-spinon particle basis we obtain completely different results. Only for anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ close to 0 we find that $D(T)$ is a monotonously decaying function of temperature. For $\Delta$ close to 1 the behaviour is entirely different showing a finite temperature maximum. Also for the isotropic antiferromagnetic chain ($\Delta=1$) the results for $D(T)$ are finite for T=0 as well as for $T>0$ with an infinite positive slope at T=0.","Less common ligand coordination of transition-metal centers is often associated with peculiar valence-shell electron configurations and outstanding physical properties. One example is the Fe$^+$ ion with linear coordination, actively investigated in the research area of single-molecule magnetism. Here we address the nature of 3$d^9$ states for Cu$^{2+}$ ions sitting in the center of trigonal bipyramidal ligand cages in the quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb compound InCu$_{2/3}$V$_{1/3}$O$_3$, whose unusual magnetic properties were intensively studied in the recent past. In particular, we discuss the interplay of structural effects, electron correlations, and spin-orbit couplings in this material. A relevant computational finding is a different sequence of the Cu ($xz$, $yz$) and ($xy$, $x^2\!-\!y^2$) levels as compared to existing electronic-structure models, which has implications for the interpretation of various excitation spectra.

Single and double spin asymmetries for deeply virtual Compton scattering measured with CLAS and a longitudinally polarized proton target,Measuring light-by-light scattering at the LHC and FCC,True,"Single-beam, single-target, and double-spin asymmetries for hard exclusive photon production on the proton $\vec{e}\vec{p} \to e' p'\gamma$ are presented. The data were taken at Jefferson Lab using the CLAS detector and a longitudinally polarized ${}^{14}$NH$_3$ target. The three asymmetries were measured in 165 4-dimensional kinematic bins, covering the widest kinematic range ever explored simultaneously for beam and target-polarization observables in the valence quark region. The kinematic dependences of the obtained asymmetries are discussed and compared to the predictions of models of Generalized Parton Distributions. The measurement of three DVCS spin observables at the same kinematic points allows a quasi-model-independent extraction of the imaginary parts of the $H$ and $\tilde{H}$ Compton Form Factors, which give insight into the electric and axial charge distributions of valence quarks in the proton.","Elastic light-by-light scattering, $\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$, can be measured in electromagnetic interactions of lead (Pb) ions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC), using the large (quasi)real photon fluxes available in ultraperipheral collisions.

A transfer matrix method for the analysis of fractal quantum potentials,The group administered interactive questionnaire: An alternative to individual interviews,True,The scattering properties of quantum particles on fractal potentials at different stages of fractal growth are obtained by means of the transfer matrix method. This approach can be easily adopted for project assignments in introductory quantum mechanics for undergraduates. The reflection coefficients for both the fractal potential and the finite periodic potential are calculated and compared. It is shown that the reflection coefficient for the fractal has a self-similar structure associated with the fractal distribution of the potential.,"Individual interviews are often considered to be the gold standard for researchers to understand how people think about phenomena. However, conducting and analyzing interviews is very time consuming.

Life after eruption - II. The eclipsing old nova V728 Scorpii,Hyperons in neutron-star cores and two-solar-mass pulsar,True,"The old nova V728 Sco has been recently recovered via photometric and spectroscopic observations, 150 years after the nova eruption. The spectral properties pointed to a high-inclination system with a comparatively low mass-transfer rate. In this paper we show that the object is an eclipsing system with an orbital period of 3.32 h. It has enhanced long-term variability that can be interpreted as 'stunted' dwarf-nova-type outbursts. Using the ingress and egress times of the eclipsed components we calculate the radius of the central object. The latter turns out to be significantly larger than a white dwarf and we identify it with a hot inner disc. The implications for models on the behaviour of post-novae are discussed.","Recent measurement of mass of PSR J1614-2230 rules out most of existing models of equation of state (EOS) of dense matter with high-density softening due to hyperonization or a phase transition to quark matter or a boson condensate. We look for a solution of an apparent contradiction between the consequences stemming from up-to-date hypernuclear data, indicating appearance of hyperons at 3 nuclear densities and existence of a two-solar-mass neutron star. We consider a non-linear relativistic mean field (RMF) model involving baryon octet coupled to meson fields. An effective lagrangian includes quartic terms in the meson fields. The values of the parameters of the model are obtained by fitting semi-empirical parameters of nuclear matter at the saturation point, as well as potential wells for hyperons in nuclear matter and the strength of the Lambda-Lambda attraction in double-Lambda hypernuclei. We propose a non-linear RMF model which is consistent with up-to-date semiempirical nuclear and hypernuclear data and allows for neutron stars with hyperon cores and M larger than 2 solar masses. The model involves hidden-strangenes scalar and vector mesons, coupled to hyperons only, and quartic terms involving vector meson fields. Our EOS involving hyperons is stiffer than the corresponding nucleonic EOS (with hyperons artificially suppressed) above five nuclear densities. Required stiffening is generated by the quartic terms involving hidden-strangeness vector meson.",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"Solar and stellar astrophysics focuses on white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variables.

An extremal model for amorphous media plasticity,Optical conductivity of metals from first principles,True,"An extremal model for the plasticity of amorphous materials is studied in a simple two-dimensional anti-plane geometry. The steady-state is analyzed through numerical simulations. Long-range spatial and temporal correlations in local slip events are shown to develop, leading to non-trivial and highly anisotropic scaling laws. In particular, the plastic strain is shown to statistically concentrate over a region which tends to align perpendicular to the displacement gradient. By construction, the model can be seen as giving rise to a depinning transition, the threshold of which (i.e. the macroscopic yield stress) also reveal scaling properties reflecting the localization of the activity.","A computational method to obtain optical conductivities from first principles is presented. It exploits a relation between the conductivity and the complex dielectric function, which is constructed from the full electronic band structure within the random-phase approximation. In contrast to the Drude model, no empirical parameters are used. As interband transitions as well as local-field effects are properly included, the calculated spectra are valid over a wide frequency range. As an illustration I present quantitative results for selected simple metals, noble metals, and ferromagnetic transition metals.

Improving sound absorption through nonlinear active electroacoustic resonators,Bidirectional electro-optic conversion reaching 1% efficiency with thin-film lithium niobate,True,"Absorbing airborne noise at frequencies below 300 Hz is a particularly vexing problem due to the absence of natural sound absorbing materials at these frequencies. The prevailing solution for low-frequency sound absorption is the use of passive narrow-band resonators, whose absorption level and bandwidth can be further enhanced using nonlinear effects. However, these effects are typically triggered at high intensity levels, without much control over the form of the nonlinear absorption mechanism. In this study, we propose, implement, and experimentally demonstrate a nonlinear active control framework on an electroacoustic resonator prototype, allowing for unprecedented control over the form of non-linearity, and arbitrarily low sound intensity thresholds. More specifically, the proposed architecture combines a linear feedforward control on the front pressure through a first microphone located at the front face of the loudspeaker, and a nonlinear feedback on the membrane displacement estimated through the measurement of the pressure inside the back cavity with a second microphone located in the enclosure. It is experimentally shown that even at a weak excitation level, it is possible to observe and control the nonlinear behaviour of the system. Taking the cubic nonlinearity as an example, we demonstrate numerically and experimentally that in the low frequency range ([50 Hz, 500 Hz]), the nonlinear control law allows improving the sound absorption performance, i.e. enlarging the bandwidth of optimal sound absorption while increasing the maximal absorption coefficient value, and producing only a negligible amount of nonlinear distortion. The reported experimental methodology can be extended to implement various types of hybrid linear and/or nonlinear controls, thus opening new avenues for managing wave nonlinearity and achieving non-trivial wave phenomena.","Superconducting cavity electro-optics (EO) presents a promising route to coherently convert microwave and optical photons and distribute quantum entanglement between superconducting circuits over long-distance through an optical network. High EO conversion efficiency demands transduction materials with strong Pockels effect and excellent optical transparency. Thin-film Lithium Niobate (TFLN) offers these desired characteristics however so far has only delivered unidirectional conversion with efficiencies on the order of $10^{-5}$, largely impacted by its prominent photorefractive (PR) effect at cryogenic temperatures. Here we show that, by mitigating the PR effect and associated charge-screening effect, the device's conversion efficiency can be enhanced by orders of magnitude while maintaining stable cryogenic operation, thus allowing a demonstration of conversion bidirectionality and accurate quantification of on-chip efficiency. With the optimized monolithic integrated superconducting EO device based on TFLN-on-sapphire substrate, an on-chip conversion efficiency of 1.02% (internal efficiency, 15.2%) is realized. Our demonstration indicates that with further device improvement, it is feasible for TFLN to approach unitary internal conversion efficiency.",Applied Physics,"Applied physics focuses on applications of physics to new technology, including electronic devices, optics, photonics, microwaves, spintronics, advanced materials, metamaterials, nanotechnology, and energy sciences."
Supercooled Liquids under Shear: Computational Approach,The effect of curvature on cholesteric doughnuts,True,"We have performed molecular dynamics simulations for a model two-dimensional soft-core mixture in a supercooled state. The mixture exhibits a slow structural relaxation in a quiescent state, however, the relaxation is much enhanced in sheared states. There observed surprisingly small anisotropy both in the coherent and incoherent density correlation functions even under extremely strong shear which is $10^3$ times faster than the structural relaxation rate. The present simulation results agree well with predictions of the recently developed mode-coupling theory in shear.","The confinement of liquid crystals inside curved geometries leads to exotic structures, with applications ranging from bio-sensors to optical switches and privacy windows. Here we study how curvature affects the alignment of a cholesteric liquid crystal. We model the system on the mesoscale using the Landau-de Gennes model. Our study was performed in three stages, analysing different curved geometries from cylindrical walls and pores, to toroidal domains, in order to isolate the curvature effects. Our results show that the stresses introduced by the curvature influence the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules, and cause distortions in the natural periodicity of the cholesteric that depend on the radius of curvature and on the commensurability between the pitch and the dimensions of the system. In particular, the cholesteric layers of toroidal droplets exhibit a symmetry breaking not seen in cylindrical pores and that is driven by the additional curvature.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

The cross sections were measured using jets clustered with the anti-kT algorithm with parameters R=0.4 and R=0.6. These measurements are based on the 2010 data sample, consisting of a total integrated luminosity of 37 inverse picobarns. Inclusive jet double-differential cross sections are presented as a function of jet transverse momentum, in bins of jet rapidity. Dijet double-differential cross sections are studied as a function of the dijet invariant mass, in bins of half the rapidity separation of the two leading jets. The measurements are performed in the jet rapidity range |y|<4.4, covering jet transverse momenta from 20 GeV to 1.5 TeV and dijet invariant masses from 70 GeV to 5 TeV.

Properties of a thin accretion disk around a rotating non-Kerr black hole,An Eclipsing Black Widow Pulsar in NGC 6712,True,"We study the accretion process in the thin disk around a rotating non-Kerr black hole with a deformed parameter and an unbound rotation parameter. Our results show that the presence of the deformed parameter $\epsilon$ modifies the standard properties of the disk. For the case in which the black hole is more oblate than a Kerr black hole, the larger deviation leads to the smaller energy flux, the lower radiation temperature and the fainter spectra luminosity in the disk. For the black hole with positive deformed parameter, we find that the effect of the deformed parameter on the disk becomes more complicated. It depends not only on the rotation direction of the black hole and the orbit particles, but also on the sign of the difference between the deformed parameter $\epsilon$ and a certain critical value $\epsilon_{c}$. These significant features in the mass accretion process may provide a possibility to test the no-hair theorem in the strong field regime in future astronomical observations.","We report the discovery of the first radio pulsar associated with NGC 6712, an eclipsing black widow (BW) pulsar, J1853$-$0842A, found by high-sensitivity searches using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. This 2.15 ms pulsar is in a 3.56 hr compact circular orbit with a very low mass companion likely of mass 0.018 to 0.036 $M_{\rm \odot}$ and exhibits eclipsing of the pulsar signal. Though the distance to PSR J1853$-$0842A predicted from its dispersion measure ($155.125 \pm 0.004$ cm$^{-3}$ pc) and Galactic free electron density models are about 30\% smaller than that of NGC 6712 obtained from interstellar reddening measurements, this is likely due to limited knowledge about the spiral arms and Scutum stellar cloud in this direction. Follow-up timing observations spanning 445 days allow us to localize the pulsar's position to be 0.14 core radii from the center of NGC 6712 and measure a negative spin-down rate for this pulsar of $-2.39(2)\times10^{-21}\rm s s^{-1}$. The latter cannot be explained without the acceleration of the GC and decisively supports the association between PSR J1853--0842A and NGC 6712. Considering the maximum GC acceleration, Galactic acceleration, and Shklovskii effect, we place an upper limit on the intrinsic spin-down rate to be $1.11\times10^{-20}\rm~s~s^{-1}$. From an analysis of the eclipsing observations, we estimate the electron density of the eclipse region to be about $1.88\times10^6\rm cm^{-3}$.

Simulation consensus model of never changed opinions in Sznajd consensus model using multi-spin coding,Bose-Einstein condensation in a one-dimensional interacting system due to power-law trapping potentials,True,"The density of never changed opinions during the Sznajd consensus-finding process decays with time t as 1/t^{theta}. We find theta ~= 3/8 for a chain, compatible with the exact Ising result of Derrida et al. In higher dimensions, however, the exponent differs from the Ising theta. With simultaneous updating of sublattices instead of the usual random sequential updating, the number of persistent opinions decays roughly exponentially.

Exploring dynamical magnetism with time-dependent density-functional theory: from spin fluctuations to Gilbert damping,Weighted network modules,True,"We use time-dependent spin-density-functional theory to study dynamical magnetic phenomena. First, we recall that the local-spin-density approximation (LSDA) fails to account correctly for magnetic fluctuations in the paramagnetic state of iron and other itinerant ferromagnets. Next, we construct a gradient-dependent density functional that does not suffer from this problem of the LSDA. This functional is then used to derive, for the first time, the phenomenological Gilbert equation of micromagnetics directly from time-dependent density-functional theory. Limitations and extensions of Gilbert damping are discussed on this basis, and some comparisons with phenomenological theories and experiments are made.","The inclusion of link weights into the analysis of network properties allows a deeper insight into the (often overlapping) modular structure of real-world webs. We introduce a clustering algorithm (CPMw, Clique Percolation Method with weights) for weighted networks based on the concept of percolating k-cliques with high enough intensity. The algorithm allows overlaps between the modules. First, we give detailed analytical and numerical results about the critical point of weighted k-clique percolation on (weighted) Erdos-Renyi graphs. Then, for a scientist collaboration web and a stock correlation graph we compute three-link weight correlations and with the CPMw the weighted modules. After reshuffling link weights in both networks and computing the same quantities for the randomised control graphs as well, we show that groups of 3 or more strong links prefer to cluster together in both original graphs.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Electronic and hole minibands in quantum wire arrays of different crystallographic structure,Origin of Nonlinear Damping due to Mode Coupling in Auto-Oscillatory Modes Strongly Driven by Spin-Orbit Torque,True,"We consider quantum wire arrays consisting of GaAs rods embedded in Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As and disposed in sites of a square or triangular lattice. The electronic and hole spectra around the conduction band bottom and the valence band top are examined versus geometry of the lattice formed by the rods, concentration of Al in the matrix material, and structural parameters including the filling fraction and the lattice constant. Our calculations use the envelope function and are based on the effective-mass approximation. We show that the electronic and hole spectra resulting from the periodicity of the heterostructure, depend on the factors considered and that the effect of lattice geometry varies substantially with lattice constant. For low lattice constant values the minigaps are significantly wider in the case of triangular lattice, while for high lattice constant values wider minigaps occur in the square lattice-based arrays. We analyse the consequences of our findings for the efficiency of solar cells based on quantum wire arrays.","We investigate the physical origin of nonlinear damping due to mode coupling between several auto-oscillatory modes driven by spin-orbit torque in constricted Py/Pt heterostructures by examining the dependence of auto-oscillation on temperature and applied field orientation. We observe a transition in the nonlinear damping of the auto-oscillation modes extracted from the total oscillation power as a function of drive current, which coincides with the onset of power redistribution amongst several modes and the crossover from linewidth narrowing to linewidth broadening in all individual modes. This indicates the activation of another relaxation process by nonlinear magnon-magnon scattering within the modes. We also find that both nonlinear damping and threshold current in the mode-interaction damping regime at high drive current after transition are temperature independent, suggesting that the mode coupling occurs dominantly through a non-thermal magnon scattering process via a dipole or exchange interaction rather than thermally excited magnon-mediated scattering. This finding presents a promising pathway to overcome the current limitations of efficiently controlling the interaction between two highly nonlinear magnetic oscillators to prevent mode crosstalk or inter-mode energy transfer and deepens understanding of complex nonlinear spin dynamics in multimode spin wave systems.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Comparison of Recent SnIa datasets,Exploring anomalous $hb\bar b$ and $h b\bar b\gamma$ couplings in the context of the LHC and an $e^+e^-$ collider,True,"We rank the six latest Type Ia supernova (SnIa) datasets (Constitution (C), Union (U), ESSENCE (Davis) (E), Gold06 (G), SNLS 1yr (S) and SDSS-II (D)) in the context of the Chevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(a)=w_0+w_1 (1-a)$, according to their Figure of Merit (FoM), their consistency with the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM), their consistency with standard rulers (Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)) and their mutual consistency. We find a significant improvement of the FoM (defined as the inverse area of the 95.4% parameter contour) with the number of SnIa of these datasets ((C) highest FoM, (U), (G), (D), (E), (S) lowest FoM). Standard rulers (CMB+BAO) have a better FoM by about a factor of 3, compared to the highest FoM SnIa dataset (C). We also find that the ranking sequence based on consistency with $\Lambda$CDM is identical with the corresponding ranking based on consistency with standard rulers ((S) most consistent, (D), (C), (E), (U), (G) least consistent). The ranking sequence of the datasets however changes when we consider the consistency with an expansion history corresponding to evolving dark energy $(w_0,w_1)=(-1.4,2)$ crossing the phantom divide line $w=-1$ (it is practically reversed to (G), (U), (E), (S), (D), (C)). The SALT2 and MLCS2k2 fitters are also compared and some peculiar features of the SDSS-II dataset when standardized with the MLCS2k2 fitter are pointed out. Finally, we construct a statistic to estimate the internal consistency of a collection of SnIa datasets. We find that even though there is good consistency among most samples taken from the above datasets, this consistency decreases significantly when the Gold06 (G) dataset is included in the sample.","In the light of the 125 GeV Higgs ($h$) discovery at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), one of the primary goals of the LHC and possible future colliders is to understand its interactions more precisely.

Their role in some detectable final states have been compared with those coming from anomalous $h$-$b$-$\bar b$ interactions. We have considered the bounds coming from the existing collider and other low energy experimental data in order to derive constraints on the potential new physics couplings and predict possible collider signals for the two different new physics scenarios in the context of 14 TeV LHC and and a future $e^+e^-$ machine.

Approximate Ginsparg-Wilson Fermions for QCD,Quark-gluon plasma phenomenology from anisotropic lattice QCD,True,"Lattice fermions obeying the Ginsparg-Wilson relation do correctly represent the physical properties related to chirality. This can be achieved by local fermions, which involve an infinite number of couplings, however. For practical purposes, it is useful to first construct approximate Ginsparg-Wilson fermions within a short range. We report on a successful construction in QCD at \beta =6. The good quality of the approximation is observed from the spectrum, which is situated close to a Ginsparg-Wilson circle. These fermions also provide an excellent approximation to rotational symmetry and they are promising for a good scaling, since they arise from the perfect action framework. Their insertion into the overlap formula renders the Ginsparg-Wilson relation exact. It leads to an improved overlap fermion with a high level of locality. This insertion is statistically on safe grounds at about \beta > 5.6.","The FASTSUM collaboration has been carrying out simulations of N_f=2+1 QCD at nonzero temperature in the fixed-scale approach using anisotropic lattices.

Softening of Roton and Phonon Modes in a Bose-Einstein Condensate with Spin-Orbit Coupling,The Fine Structure of the Phonon in One Dimension from Quantum Hydrodynamics,True,"Roton-type excitations usually emerge from strong correlations or long-range interactions, as in superfluid helium or dipolar ultracold atoms. However, in weakly short-range interacting quantum gas, the recently synthesized spin-orbit (SO) coupling can lead to various unconventional phases of superfluidity, and give rise to an excitation spectrum of roton-maxon character. Using Bragg spectroscopy we study a SO coupled Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms, and show that the excitation spectrum in a ""magnetized"" phase clearly possesses a two-branch and roton-maxon structure. As Raman coupling strength $\Omega$ is decreased, a roton-mode softening is observed, as a precursor of the phase transition to a stripe phase that spontaneously breaks spatially translational symmetry. The measured roton gaps agree well with theoretical calculations. Further, we determine sound velocities both in the magnetized and the non-magnetized phase, and a phonon-mode softening is observed around the phase transition in between. The validity of the $f$-sum rule is examined.","We show that the resonant interactions between phonons in one dimension may be treated consistently within Quantum Hydrodynamics by the introduction of phonon dispersion.

We illustrate the method by studying simple 6D brane world compactifications. We introduce the background geometries induced by the branes, and summarize the main physical features observed in the fluctuation spectra. We compare these results with 5D brane world models and the traditional Kaluza-Klein picture.","Scattering amplitudes with spinning particles are shown to decompose into multiple copies of simple building blocks to all loop orders, which can be used to efficiently reduce these amplitudes to sums over scalar integrals. Absence of unphysical kinematic singularities cleanly exposed by the method uncover novel consistency relations among master integrals and their coefficients. Analytic results are obtained for the five gluon, two loop, and four gluon, three loop planar scattering amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills theory as well as for leading singularities to even higher orders.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

ALMA Observations of the Host Galaxy of GRB090423 at z=8.23: Deep Limits on Obscured Star Formation 630 Million Years After the Big Bang,Hot Stuff for One Year (HSOY) - A 583 million star proper motion catalogue derived from Gaia DR1 and PPMXL,True,"We present rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) and optical observations of the host galaxy of GRB090423 at z=8.23 from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the Spitzer Space Telescope, respectively. The host remains undetected to 3-sigma limits of Fnu(222 GHz)<33 microJy and Fnu(3.6 micron)<81 nJy. The FIR limit is about 20 times fainter than the luminosity of the local ULIRG Arp220, and comparable to the local starburst M82. Comparing to model spectral energy distributions we place a limit on the IR luminosity of L_IR(8-1000 micron)<3e10 Lsun, corresponding to a limit on the obscured star formation rate of SFR_IR<5 Msun/yr; for comparison, the limit on the unobscured star formation rate from Hubble Space Telescope rest-frame UV observations is SFR_UV<1 Msun/yr. We also place a limit on the host galaxy stellar mass of <5e7 Msun (for a stellar population age of 100 Myr and constant star formation rate). Finally, we compare our millimeter observations to those of field galaxies at z>4 (Lyman break galaxies, Ly-alpha emitters, and submillimeter galaxies), and find that our limit on the FIR luminosity is the most constraining to date, although the field galaxies have much larger rest-frame UV/optical luminosities than the host of GRB090423 by virtue of their selection techniques. We conclude that GRB host galaxies at z>4, especially those with measured interstellar medium metallicities from afterglow spectroscopy, are an attractive sample for future ALMA studies of high redshift obscured star formation.","Recently, the first installment of data from ESA's Gaia astrometric satellite mission (Gaia-DR1) was released, containing positions of more than 1 billion stars with unprecedented precision, as well as only proper motions and parallaxes, however only for a subset of 2 million objects. The second release, due in late 2017 or early 2018, will include those quantities for most objects. In order to provide a dataset that bridges the time gap between the Gaia-DR1 and Gaia-DR2 releases and partly remedies the lack of proper motions in the former, HSOY (""Hot Stuff for One Year"") was created as a hybrid catalogue between Gaia-DR1 and ground-based astrometry, featuring proper motions (but no parallaxes) for a large fraction of the DR1 objects. While not attempting to compete with future Gaia releases in terms of data quality or number of objects, the aim of HSOY is to provide improved proper motions partly based on Gaia data, allowing some studies to be carried out just now or as pilot studies for later larger projects requiring higher-precision data. The HSOY catalogue was compiled using the positions taken from Gaia-DR1 combined with the input data from the PPMXL catalogue, employing the same weighted least-squares technique that was used to assemble the PPMXL catalogue itself. Results. This effort resulted in a four-parameter astrometric catalogue containing 583,000,000 objects, with Gaia-DR1 quality positions and proper motions with precisions from significantly less than 1 mas/yr to 5 mas/yr, depending on the object's brightness and location on the sky.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Non-perturbative renormalization: a new way,Instantons in QCD with Many Colors,True,"The notion of non-perturbative renormalization is discussed and extended. Within the extended picture, a new non-perturbative representation for the generating functional of Green functions of quantum field theories is suggested. It is argued that the new expression agrees with the standard renormalized perturbation theory if the latter is renormalized in an appropriate renormalization scheme.",We study instantons in QCD with many colors. We first discuss a number of qualitative arguments concerning the large N_c scaling behavior of a random instanton ensemble. We show that most hadronic observables are compatible with standard large N_c counting rules provided the average instanton size is O(1) and the instanton density is O(N_c) in the large N_c limit. This is not the case for the topological susceptibility and the mass of the eta'. For these observables consistency with conventional large N_c counting requires that fluctuations in the instanton liquid are suppressed compared to Poissonian fluctuations. Using mean field estimates and numerical simulations we show that the required scaling behavior of the instanton density is natural in models in which the instanton density is regularized in terms of a classical repulsive core. We also show that in these models fluctuations of the topological charge are suppressed and that m^2_eta'=O(1/N_c). We conclude that the instanton liquid model is not necessarily in conflict with the 1/N_c expansion.,High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Model-independent Constraint on the Neutrino Mass Spectrum from the Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay,Compositeness of near-threshold exotic hadrons with decay and coupled-channel effects,True,"We present a concise formula to relate the effective mass term of the neutrinoless double beta decay to a single neutrino mass, two Majorana CP-violating phases and four observables of neutrino oscillations for a generic neutrino mass spectrum. If the alleged evidence for the neutrinoless double beta decay is taken into account, one may obtain a rough but model-independent constraint on the absolute scale of neutrino masses -- it is most likely to be in the range between 0.1 eV and 1 eV.","The near-threshold exotic hadrons such as $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$ are naively considered as the hadronic molecular state from the viewpoint of the low-energy universality. However, it is also known that the elementary dominant state is not completely excluded as the internal structure of the near-threshold states. Furthermore, the dominance of molecules is expected to be modified by the decay or coupled channels. We discuss these features of the near-threshold bound states by calculating the compositeness with the effective field theory.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Thermoelectric Signal Enhancement by Reconciling the Spin Seebeck and Anomalous Nernst Effects in Ferromagnet/Non-magnet Multilayers,A laser-ARPES study of LaNiO3 thin films grown by sputter deposition,True,"The utilization of ferromagnetic (FM) materials in thermoelectric devices allows one to have a simpler structure and/or independent control of electric and thermal conductivities, which may further remove obstacles for this technology to be realized. The thermoelectricity in FM/non-magnet (NM) heterostructures using an optical heating source is studied as a function of NM materials and a number of multilayers. It is observed that the overall thermoelectric signal in those structures which is contributed by spin Seebeck effect and anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) is enhanced by a proper selection of NM materials with a spin Hall angle that matches to the sign of the ANE. Moreover, by an increase of the number of multilayer, the thermoelectric voltage is enlarged further and the device resistance is reduced, simultaneously. The experimental observation of the improvement of thermoelectric properties may pave the way for the realization of magnetic-(or spin-) based thermoelectric devices.","Thin films of the correlated transition-metal oxide LaNiO$_3$ undergo a metal-insulator transition when their thickness is reduced to a few unit cells. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to study the evolution of the electronic structure across this transition in a series of epitaxial LaNiO$_3$ films of thicknesses ranging from 19 to 2 u.c. grown in situ by RF magnetron sputtering. Our data show a strong reduction of the electronic mean free path as the thickness is reduced below 5 u.c. This prevents the system from becoming electronically two-dimensional, as confirmed by the largely unchanged Fermi surface seen in our experiments. In the insulating state we observe a strong suppression of the coherent quasiparticle peak but no clear gap.

Cosmic Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy,Extreme & High Synchrotron Peak Blazars beyond 4FGL: The 2BIGB $\rm \gamma$-ray catalogue,True,"Gamma-ray instrumentation for astronomical spectroscopy consists of multiple-interaction detectors in space combined with sophisticated post-processing of detector events on ground. Spectral signatures in the MeV regime originate from transitions in the nuclei of atoms (rather than in their electron shell). Nuclear transitions are stimulated by either radioactive decays or high-energy nuclear collisions such as with cosmic rays. Gamma-ray lines have been detected from radioactive isotopes produced in nuclear burning inside stars and supernovae, and from energetic-particle interactions in solar flares. 56Ni directly reflects the source of supernova light. The paucity of corresponding 44Ti gamma-ray line sources reflects the variety of dynamical conditions herein. 26Al and 60Fe are dispersed in interstellar space from massive-star nucleosynthesis over millions of years. Gamma-rays from their decay are measured in detail by gamma-ray telescopes, astrophysical interpretations reach from massive-star interiors to dynamical processes in the interstellar medium. Nuclear de-excitation gamma-ray lines have been found in solar-flare events, and convey information about energetic-particle production in these events, and their interaction in the solar atmosphere. The annihilation of positrons leads to another type of cosmic gamma-ray source. The characteristic annihilation gamma-rays at 511 keV have been measured long ago in solar flares, and now throughout the interstellar medium of our Milky Way galaxy. But now a puzzle has appeared, as a surprising predominance of the central bulge region was determined. This requires either new positron sources or transport processes not yet known to us. In this paper we discuss instrumentation and data processing for cosmic gamma-ray spectroscopy, and the astrophysical issues and insights from these measurements.","This paper presents the results of a $\rm \gamma$-ray likelihood analysis over all the extreme and high synchrotron peak blazars (EHSP & HSP) from the 3HSP catalogue. We investigate 2013 multifrequency positions under the eyes of Fermi Large Area Telescope, considering 11 years of observations in the energy range between 500 MeV to 500 GeV, which results in 1160 $\rm \gamma$-ray signatures detected down to the TS = 9 threshold. The detections include 235 additional sources concerning the Fermi Large Area Telescope Fourth Source Catalog (4FGL), all confirmed via high-energy TS maps, and represent an improvement of ~25% for the number of EHSP & HSP currently described in $\rm \gamma$-rays. We build the $\rm \gamma$-ray spectral energy distribution for all the 1160 2BIGB sources, plot the corresponding $\rm \gamma$-ray logN-logS, and measure their total contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background, which reaches up to ~33% at 100 GeV. Also, we show that the $\rm \gamma$-ray detectability improves according to the synchrotron peak flux as represented by the Figure of Merit (FOM) parameter, and note that the search for TeV peaked blazars may benefit from considering HSP and EHSP as a whole, instead of EHSPs only.

"Nanoscale structures formed in silicon cleavage studied with large-scale electronic structure alculations; surface reconstruction, step and bending",How to realize a negative refractive index material at the atomic level in an optical frequency range,True,"The 10-nm-scale structure in silicon cleavage is studied by the quantum mechanical calculations for large-scale electronic structure. The cleavage process on the order of 10 ps shows surface reconstruction and step formation. These processes are studied by analyzing electronic freedom and compared with STM experiments. The discussion presents the stability mechanism of the experimentally observed mode, the $(111)$-$(2 x 1)$ mode, beyond the traditional approach with surface energy. Moreover, in several results, the cleavage path is bent into the experimentally observed planes, owing to the relative stability among different cleavage modes. Finally, several common aspects between cleavage and other phenomena are discussed from the viewpoints of the nonequilibrium process and the 10-nm-scale structure.","The theoretical mechanism for realizing the negative refractive index with {\it electromagnetically induced transparency} (EIT) is studied. It is shown that in a three-level dense atomic gas, there is a frequency band in which the EIT medium will exhibit simultaneously negative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in the optical frequency range, and the atomic gas thus becomes a left-handed material. The expressions for the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability for the probe frequency is presented. One of the remarkable features of the present novel scheme is such that the obtained EIT left-handed material is {\it isotropic} and may therefore have some potentially important applications in the development of new techniques in quantum optics.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Branching Fractions and CP Asymmetries of the Quasi-Two-Body Decays in $B_{s} \to K^0(\overline K^0)K^\pm \pi^\mp$ within PQCD Approach,Hadron-hadron total cross sections and soft high-energy scattering on the lattice,True,"Motivated by the first untagged decay-time-integrated amplitude analysis of $B_s \to K_SK^{\mp}\pi^{\pm}$ decays performed by LHCb collaboration, where the decay amplitudes are modeled to contain the resonant contributions from intermediate resonances $K^*(892)$, $K_0^*(1430)$ and $K_2^*(1430)$, we comprehensively investigate the quasi-two-body $B_{s} \to K^0/\overline{\kern -0.2em K}^0 K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ decays, and calculate the branching fractions and the time-dependent $CP$ asymmetries within the perturbative QCD approach based on the $k_T$ factorization. In the quasi-two-body space region the calculated branching fractions with the considered intermediate resonances are in good agreement with the experimental results of LHCb by adopting proper $K\pi$ pair wave function, describing the interaction between the kaon and pion in the $K\pi$ pair. Furthermore,within the obtained branching fractions of the quasi-two-body decays, we also calculate the branching fractions of corresponding two-body decays, and the results consist with the LHCb measurements and the earlier studies with errors. For these considered decays, since the final states are not flavour-specific, the time-dependent $CP$ could be measured. We calculate six $CP$-violation observables, which can be tested in the ongoing LHCb experiment.","The nonperturbative approach to soft high-energy hadron-hadron scattering, based on the analytic continuation of Euclidean Wilson-loop correlation functions, makes possible the investigation of the problem of the asymptotic energy dependence of hadron-hadron total cross sections by means of lattice calculations.

Simulations of the Microwave Sky,Rotation curve decompositions with Gaussian Processes: taking into account data correlations leads to unbiased results,True,"We create realistic, full-sky, half-arcminute resolution simulations of the microwave sky matched to the most recent astrophysical observations. The primary purpose of these simulations is to test the data reduction pipeline for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) experiment; however, we have widened the frequency coverage beyond the ACT bands to make these simulations applicable to other microwave background experiments. Some of the novel features of these simulations are that the radio and infrared galaxy populations are correlated with the galaxy cluster populations, the CMB is lensed by the dark matter structure in the simulation via a ray-tracing code, the contribution to the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signals from galaxy clusters, groups, and the IGM has been included, and the gas prescription to model the SZ signals matches the most recent X-ray observations. Regarding the contamination of cluster SZ flux by radio galaxies, we find for 148 GHz (90 GHz) only 3% (4%) of halos have their SZ decrements contaminated at a level of 20% or more. We find the contamination levels higher for infrared galaxies. However, at 90 GHz, less than 20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<1.2 have their SZ decrements filled in at a level of 20% or more. At 148 GHz, less than 20% of clusters with M_{200} > 2.5 x 10^{14} Msun and z<0.8 have their SZ decrements filled in at a level of 50% or larger. Our models also suggest that a population of very high flux infrared galaxies, which are likely lensed sources, contribute most to the SZ contamination of very massive clusters at 90 and 148 GHz. These simulations are publicly available and should serve as a useful tool for microwave surveys to cross-check SZ cluster detection, power spectrum, and cross-correlation analyses.",Correlations between velocity measurements in disk galaxy rotation curves are usually neglected when fitting dynamical models.

Shear viscosity of an ultrarelativistic Boltzmann gas with isotropic inelastic scattering processes,Recovering information in an asymptotically flat spacetime in quantum gravity,True,We derive an analytic expression for the shear viscosity of an ultra-relativistic gas in presence of both elastic $2\to 2$ and inelastic $2\leftrightarrow 3$ processes with isotropic differential cross sections. The derivation is based on the entropy principle and Grad's approximation for the off-equilibrium distribution function. The obtained formula relates the shear viscosity coefficient $\eta$ to the total cross sections $\sigma_{22}$ and $\sigma_{23}$ of the elastic resp. inelastic processes. The values of shear viscosity extracted using the Green-Kubo formula from kinetic transport calculations are shown to be in excellent agreement with the analytic results which demonstrates the validity of the derived formula.,"As an extension of arXiv:\{2002.02448, 2008.10740\} we present a physical protocol that a set of observers can use to detect a pure state in the bulk when they are spread across a small cut near $\mathcal{I}^+_-$ in flat spacetime. The protocol involves the modification of a bulk state using simple unitary operators and measurements of the energy of the state. The states that we study are constructed by acting with low energy operators on a vacuum state such that a perturbative analysis is valid.

Mechanisms of SiO oxidation: Implications for dust formation,Cosmic evolution of the H2 mass density and the epoch of molecular gas,True,"Reactions of SiO molecules have been postulated to initiate efficient formation of silicate dust particles in outflows around dying (AGB) stars. Both OH radicals and H$_2$O molecules can be present in these environments and their reactions with SiO and the smallest SiO cluster, Si$_2$O$_2$, affect the efficiency of eventual dust formation. Rate coefficients of gas-phase oxidation and clustering reactions of SiO, Si$_2$O$_2$ and Si$_2$O$_3$ have been calculated using master equation calculations based on density functional theory calculations. The calculations show that the reactions involving OH are fast. Reactions involving H$_2$O are not efficient routes to oxidation but may under the right conditions lead to hydroxylated species. The reaction of Si$_2$O$_2$ with H$_2$O, which has been suggested as efficient producing Si$_2$O$_3$, is therefore not as efficient as previously thought. If H$_2$O molecules dissociate to form OH radicals, oxidation of SiO and dust formation could be accelerated. Kinetics simulations of oxygen-rich circumstellar environments using our proposed reaction scheme suggest that under typical conditions only small amounts of SiO$_2$ and Si$_2$O$_2$ are formed and that most of the silicon remains as molecular SiO.","We present new empirical constraints on the evolution of $\rho_{\rm H_2}$, the cosmological mass density of molecular hydrogen, back to $z\approx2.5$. We employ a statistical approach measuring the average observed $850\mu{\rm m}$ flux density of near-infrared selected galaxies as a function of redshift. The redshift range considered corresponds to a span where the $850\mu{\rm m}$ band probes the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of thermal dust emission in the rest-frame, and can therefore be used as an estimate of the mass of the interstellar medium (ISM). Our sample comprises of ${\approx}150,000$ galaxies in the UKIDSS-UDS field with near-infrared magnitudes $K_{\rm AB}\leq25$ mag and photometric redshifts with corresponding probability distribution functions derived from deep 12-band photometry. With a sample approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than in previous works we significantly reduce statistical uncertainties on $\rho_{\rm H_2}$ to $z\approx2.5$. Our measurements are in broad agreement with recent direct estimates from blank field molecular gas surveys, finding that the epoch of molecular gas coincides with the peak epoch of star formation with $\rho_{\rm H_2}\approx2\times10^7\,{\rm M_\odot}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z\approx2$. We demonstrate that $\rho_{\rm H_2}$ can be broadly modelled by inverting the star-formation rate density with a fixed or weakly evolving star-formation efficiency. This 'constant efficiency' model shows a similar evolution to our statistically derived $\rho_{\rm H_2}$, indicating that the dominant factor driving the peak star formation history at $z\approx2$ is a larger supply of molecular gas in galaxies rather than a significant evolution of the star-formation rate efficiency within individual galaxies.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

"Axial Anomaly, Mismatched Fermi Surfaces and Vector Interaction in Dense Neutral Quark Matter",On the bounds for the curvature and higher derivatives of the Isgur-Wise function,True,"We report on effects of the q-$\bar{\rm q}$ vector interaction and/or the U(1)$_A$-anomaly-induced chiral-diquark coupling on the charge-neutral quark matter in $\beta$-equilibrium. We show that when the vector coupling is absent, there can appear a cross-over region sandwiched by two critical points in the intermediate temperature ($T$) region, while the phase transition in the low-$T$ region including zero temperature keeps being first order until the strength of the anomaly term is increased to have a critical value. On the other hand, when the vector coupling is also present, there appears a crossover region in the low-$T$ area including zero temperature with a new critical point, as was first demonstrated by Kitazawa et al and the present authors without and with the charge-neutral condition, respectively. We remark that the possible chromomagnetic instability is suppressed and can be even completely absent owing to the enhanced diquark coupling due to the anomaly term and/or by the vector interaction.","We discuss constraints imposed on the zero-recoil curvature and higher derivatives of the Isgur-Wise function by a general quark model. These constraints are expressed as bounds for a given slope parameter, and compared with those based upon analyticity properties of QCD spectral functions.

Scalar Absorption and the Breaking of the World Volume Conformal Invariance,Azimuthally-correlated contributions to QCD transverse-momentum resummation at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\rm S}^2)$,True,We investigate a version of fixed scalars for non-dilatonic branes which correspond to dilatations of the brane world-volume. We obtain a cross-section whose world-volume interpretation falls out naturally from an investigation of the breaking of conformal invariance by the irrelevant Born-Infeld corrections to Yang-Mills theory. From the same irrelevant world-volume operator we obtain the leading correction to the cross-sections of minimal scalars. This correction can be obtained in supergravity via an improved matching of inner and outer solutions to the minimal wave equation.,"Singular factors originating from the QCD factorisation of scattering amplitudes in soft and collinear limits play a prominent role in both organising and computing high-order perturbative contributions to hard-scattering cross sections. In this talk, we start from the factorisation structure of scattering amplitudes in the collinear limit, and we introduce collinear functions that have a process-independent structure. These collinear functions, which are defined at the fully-differential level, can then be integrated over the appropriate observable-dependent phase space to compute logarithmically-enhanced contributions to the corresponding observable. For transverse-momentum dependent observables, we show how the collinear functions can be defined without introducing what is known as rapidity divergences in the literature.

We calculate $\eta$-mesic bound states in the nucleus using an optical potential and their formation cross section with the Green function method. Then, we carefully check the experimental feasibility. We find that $\eta$-mesic nuclei can be observed experimentally using the (d,$^3$He) reaction. We also mention the possibility to study the formation of $\omega$-mesic nuclei.","In this paper,a systematic study of quantum phase transition within U(5) \leftrightarrow SO(6) limits is presented in terms of infinite dimensional Algebraic technique in the IBM framework. Energy level statistics are investigated with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method in order to characterize transitional region. Eigenvalues of these systems are obtained by solving Bethe-Ansatz equations with least square fitting processes to experimental data to obtain constants of Hamiltonian. Our obtained results verify the dependence of Nearest Neighbor Spacing Distribution's (NNSD) parameter to control parameter (c_{s}) and also display chaotic behavior of transitional regions in comparing with both limits. In order to compare our results for two limits with both GUE and GOE ensembles, we have suggested a new NNSD distribution and have obtained better KLD distances for the new distribution in compared with others in both limits. Also in the case of N\to\infty, the total boson number dependence displays the universality behavior, namely NNSD tends to Poisson limit for every values of control parameter.",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

"A classical, non-singular, bouncing universe",Holographic Lifshitz flows and the null energy condition,True,"We present a model for a classical, non-singular bouncing cosmology without violation of the null energy condition (NEC). The field content is General Relativity plus a real scalar field with a canonical kinetic term and only renormalizable, polynomial type self-interaction for the scalar field in the Jordan frame. The universe begins vacuum-energy dominated and is contracting at $t=-\infty$. We consider a closed universe with a positive spatial curvature, which is responsible for the universe bouncing without any NEC violation. An $R\phi^2$ coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field drives the scalar from the initial false vacuum to the true vacuum during the bounce. The model is sub-Planckian throughout its evolution and every dimensionful parameter is below the effective field theory scale $M_P$, so we expect no ghost-type or tachyonic instabilities. This model solves the horizon problem and extends co-moving particle geodesics to past infinity, resulting in a geodesically complete universe without singularities. We solve the Friedman equations and the scalar field equation of motion numerically, and analytically under certain approximations.","We study asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes and the constraints on flows between Lifshitz fixed points imposed by the null energy condition. In contrast with the relativistic holographic c-theorem, where the effective AdS radius, L, is monotonically decreasing in the IR, for Lifshitz backgrounds we find that both L and z may flow in either direction. We demonstrate this with several numerical examples in a phenomenological model with a massive gauge field coupled to a real scalar.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Compact Binaries in Star Clusters I - Black Hole Binaries Inside Globular Clusters,Energy conversion rate of an active region transient brightening estimated by a spectroscopic observation of Hinode,True,"We study the compact binary population in star clusters, focusing on binaries containing black holes, using a self-consistent Monte Carlo treatment of dynamics and full stellar evolution. We find that the black holes experience strong mass segregation and become centrally concentrated. In the core the black holes interact strongly with each other and black hole-black hole binaries are formed very efficiently. The strong interactions, however, also destroy or eject the black hole-black hole binaries. We find no black hole-black hole mergers within our simulations but produce many hard escapers that will merge in the galactic field within a Hubble time. We also find several highly eccentric black hole-black hole binaries that are potential LISA sources, suggesting that star clusters are interesting targets for space-based detectors. We conclude that star clusters must be taken into account when predicting compact binary population statistics.","We statistically estimate the conversion rate of the energy released during an active-region transient brightening to Doppler motion and thermal and non-thermal energies. We used two types of datasets for the energy estimation and detection of transient brightenings. One includes spectroscopic images of Fe xiv, Fe xv, and Fe xvi lines observed by the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer. The other includes images obtained from the 211 \AA channel of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The observed active region was NOAA 11890 on November 09, 2013, and the day after that. As a result, the released Doppler motion and non-thermal energies were found to be approximately 0.1 \-- 1% and 10 \-- 100% of the change in the amount of thermal energy in each enhancement, respectively. Using this conversion rate, we estimated the contribution of the total energy flux of AIA transient brightenings to the active region heating to be at most 2% of the conduction and radiative losses.",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"Solar and stellar astrophysics focuses on white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variables.

Could bright gamma-ray burst optical transients have been recorded historically?,Serendipitous Science from the K2 Mission,True,"The brightest optical flash from a gamma-ray burst (GRB) was, briefly, a naked-eye object. Several other GRBs have produced optical transients only slightly fainter. We argue that, based upon the recently accumulated data from hundreds of GRB transients, many such optical events should have been visible to the unaided eye in the course of human history. The most likely repositories of such observations are historical records from the Orient, and we have located and discuss a number of candidates. We also consider the value of such observations, should any very likely ones be uncovered, to modern astrophysics.","The K2 mission is a repurposed use of the Kepler spacecraft to perform high-precision photometry of selected fields in the ecliptic. We have developed an aperture photometry pipeline for K2 data which performs dynamic automated aperture mask selection, background estimation and subtraction, and positional decorrelation to minimize the effects of spacecraft pointing jitter. We also identify secondary targets in the K2 ""postage stamps"" and produce light curves for those targets as well. Pipeline results will be made available to the community.

On the transition temperature(s) of magnetized two-flavour holographic QCD,Using quasar X-ray and UV flux measurements to constrain cosmological model parameters,True,"During heavy ion collisions, high temperatures and strong magnetic fields are generated. We employ the gauge-gravity duality to study the N_f=2 QCD phase diagram under these extreme conditions in the quenched approximation, in particular we use the non-antipodal Sakai-Sugimoto model (SSM). We take the different coupling of up and down flavours to the magnetic field into account geometrically, resulting in a split of the chiral phase transition according to flavour. We discuss the influence of the magnetic field on the chiral temperatures -in physical GeV units- in terms of the choice of the confinement scale in the model, extending hereby our elsewhere presented discussion of fixing the non-antipodal SSM parameters to the deconfinement phase. The flavour-dependent (T,L,eB) phase diagram, with variable asymptotic brane-antibrane separation L, is also presented, as a direct generalization of the known (T,L) phase diagram of the non-antipodal SSM at zero magnetic field. In particular, for sufficiently small L we are probing a NJL-like boundary field theory in which case we do find results very reminiscent of the predictions in NJL models.","Risaliti and Lusso have compiled X-ray and UV flux measurements of 1598 quasars (QSOs) in the redshift range $0.036 \leq z \leq 5.1003$, part of which, $z \sim 2.4 - 5.1$, is largely cosmologically unprobed. In this paper we use these QSO measurements, alone and in conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, to constrain cosmological parameters in six different cosmological models, each with two different Hubble constant priors. In most of these models, given the larger uncertainties, the QSO cosmological parameter constraints are mostly consistent with those from the $H(z)$ + BAO data. A somewhat significant exception is the non-relativistic matter density parameter $\Omega_{m0}$ where the QSO data favors $\Omega_{m0} \sim 0.5 - 0.6$ in most models. Consequently in joint analyses of QSO data with $H(z)$ + BAO data the one-dimensional $\Omega_{m0}$ distributions shift slightly toward larger values. A joint analysis of the QSO + $H(z)$ + BAO data is consistent with the current standard model, spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM, but mildly favors closed spatial hypersurfaces and dynamical dark energy. Since the higher $\Omega_{m0}$ values favored by the QSO data appear to be associated with the $z \sim 2 - 5$ part of these data, and conflict somewhat with strong indications for $\Omega_{m0} \sim 0.3$ from most $z < 2.5$ data as well as from the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data at $z \sim 1100$, in most models, the larger QSO data $\Omega_{m0}$ is possibly more indicative of an issue with the $z \sim 2 - 5$ QSO data than of an inadequacy of the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Astrophysical and theoretical physics implications from multimessenger neutron star observations,Directional correlations between UHECRs and neutrinos observed with IceCube,True,"The Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) recently measured the mass and equatorial radius of the isolated neutron star PSR J0030+0451. We use these measurements to infer the moment of inertia, the quadrupole moment, and the surface eccentricity of an isolated neutron star for the first time, using relations between these quantities that are insensitive to the unknown equation of state of supranuclear matter. We also use these results to forecast the moment of inertia of neutron star A in the double pulsar binary J0737-3039, a quantity anticipated to be directly measured in the coming decade with radio observations. Combining this information with the measurement of the tidal Love number with LIGO/Virgo observations, we propose and implement the first theory-agnostic and equation-of-state-insensitive test of general relativity. Specializing these constraints to a particular modified theory, we find that consistency with general relativity places the most stringent constraint on gravitational parity violation to date, surpassing all other previously reported bounds by seven orders of magnitude and opens the path for future a test of general relativity with multimessenger neutron star observations.","Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) above an energy threshold of tens of EeV might undergo only small deflections due to interstellar magnetic fields. Their arrival directions would then point to regions of possible hadronic acceleration processes, which are likely to be also sources of high energy neutrinos. To search for such cosmic accelerators, we present here the first high statistics analysis of directional correlations between neutrino candidates from the IceCube Observatory and UHECR events. Data taken with IceCube in a configuration of 22 strings provided the basis for using published events from both the Pierre Auger Observatory and the HiRes experiment as reference directions in a search for coincidences with neutrinos. The analysis was optimized according to strict blindness criteria and showed an excess of neutrino candidates close to UHECR directions with a probability of 1% to occur as a random fluctuation, consistent with a background-only hypothesis. An extension of this analysis to include newer IceCube data, taken with 40 strings and using a likelihood approach, is discussed in the outlook.",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"High energy astrophysical phenomena focuses on cosmic ray production, acceleration, propagation, detection.

Herschel PACS and SPIRE Observations of TWA brown dwarf discs,Stellar Polarimetry: Where Are We and Where Are We Going?,True,"We present Herschel SPIRE observations for the TW Hydrae association (TWA) brown dwarf discs SSSPM J1102-3431 (SS1102) and 2MASSW J1207334-393254 (2M1207). Both discs are undetected in the SPIRE 200-500mu bands. We have also analyzed the archival PACS data and find no detection for either source in the 160mu band. Based on radiative transfer modeling, we estimate an upper limit to the disc mass for both sources of 0.1 M_Jup. The lack of detection in the SPIRE bands could be due to a paucity of millimeter sized dust grains in the 2M1207 and SS1102 discs. We also report a non-detection for the brown dwarf 2MASS J1139511-315921 (2M1139) in the PACS 70 and 160mu bands. We have argued for the presence of a warm debris disc around 2M1139, based on an excess emission observed at 24mu. The mid-infrared colors for 2M1139 are similar to the transition discs in the Taurus and Ophuichus regions. A comparison of the brown dwarf disc masses over a ~1-10 Myr age interval suggests a decline in the disc mass with the age of the system.","On the final day of the Stellar Polarimetry conference, participants split up into three ""breakout sessions"" to discuss the future of the field in the areas of instrumentation, upcoming opportunities, and community priorities.

Some consequences of a Higgs triplet,Quark-gluon plasma phenomenology from anisotropic lattice QCD,True,"We consider an extension of the scalar sector of the Standard Model with a single complex Higgs triplet $X$. Such extensions are the most economic, model-independent way of generating neutrino masses through triplet interactions. We show that a term like $\azero\Phi\Phi X^\dag$ must be included in the most general potential of such a scenario, in order to avoid a massless neutral physical scalar. We also demonstrate that $\azero$ must be real, thus ruling out any additional source of CP-violation. We then examine the implications of this term in the mass matrices of the singly-and doubly-charged scalar, neutral scalar and pseudoscalar fields. We find that, for small values of $\azero/\vtwo$, where $\vtwo$ is the triplet vev, the spectrum allows the decay of heavier scalars into lighter ones via gauge interactions. For large $\azero/\vtwo$, the doubly-charged, singly-charged and neutral pseudoscalar bosons become practically degenerate, while the even-parity neutral scalars remain considerably lighter, thus emphasizing the possibility of decay of the singly-charged or neutral pseudoscalar states into the neutral scalars. Constraints from the $\rho$-parameter are used to find nontrivial limits on the charged Higgs mass depending on $\azero$. We also study the couplings of the various physical states in this scenario. For small values of $|\azero|/\vtwo$, we find the lightest neutral scalar field to be triplet-dominated, and thus having extremely suppressed interactions with fermion as well as gauge boson pairs.","The FASTSUM collaboration has been carrying out simulations of N_f=2+1 QCD at nonzero temperature in the fixed-scale approach using anisotropic lattices.

Full Electroresistance Modulation in a Mixed-Phase Metallic Alloy,Mode-selective vibrational control of charge transport in $\pi$-conjugated molecular materials,True,"We report a giant, ~22%, electroresistance modulation for a metallic alloy above room temperature. It is achieved by a small electric field of 2 kV/cm via piezoelectric strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling and the resulting magnetic phase transition in epitaxial FeRh/BaTiO3 heterostructures. This work presents detailed experimental evidence for an isothermal magnetic phase transition driven by tetragonality modulation in FeRh thin films, which is in contrast to the large volume expansion in the conventional temperature-driven magnetic phase transition in FeRh. Moreover, all the experimental results in this work illustrate FeRh as a mixed-phase model system well similar to phase-separated colossal magnetoresistance systems with phase instability therein.","The soft character of organic materials leads to strong coupling between molecular nuclear and electronic dynamics. This coupling opens the way to control charge transport in organic electronic devices by inducing molecular vibrational motions. However, despite encouraging theoretical predictions, experimental realization of such control has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate experimentally that photoconductivity in a model organic optoelectronic device can be controlled by the selective excitation of molecular vibrations. Using an ultrafast infrared laser source to create a coherent superposition of vibrational motions in a pentacene/C60 photoresistor, we observe that excitation of certain modes in the 1500-1700 cm$^{-1}$ region leads to photocurrent enhancement. Excited vibrations affect predominantly trapped carriers. The effect depends on the nature of the vibration and its mode-specific character can be well described by the vibrational modulation of intermolecular electronic couplings. Vibrational control thus presents a new tool for studying electron-phonon coupling and charge dynamics in (bio)molecular materials.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Proca in the sky,An Isolated HII Region near ESO 481-G017,True,"The standard model of cosmology, the $\Lambda$CDM model, describes the evolution of the Universe since the Big Bang with just a few parameters, six in its basic form. Despite being the simplest model, direct late-time measurements of the Hubble constant compared with the early-universe measurements result in the so-called $H_0$ tension. It is claimed that a late time resolution is predestined to fail when different cosmological probes are combined. In this work, we shake the ground of this belief with a very simple model. We show how, in the context of cubic vector Galileon models, the Hubble tension can naturally be relieved using a combination of CMB, BAO and SNe observations without using any prior on $H_0$ . The tension can be reduced even further by including the local measurement of the Hubble constant.",We obtained VLA 21-cm observations of the galaxy ESO 481-G017 to determine the environment and trigger of remote star formation traced by a HII region found 43 kpc from the galaxy (in projection).

A Return To Neutrino Normalcy,Compositeness Condition and Vacuum Stability,True,Understanding the structure of the fermion mixing matrices is an important question in particle physics. The quark mixing matrix is approximately diagonal while the lepton mixing matrix has large off-diagonal elements. Attempting to understand these structures has been the focus of an large body of literature over the last several decades. In this article we propose a new set of conditions to test the structure of mass matrices called normalcy based on how close to diagonal the mixing matrix is. The mass ordering and the octant of $\theta_{23}$ represent two of these conditions. We point out that the quark matrix easily satisfies all six normalcy conditions while none of them are known to be fully satisfied for leptons at high significance. All of the conditions that can be tested for leptons suggest that the matrix could satisfy the normalcy conditions and upcoming experiments such as DUNE and T2HK will most likely determine if the lepton mass matrix satisfies all of them or not.,"We consider what occurs when we remove one of the compositeness conditions proposed by Bardeen, Hill and Lindner that leads to predictions for the top quark mass conflicting with the experimental value. Through this consideration the condition for the Higgs particle to be the composite particle is reconsidered. We show that in this case, (I) the Higgs-Yukawa system of the standard model becomes equivalent to a non-local four-fermi system at a high-energy scale $\Lambda$, (II) The Higgs-Yukawa sector of the model becomes useless above the scale because the vacuum state cannot be defined. We regard the two phenomena as indications of the compositeness of the Higgs particle.

Bounds on quantum confinement effects in metal nanoparticles,Effects of phosphorus-doping upon the electronic structures of single wall carbon nanotubes,True,"Quantum size effects on the permittivity of metal nanoparticles are investigated using the quantum box model. Explicit upper and lower bounds are derived for the permittivity and relaxation rates due to quantum confinement effects. These bounds are verified numerically, and the size-dependence and frequency-dependence of the empirical Drude size parameter is extracted from the model. Results suggest that the common practice of empirically modifying the dielectric function can lead to inaccurate predictions for highly uniform distributions of finite-sized particles.","The phosphorus-doped single wall carbon nanotube (PSWCNT) is studied by using First-Principle methods based on Density Function Theory (DFT). The formation energy, total energy, band structure, geometry structure and density of states are calculated. It is found that the formation energy of the P-doped single carbon nanotubes increases with diameters; the total energy of carbon nanotubes with the same diameter decreases as the doping rate increases. The effects of impurity position on the im-purity level are discussed. It illustrates that the position of the impurity level may depend on the C-P-C bond angle.

A Young White Dwarf with an Infrared Excess,TESS Spots a Super-Puff: The Remarkably Low Density of TOI-1420b,True,"Using observations of Spitzer/IRAC, we report the serendipitous discovery of excess infrared emission from a single white dwarf PG 0010+280. At a temperature of 27,220 K and a cooling age of 16 Myr, it is the hottest and youngest white dwarf to display an excess at 3-8 $\mu$m. The infrared excess can be fit by either an opaque dust disk within the tidal radius of the white dwarf or a 1300 K blackbody, possibly from an irradiated substellar object or a re-heated giant planet. PG 0010+280 has two unique properties that are different from white dwarfs with a dust disk: (i) relatively low emission at 8 $\mu$m and (ii) non-detection of heavy elements in its atmosphere from high-resolution spectroscopic observations with Keck/HIRES. The origin of the infrared excess remains unclear.","We present the discovery of TOI-1420b, an exceptionally low-density ($\rho = 0.08\pm0.02$ g cm$^{-3}$) transiting planet in a $P = 6.96$ day orbit around a late G dwarf star. Using transit observations from TESS, LCOGT, OPM, Whitin, Wendelstein, OAUV, Ca l'Ou, and KeplerCam along with radial velocity observations from HARPS-N and NEID, we find that the planet has a radius of $R_p$ = 11.9 $\pm$ 0.3 $R_\Earth$ and a mass of $M_p$ = 25.1 $\pm$ 3.8 $M_\Earth$. TOI-1420b is the largest-known planet with a mass less than $50M_\Earth$, indicating that it contains a sizeable envelope of hydrogen and helium. We determine TOI-1420b's envelope mass fraction to be $f_{env} = 82^{+7}_{-6}\%$, suggesting that runaway gas accretion occurred when its core was at most $4-5\times$ the mass of the Earth. TOI-1420b is similar to the planet WASP-107b in mass, radius, density, and orbital period, so a comparison of these two systems may help reveal the origins of close-in low-density planets.

Small Fermi energy and phonon anharmonicity in MgB_2 and related compounds,"Formation Energy, Stress, and Relaxations of Low-Index Rhodium Surfaces",True,"The remarkable anharmonicity of the E_{2g} phonon in MgB_2 has been suggested in literature to play a primary role in its superconducting pairing. We investigate, by means of LDA calculations, the microscopic origin of such an anharmonicity in MgB_2, AlB_2, and in hole-doped graphite. We find that the anharmonic character of the E_{2g} phonon is essentially driven by the small Fermi energy of the sigma holes. We present a simple analytic model which allows us to understand in microscopic terms the role of the small Fermi energy and of the electronic structure. The relation between anharmonicity and nonadiabaticity is pointed out and discussed in relation to various materials.","Ab initio local-density-functional-theory calculations of formation energies, surface stress, and multilayer relaxations are reported for the (111), (100), and (110) surfaces of Rh.

Spin and pseudospin towers of the Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice,Magnon-phonon coupling effects on the indirect K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectrum of a 2D Heisenberg antiferromagnet,True,"In 1989, Lieb proved two theorems about the Hubbard model. One showed that the ground state of the attractive model was a spin singlet state ($S=0$), was unique, and was positive definite. The other showed that the ground state of the repulsive model on a bipartite lattice at half-filling has a total spin given by $|(N_A-N_B)/2|$, corresponding to the difference of the number of lattice sites on the two sublattices divided by two. In the mid to late 1990's, Shen extended these proofs to show that the pseudospin of the attractive model was minimal until the electron number equaled $2N_A$ where it became fixed at $J=|(N_A-N_B)/2|$ until the filling became $2N_B$, where it became minimal again. In addition, Shen showed that a spin tower exists for the spin eigenstates for the half-filled case on a bipartite lattice. The spin tower says the minimal energy state with spin $S$ is higher in energy than the minimal energy state with spin $S-1$ until we reach the ground-state spin given above. One long standing conjecture about this model remains, namely does the attractive model have such a spin tower for all fillings, which would then imply that the repulsive model has minimal pseudopsin in its ground state. While we do not prove this last conjecture, we provide a quick review of this previous work, provide a constructive proof of the pseudospin of the attractive model ground state, and describe the challenges with proving the remaining open conjecture.","We compute the effects of magnon-phonon coupling on the indirect K-edge bimagnon resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) intensity spectrum of a square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We analyze the effects of competing nearest and next--nearest magnetic and magnon-phonon coupling interaction in the RIXS spectrum, for both the antiferromagnetic (AF) and the collinear antiferromagnetic (CAF) phases of the model. Utilizing the Dyson-Maleev representation of spin operators, the Bethe-Salpeter ladder approximation scheme for the bimagnon interacting channel, and considering the lowest order magnon-phonon-magnon scattering interaction we highlight distinct features in the X-ray spectrum. Considering damping effects, arising due to the presence of phonons, we find that in the AF phase the RIXS intensity spectrum attains a maximum value primarily localized around the K $\left(\pm\frac{\pi}{2}, \pm \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ - point. For the CAF phase the intensity is broadly distributed with a significant scattering intensity located around the Y $\left(\pm\frac{\pi}{2}, 0\right)$ - point. Furthermore, in the CAF phase for suitable anisotropy, nearest-, and next-nearest neighbor interaction parameters the phonon effects can manifest itself as a distinct peak both below and above the bimagnon peak. Such a feature is in contrast to the antiferromagnetic spectrum where the effect due to the phonon peak was located consistently beyond the bimagnon peak in the high energy end of the spectrum. Additionally, in the CAF phase we find the RIXS bimagnon-phonon spectrum to be more sensitive to anisotropy compared to its antiferromagnetic counterpart. We conclude that the ultimate effect of magnon-phonon effects in the indirect K-edge RIXS spectrum, in both the antiferromagnetic and the collinear antiferromagnetic phase, is an observable effect.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Fully heavy pentaquarks,Observation of B+ -> proton Lambdabar gamma,True,"Very recently, the LHCb Collaboration reported a fully charmed tetraquark state $X(6900)$ in the invariant mass spectrum of $J/\psi$ pairs. If one $J/\psi$ meson is replaced with a fully charmed baryon, we obtain a fully charmed pentaquark candidate. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the mass spectra of the S-wave fully heavy pentaquark $QQQQ\bar{Q}$ in the framework of the chromomagnetic interaction model. Based on our results in two different schemes, we further investigate the decay behaviors for them. We hope that our study will be helpful in searching for such types of exotic pentaquark states in experiments in the future.","We report the first observation of the radiative hyperonic B decay B+ -> proton Lambdabar gamma, using a 140 fb-1 data sample recorded on the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+e- collider. The measured branching fraction is B(B+ -> proton Lambdabar gamma) = (2.16 ^{+0.58}_{-0.53} +- 0.20) times 10^{-6}. A search for B+ -> proton Sigmabar gamma yields no significant signal, so we set a 90% confidence-level upper limit on the branching fraction of B(B+ -> proton Sigmabar gamma) < 3.3 times 10^{-6}.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Emergence of a confined state in a weakly bent wire,Coexistence of electron whispering-gallery modes and atomic collapse states in graphene WSe2 heterostructure quantum dots,True,"In this paper we use a simple straightforward technique to investigate the emergence of a bound state in a weakly bent wire. We show that the bend behaves like an infinitely shallow potential well, and in the limit of small bending angle and low energy the bend can be presented by a simple 1D delta function potential.","The relativistic massless charge carriers with a Fermi velocity of about c300 in graphene enable us to realize two distinct types of resonances (c, the speed of light in vacuum). One is electron whispering-gallery mode in graphene quantum dots arising from the Klein tunneling of the massless Dirac fermions. The other is atomic collapse state, which has never been observed in experiment with real atoms due to the difficulty of producing heavy nuclei with charge Z 170, however, can be realized near a Coulomb impurity in graphene with a charge Z 1 because of the small velocity of the Dirac excitations. Here, unexpectedly, we demonstrate that both the electron whispering-gallery modes and atomic collapse states coexist in grapheneWSe2 heterostructure quantum dots due to the Coulomb-like potential near their edges. By applying a perpendicular magnetic field, evolution from the atomic collapse states to unusual Landau levels in the collapse regime are explored for the first time.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

A glimpse of a Luttinger liquid,Interedge spin resonance in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid,True,"The concept of a Luttinger liquid has recently been established as a fundamental paradigm vital to our understanding of the properties of one-dimensional quantum systems, leading to a number of theoretical breakthroughs. Now theoretical predictions have been put to test by the comprehensive experimental study.","The Kitaev model offers a platform for quantum spin liquids (QSLs) with fractional excitations, itinerant Majorana fermions and localized fluxes. Since these fractional excitations could be utilized for quantum computing, how to create, observe, and control them through the spin degree of freedom is a central issue. Here, we study dynamical spin transport in a wide range of frequency for the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, by applying an AC magnetic field to an edge of the system. We find that, in the Kitaev QSL phase, spin polarizations at the other edge are resonantly induced in a specific spin component, even though the static spin correlations are vanishingly small. This interedge spin resonance appears around the input frequency over the broad frequency range. Comparing with the dynamical spin correlations, we clarify that the resonance is governed by the itinerant Majorana fermions with a broad continuum excitation spectrum, which can propagate over long distances, although it vanishes for the pure Kitaev model because of accidental degeneracy and requires weak Heisenberg interactions. We also find that the spin polarizations in the other spin components are weakly induced at an almost constant frequency close to the excitation gap of the localized fluxes, irrespective of the input frequency. These results demonstrate that the dynamical spin transport is a powerful probe of the fractional excitations in the Kitaev QSL. Possible experimental realization of the interedge spin resonance is discussed.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Cooling of a $\Lambda$-type three-level atom in a high finesse optical cavity,Non-adiabatic transitions through exceptional points in the band structure of a PT-symmetric lattice,True,"A theoretical study is carried out for the cavity cooling of a $\Lambda$-type three level atom in a high-finesse optical cavity with a weakly driven field. Analytical expressions for the friction, diffusion coefficients and the equilibrium temperatures are obtained by using the Heisenberg equations, then they are calculated numerically and shown graphically as a function of controlling parameters. For a suitable choice of these parameters, the dynamics of the cavity field interaction with the $\Lambda$-type three-level atom introduces a sisyphus cooling mechanism yielding lower temperatures below the Doppler limit and allowing larger cooling rate, avoiding the problems induced by spontaneous emission.","Exceptional points, at which two or more eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian coalesce, occur in non-Hermitian systems and lead to surprising physical effects. In particular, the behaviour of a system under parameter variation can differ significantly from the familiar Hermitian case in the presence of exceptional points. Here we analytically derive the probability of a non-adiabatic transition in a two-level system driven through two consecutive exceptional points at finite speed. The system is Hermitian far away from the exceptional points. In the adiabatic limit an equal redistribution between the states coalescing in the exceptional point is observed, which can be interpreted as a loss of information when passing through the exceptional point. For finite parameter variation this gets modified. We demonstrate how the transition through the exceptional points can be experimentally addressed in a PT-symmetric lattice using Bloch oscillations.",Optics,Optics in physics focuses on adaptive optics.

Mining Application-aware Community Organization with Expanded Feature Subspaces from Concerned Attributes in Social Networks,Polarization in the three-state $q$-voter model with anticonformity and bounded confidence,True,"Social networks are typical attributed networks with node attributes. Different from traditional attribute community detection problem aiming at obtaining the whole set of communities in the network, we study an application-oriented problem of mining an application-aware community organization with respect to specific concerned attributes. The concerned attributes are designated based on the requirements of any application by a user in advance. The application-aware community organization w.r.t. concerned attributes consists of the communities with feature subspaces containing these concerned attributes. Besides concerned attributes, feature subspace of each required community may contain some other relevant attributes. All relevant attributes of a feature subspace jointly describe and determine the community embedded in such subspace. Thus the problem includes two subproblems, i.e., how to expand the set of concerned attributes to complete feature subspaces and how to mine the communities embedded in the expanded subspaces. Two subproblems are jointly solved by optimizing a quality function called subspace fitness. An algorithm called ACM is proposed. In order to locate the communities potentially belonging to the application-aware community organization, cohesive parts of a network backbone composed of nodes with similar concerned attributes are detected and set as the community seeds. The set of concerned attributes is set as the initial subspace for all community seeds. Then each community seed and its attribute subspace are adjusted iteratively to optimize the subspace fitness. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method and applications on real-world networks show its application values.","Engaging with dissenting views, fostering productive disagreements or strategic anticonformity can benefit organizations as it challenges the status quo. The question arises, however, whether such strategic anticonformity ultimately leads to social polarization, which is not a desirable phenomenon. We address this question within an agent-based model of discrete choices. Using the way of modeling social responses in continuous opinion models, we propose a three-state $q$-voter model with anticonformity and bounded confidence. We analyze the model on a complete graph using the mean-field approach and Monte Carlo simulations. We show that strong polarization appears only for a small probability of anticonformity, which means that conformity combined with homophily enhances polarization. Our findings agree with results obtained previously in the group discussion experiment and within various continuous opinion models.",Physics and Society,"Physics and society focuses on structure, dynamics and collective behavior of societies and groups (human or otherwise).

"Reply to Comment on ""Reevaluation of the parton distribution of strange quarks in the nucleon""",A non-vanishing neutrino mass and the strong CP problem: A new solution from the perspective of the EW-$\nu_R$ model,True,"A Comment on the recently published reevaluation of the polarization-averaged parton distribution of strange quarks in the nucleon using final data on the multiplicities of charged kaons in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering is reviewed. Important features of the comparison of one-dimensional projections of the multidimensional HERMES data are pointed out. A test of the leading-order extraction of xS(x) using the difference between charged-kaon multiplicities is repeated. The results are consistent with leading-order predictions within the uncertainties in the input data, and do not invalidate the earlier extraction of xS(x).","The EW-$\nu_R$ model was constructed to provide a scenario in which right-handed neutrinos are non-sterile and have masses proportional to the electroweak scale, providing an opportunity to test the seesaw mechanism at the LHC. What was hidden in the model until recently is the chiral symmetry which helps solve the strong CP problem by using it to rotate $\theta_{QCD}$ to zero. It turns out the contribution from the electroweak sector to the effective $\bar{\theta}$ is proportional to the light neutrino masses and is naturally small, satisfying the constraint coming from the present absence of the neutron electric dipole moment, and without the need for an axion.

Gas Bubbles Emerging from a Submerged Granular Bed,Dynamical Origins for Non-Gaussian Vorticity Distributions in Turbulent Flows,True,"This fluid dynamics video was submitted to the Gallery of Fluid Motion for the 2009 APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In this video we show some results from a simple experiment where air was injected by a single nozzle at known constant flow rates in the bottom of a granular bed submerged in water. The injected air propagates through the granular bed in one of two modes. Mode 1 emergence involves small discrete bubbles taking tortuous paths through the interstitial space of the bed. Multiple small bubbles can be emitted from the bed in an array of locations at the same time during Mode 1 emergence. Mode 2 emergence involves large discrete bubbles locally fluidizing the granular bed and exiting the bed approximately above the injection site. Bead diameter, bead density, and air flow rate were varied to investigate the change in bubble release behavior at the top of the granular bed. This system is a useful model for methane seeps in lakes. Methane bubbles are released from the decomposition of organic matter in the lake bed. The initial size of the bubble determines how much of the gas is absorbed into the lake and how much of the gas reaches the surface and is released into the atmosphere. The size and behavior of the emerging bubbles may also affect the amount of vertical mixing occurring in the lake, as well as the mixing from the lake bed into the benthic layer.",We present results on the connection between the vorticity equation and the shape of the single-point vorticity PDF.

"Influence de l'\'{e}lasticit\'{e} des lignes d'arbres, des roulements et du carter sur les vitesses critiques de rotation d'une transmission par engrenages",Brittle fracture in a periodic structure with internal potential energy. Quasi-static analysis,True,"The dynamic behaviour of a gearbox fitted out with a helical gear pair is studied. Shafts, bearings and housing are discretised using the finite element method. The elastic coupling between the toothed wheels is characterised by a 12x12 stiffness matrix. The calculation of the vibration response induced by the static transmission error shows that the highest dynamic mesh forces correspond to a resonant excitation of modes which have a high mesh stiffness energy. The numerical simulations show that a realistic prediction of the critical rotational speeds should take account of all the components of the gearbox.","We consider a linearly elastic body consisting of two equal symmetrically arranged layers (or half-planes) connected by a structured interface as a prospective crack path. The interface is comprised by periodic discrete system of bonds. In the initial state with no external forces, the bonds are assumed to be stressed in such a way that tensile and compressive forces of the same value alternate. In the general considerations, the layers are assumed to be of a general, unspecified {\em periodic} structure, where such self-equilibrated residual stresses can also exist. A two-line chain and an anisotropic lattice are examined as illustrative examples. We consider the states of the body-with-a-crack under the residual stresses and under a combined action of the remote forces and residual stresses. Analytical solutions to the considered problems are presented. The solutions are based on a selective discrete transform introduced. In particular, it is found that a formula for local-to-global energy release ratio, written in terms of the Wiener-Hopf equation kernel, is very general. We show that the residual stresses can manifest themselves in a number of phenomena such as the crack bridging, `porous' in front of the crack and crack growth irregularities. We also demonstrate analytically and graphically that the residual stresses can result in increase as well as in decrease of the crack resistance depending on the internal energy level.

The Star Formation Histories of Local Group Dwarf Galaxies II. Searching For Signatures of Reionization,Formation and Abundance of Late Forming Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter,True,"We search for signatures of reionization in the star formation histories (SFHs) of 38 Local Group dwarf galaxies (10$^4$ $<$ M$_{\star}$ $<$ 10$^9$ M$_{\odot}$). The SFHs are derived from color-magnitude diagrams using archival Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 imaging. Only five quenched galaxies (And V, And VI, And XIII, Leo IV, Hercules) are consistent with forming the bulk of their stars before reionization, when full uncertainties are considered. Observations of 13 of the predicted `true fossils' identified by Bovill & Ricotti show that only two (Hercules and Leo IV) indicate star formation quenched by reionization. However, both are within the virial radius of the Milky Way and evidence of tidal disturbance complicates this interpretation. We argue that the late-time gas capture scenario posited by Ricotti for the low mass, gas-rich, and star-forming fossil candidate Leo T is observationally indistinguishable from simple gas retention. Given the ambiguity between environmental effects and reionization, the best reionization fossil candidates are quenched low mass field galaxies (e.g., KKR 25).","We propose a novel mechanism where Primordial Black Hole (PBH) dark matter is formed much later in the history of the universe between the epoch of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon decoupling. In our setup, one does not need to modify the scale-invariant inflationary power spectra; instead, a late phase transition in strongly interacting fermion-scalar fluid (which naturally occurs around red-shift $ 10^6 \leq \, z_{\scriptscriptstyle T} \, \leq 10^8$ ) creates an instability in the density perturbation as sound speed turns imaginary. As a result, the dark matter perturbation grows exponentially in sub-Compton scales. This follows the immediate formation of early dense dark matter halo, which finally evolves into PBH due to cooling through scalar radiation. We calculate the variance of the density perturbations and PBH fractional abundances $f(M)$ by using a non-monochromatic mass function. We find the peak of our PBH mass function lies between $10^{-16} - 10^{-14}$ solar mass for $ z_{\scriptscriptstyle T} \simeq 10^6$, and thus it can be the entire dark matter of the universe. In PBH formation, one would expect a temporary phase where an attractive scalar balances the Fermi pressure. We numerically confirm that such a state indeed exists, and we find the radius and density profile of the temporary static structure of the dark matter halo, which finally evolves to PBH due to cooling through scalar radiation.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Kerr nonlinearity effect on light transmission in one dimensional photonic crystal,First principles design of Ohmic spin diodes based on quaternary Heusler compounds,True,"We investigate numerically the effect of Kerr nonlinearity on the transmission spectrum of a one dimensional $\delta$-function photonic crystal. It is found that the photonic band gap (PBG) width either increases or decreases depending on both sign and strength of Kerr nonlinearity. We found that any amount of self-focusing nonlinearity $(\alpha >0)$ leads to an increase of the PBG width leading to light localization. However, for defocusing nonlinearity, we found a range of non-linearity strengths for which the photonic band gap width decreases when the nonlinearity strength increases and a critical non-linearity strength $|\alpha_{c}|$ above which the behaviour is reversed. At this critical value the photonic crystal become transparent and the photonic band gap is suppressed. We have also studied the dependence on the angle of incidence and polarization in the transmission spectrum of our one-dimensional photonic crystal. We found that the minimum of the transmission increases with incident angle but seems to be polarization-independent. We also found that position of the photonic band gap (PBG) shifts to lower wavelengths when the angle of incidence increases for TE mode while it shifts to longer wavelengths for TM mode.","The Ohmic spin diode (OSD) is a recent concept in spintronics, which is based on half-metallic magnets (HMMs) and spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs). Quaternary Heusler compounds offer a unique platform to realize the OSD for room temperature applications as these materials possess very high Curie temperatures as well as half-metallic and spin-gapless semiconducting behavior within the same family. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function method we design four different OSDs based on half-metallic and spin-gapless semiconducting quaternary Heusler compounds. All four OSDs exhibit linear current-voltage ($I-V$) characteristics with zero threshold voltage $V_T$. We show that these OSDs possess a small leakage current, which stems from the overlap of the conduction and valence band edges of opposite spin channels around the Fermi level in the SGS electrodes. The obtained on/off current ratios vary between $30$ and $10^5$. Our results can pave the way for the experimental fabrication of the OSDs within the family of ordered quaternary Heusler compounds.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Simulating solvation and acidity in complex mixtures with first-principles accuracy: the case of CH$_3$SO$_3$H and H$_2$O$_2$ in phenol,Role of enviromental dynamic polarizability in static excited state properties of embedded molecular systems: Application to disordered fluorographene systems,True,"We present a generally-applicable computational framework for the efficient and accurate characterization of molecular structural patterns and acid properties in explicit solvent using H$_2$O$_2$ and CH$_3$SO$_3$H in phenol as an example. In order to address the challenges posed by the complexity of the problem, we resort to a set of data-driven methods and enhanced sampling algorithms. The synergistic application of these techniques makes the first-principle estimation of the chemical properties feasible without renouncing to the use of explicit solvation, involving extensive statistical sampling. Ensembles of neural network potentials are trained on a set of configurations carefully selected out of preliminary simulations performed at a low-cost density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) level. The energy and forces of these configurations are then recomputed at the hybrid density functional theory (DFT) level and used to train the neural networks. The stability of the NN model is enhanced by using DFTB energetics as a baseline, but the efficiency of the direct NN (i.e., baseline-free) is exploited via a multiple-time step integrator. The neural network potentials are combined with enhanced sampling techniques, such as replica exchange and metadynamics, and used to characterize the relevant protonated species and dominant non-covalent interactions in the mixture, also considering nuclear quantum effects.","We present an extension of the standard polarizable quantum mechanic/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach for treating environmental effects on excited state properties of embedded systems. A quantum polarizable atom model is derived from a full quantum description of the environment using perturbation theory for the system-environment coupling. Our model provides a more general description of the environment, including frequency dependent atomic polarizabilities, without loss of computational simplicity of the QM/MM approach. The classical polarizable atom description used in polarizable QM/MM approach can be obtained as a limiting case of the present model. This enables us to pinpoint approximations and assumptions about the system inherent to classical polarizable atom description of the environment. We apply our method to fluorographene (FG) based systems to investigate effects of the FG sheet on excited state properties of impurities on the FG surface.

VERITAS long term monitoring of Gamma-Ray emission from the BL Lacertae object,Alfv\'en Polar Oscillations of Relativistic Stars,True,"BL Lacertae is the prototype of the blazar subclass known as BL Lac type objects. BL Lacertae object itself is a low-frequency-peaked BL Lac(LBL). Very high energy (VHE) gamma ray emission from this source was discovered in 2005 by MAGIC observatory while the source was at a flaring state. Since then, VHE gamma rays from this source has been detected several times. However, all of those times the source was in a high activity state. Former studies suggest several non-thermal zones emitting in gamma-rays, then gamma-ray flare should be composed of a convolution. Observing the BL Lacertae object at quiescent states and active states is the key to disentangle these two components. VERITAS is monitoring the BL Lacertae object since 2011.

Critical Temperature and Condensate Fraction of a Fermion Pair Condensate,Quantum Many-Body Phenomena in Coupled Cavity Arrays,True,We report on measurements of the critical temperature and the temperature dependence of the condensate fraction for a fermion pair condensate of 6Li atoms. The Bragg spectroscopy is employed to determine the critical temperature and the condensate fraction after a fast magnetic field ramp to the molecular side of the Feshbach resonance. Our measurements reveal the level-off of the critical temperature and the limiting behavior of condensate fraction near the unitarity limit.,"The increasing level of experimental control over atomic and optical systems gained in the past years have paved the way for the exploration of new physical regimes in quantum optics and atomic physics, characterised by the appearance of quantum many-body phenomena, originally encountered only in condensed-matter physics, and the possibility of experimentally accessing them in a more controlled manner. In this review article we survey recent theoretical studies concerning the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to create quantum many-body systems.

Foreground removal requirements for measuring large-scale CMB B-modes in light of BICEP2,Chemistry of heavy elements in the Dark Ages,True,"The most convincing confirmation that the B-mode polarization signal detected at degree scales by BICEP2 is due to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) would be the measurement of its large-scale counterpart. We assess the requirements for diffuse component separation accuracy over large portions of the sky in order to measure the large-scale B-mode signal corresponding to a tensor to scalar ratio of r=0.1-0.2. We use the method proposed by Bonaldi & Ricciardi (2011) to forecast the performances of different simulated experiments taking into account noise and foreground removal issues. We do not consider instrumental systematics, and we implicitly assume that they are not the dominant source of error. If this is the case, the confirmation of an r=0.1-0.2 signal is achievable by Planck even for conservative assumptions regarding the accuracy of foreground cleaning. Our forecasts suggest that the combination of this experiment with BICEP2 will lead to an improvement of 25-45% in the constraint on r. A next-generation CMB polarization satellite, represented in this work by the COrE experiment, can reduce dramatically (by almost another order of magnitude) the uncertainty on r. In this case, however, the accuracy of foreground removal becomes critical to fully benefit from the increase in sensitivity.","Primordial molecules were formed during the Dark Ages, i.e. the time between recombination and reionization in the early Universe. The purpose of this article is to analyze the formation of primordial molecules based on heavy elements during the Dark Ages, with elemental abundances taken from different nucleosynthesis models. We present calculations of the full non-linear equation set governing the primordial chemistry. We consider the evolution of 45 chemical species and use an implicit multistep method of variable order of precision with an adaptive stepsize control. We find that the most abundant Dark Ages molecules based on heavy elements are CH and OH. Non-standard nucleosynthesis can lead to higher heavy element abundances while still satisfying the observed primordial light abundances. In that case, we show that the abundances of molecular species based on C, N, O and F can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case, leading to a CH relative abundance higher than that of HD+ or H2D+.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Q-Deformed Bi-Local Fields,Thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz analysis in an SU(2)xU(1) symmetric sigma-model,True,"We study the q-deformation of the bi-local system, two particle system, bounded by a relativistic harmonic oscillator type of potential from both points of view of mass spectra and the behavior of scattering amplitudes. In particular, we try to formulate the deformation so that $P^2$, the square of center of mass momenta, enters into the deformation parameters of relative coordinates. As a result, the wave equation of the bi-local system becomes non-linear one with respect to $P^2$; then, the propagator of the bi-local system suffers significant change so as to get a convergent self energy to second order.","Four different types of free energies are computed by both thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz (TBA) techniques and by weak coupling perturbation theory in an integrable one-parameter deformation of the O(4) principal chiral sigma-model (with SU(2)xU(1) symmetry). The model exhibits both `fermionic' and `bosonic' type free energies and in all cases the perturbative and the TBA results are in perfect agreement, strongly supporting the correctness of the proposed S matrix.

Light neutrino propagation in matter without heavy neutrino decoupling,On the radiative decays of light vector and axial-vector mesons,True,"We review the propagation of light neutrinos in matter assuming that their mixing with heavy neutrinos is close to present experimental limits. The phenomenological implications of the non-unitarity of the light neutrino mixing matrix for neutrino oscillations are discussed. In particular we show that the resonance effect in neutrino propagation in matter persists, but for slightly modified values of the parameters and with the maximum reduced by a small amount proportional to the mixing between light and heavy neutrinos squared.","We study the light vector and axial-vector mesons. According to the hadrogenesis conjecture the nature of the two types of states is distinct. The axial-vector mesons are generated dynamically by coupled-channel interactions based on the chiral Lagrangian written down in terms of the Goldstone bosons and the light vector mesons. We propose a novel counting scheme that arises if the chiral Lagrangian is supplemented by constraints from large-N_c QCD in the context of the hadrogenesis conjecture. The counting scheme is successfully tested by a systematic study of the properties of vector mesons. The spectrum of light axial-vector mesons is derived relying on the leading order interaction of the Goldstone bosons with the vector mesons supplemented by a phenomenology for correction terms. The f_1(1282), b_1(1230), h_1(1386), a_1(1230) and K_1(1272) mesons are recovered as molecular states. Based on those results the one-loop contributions to the electromagnetic decay amplitudes of axial-vector molecules into pseudo-scalar or vector mesons are evaluated systematically. In order to arrive at gauge invariant results in a transparent manner we choose to represent the vector particles by anti-symmetric tensor fields. It is emphasized that there are no tree-level contributions to a radiative decay amplitude of a given state if that state is generated by coupled-channel dynamics. The inclusion of the latter would be double counting. At present we restrict ourselves to loops where a vector and a pseudo-scalar meson couple to the axial-vector molecule. We argue that final and predictive results require further computations involving intermediate states with two vector mesons. The relevance of the latter is predicted by our counting rules.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Recent insights on the penumbra formation process,Dynamical Evolution of White Dwarfs in Triples in the Era of Gaia,True,"Using high-resolution spectropolarimetric data acquired by \textit{IBIS}, as well as \textit{SDO}/HMI observations, we studied the penumbra formation in AR NOAA 11490 and in a sample of twelve ARs appeared on the solar disk on 2011 and 2012, which were characterized by $\beta$-type magnetic field configuration. The results show that the onset of the classical Evershed flow occurs in a very short time scale, 1-3 hours. Studying the formation of the first penumbral sector around the following proto-spot, we found that a stable penumbra forms in the area facing the opposite polarity, which appears to be co-spatial with an AFS, i.e. in a flux emergence region, in contrast with the results of \cite{Schlichenmaier2010} concerning the leading polarity of AR NOAA 11490. Conversely, analyzing the sample of twelve ARs, we noticed that there is not a preferred location for the formation of the first penumbral sector. We also observed before the penumbra formation an inverse Evershed flow, which changes its sign when the penumbra appears. This confirms the observational evidence that the appearance of the penumbral filaments is correlated with the transition from the inverse Evershed to the classical Evershed flow. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that the time needed to form the penumbra may be related to the location where the penumbra first appears. New high-resolution observations, like those that will be provided by the European Solar Telescope, are expected to increase our understanding of the penumbra formation process.","The $Gaia$ mission has detected many white dwarfs (WDs) in binary and triple configurations, and while observations suggest that triple stellar systems are common in our Galaxy, not much attention was devoted to WDs in triples. For stability reasons, these triples must have hierarchical configurations, i.e., two stars are on a tight orbit (the inner binary), with the third companion on a wider orbit about the inner binary. In such a system, the two orbits torque each other via the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism (EKL), which can alter the orbital configuration of the inner binary. We simulate thousands of triple stellar systems for over $10$ Gyr, tracking gravitational interactions, tides, general relativity, and stellar evolution up to their WD fate. As demonstrated here, three-body dynamics coupled with stellar evolution is a critical channel to form tight WD binaries or merge a WD binary. Amongst these triples, we explore their manifestations as cataclysmic variables, Type Ia supernovae, and gravitational-wave events. The simulated systems are then compared to a sample of WD triples selected from the $Gaia$ catalog. We find that including the effect of mass loss-induced kicks is crucial for producing a distribution of the inner binary-tertiary separations that is consistent with $Gaia$ observations. Lastly, we leverage this consistency to estimate that, at minimum, $30\%$ of solar-type stars in the local $200$ parsecs were born in triples.",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"Solar and stellar astrophysics focuses on white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variables.

"The Pressure in 2, 2+1 and 3 Flavour QCD",Neutrino Masses and Leptonic CP Violation,True,"We calculate the pressure in QCD with two and three light quarks on a lattice of size 16^3x4 using tree level improved gauge and fermion actions. We argue that for temperatures T > 2T_c systematic effects due to the finite lattice cut-off and non-vanishing quark masses are below 15% in this calculation and give an estimate for the continuum extrapolated pressure in QCD with massless quarks. We find that the flavour dependence of the pressure is dominated by that of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Furthermore we perform a calculation of the pressure using 2 light (m_u,d/T=0.4) and one heavier quark (m_s/T = 1). In this case the pressure is reduced relative to that of three flavour QCD. This effect is stronger than expected from the mass dependence of an ideal Fermi gas.","Neutrino oscillations as solutions of the solar neutrino problems and the atmospheric neutrino deficits may restrict neutrino mass squared differences and mixing angles in three-neutrino mixing scheme. Currently we have several solutions depending on the interpretations of the solar neutrino problems. Combining the neutrino oscillation solutions and a mass matrix ansatz, we investigated the neutrino mass bounds and found possible leptonic CP-violating rephasing-invariant quantity $J^{l}_{\tiny CP} \leq 0.012$ for large mixing angle MSW and just-so vacuum oscillations solutions, and $J^{l}_{\tiny CP} \leq 0.0013$ for small mixing angle MSW solution.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Identification of Majorana Modes in Interacting Systems by Local Integrals of Motion,Spin-gapped incoherent metal with preformed pairing in the doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator,True,"Recently, there has been substantial progress in methods of identifying local integrals of motion in interacting integrable models or in systems with many-body localization. We show that one of these approaches can be utilized for constructing local, conserved, Majorana fermions in systems with an arbitrary many-body interaction. As a test case, we first investigate a non-interacting Kitaev model and demonstrate that this approach perfectly reproduces the standard results. Then, we discuss how the many-body interactions influence the spatial structure and the lifetime of the Majorana modes. Finally, we determine the regime for which the information stored in the Majorana correlators is also retained for arbitrarily long times at high temperatures. We show that it is included in the regime with topologically protected soft Majorana modes, but in some cases is significantly smaller.","We investigate how the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator evolves into the d-wave BCS superconductor through hole doping. Allowing spin fluctuations in the strong coupling approach, we find a spin-gapped incoherent metal with preformed pairing as an intermediate phase between the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator and d-wave superconductor. This non-Fermi liquid metal is identified with an infrared stable fixed point in the spin-decomposition gauge theory, analogous to the spin liquid insulator in the slave-boson gauge theory. We consider the single particle spectrum and dynamical spin susceptibility in the anomalous metallic phase, and discuss physical implications.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Highly variable young massive stars in ATLASGAL clumps,The Hamburg/ESO R-process Enhanced Star survey (HERES) VI. The Galactic Chemical Evolution of Silicon,True,"High-amplitude variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is usually associated with episodic accretion events. It has not been observed so far in massive YSOs. Here, the high-amplitude variable star sample of ContrerasPe\~{n}a et al.(2016) has been used to search for highly-variable($\Delta$K$\ge$1\,mag) sources coinciding with dense clumps mapped using the 850\mum continuum emission by the ATLASGAL survey. 18 variable sources are centred on the sub-mm clump peaks, and coincide ($<$1"") with a 24$\mu$m point or compact ($<$10"") source. 13 of these 18 sources can be fit by YSO models. The 13 variable YSOs(VYSO) have luminosities of $\sim$10$^3$ L$_{\odot}$, an average mass of 8 M$_{\odot}$ and a range of ages up to 10$^6$ yr. 11 of these 13 VYSOs are located in the midst of infrared dark clouds. 9 of the 13 sources have $\Delta$K$>$2 mag, significantly higher compared to the mean variability of the entire VVV sample. The light curves of these objects sampled between 2010-2015 display rising, declining, or quasi-periodic behaviour but no clear periodicity. Light-curve analysis using Plavchan method show that the most prominent phased signals have periods of a few hundred days. The nature and time-scale of variations found in 6.7 Ghz methanol maser emission (MME) in massive stars are similar to that of the VYSO light curves. We argue that the origin of the observed variability is episodic accretion. We suggest that the timescale of a few hundred days may represent the frequency at which a spiralling disk feeds dense gas to the young massive star.","We determined the silicon abundances of 253 metal-poor stars in the metallicity range $-4<\mathrm{[Fe/H]} <-1.5$, based on non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation calculations of neutral silicon and high-resolution spectra obtained with VLT-UT2/UVES. The $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ dependence of [Si/Fe] noticed in previous investigation is diminished in our abundance analysis due to the inclusion of NLTE effects. An increasing slope of [Si/Fe] towards decreasing metallicity is present in our results, in agreement with Galactic chemical evolution models. The small intrinsic scatter of [Si/Fe] in our sample may imply that these stars formed in a region where the yields of type II supernovae were mixed into a large volume, or that the formation of these stars was strongly clustered, even if the ISM was enriched by single SNa II in a small mixing volume. We identified two dwarfs with $\mathrm{[Si/Fe]}\sim +1.0$: HE 0131$-$3953, and HE 1430$-$1123. These main-sequence turnoff stars are also carbon-enhanced.

Constraints on scalar coupling to electromagnetism,The Interplay of Kinetic and Radiative Feedback in Galaxy Clusters,True,"We review a possible non-minimal coupling (dilatonic) of a scalar field (axion like particle) to electromagnetism, through experimental and observational constraints. Such a coupling is motivated from recent quasar spectrum observations that indicate a possible spatial and/or temporal variation of the fine-structure constant. We consider a dilatonic coupling of the form $B_F (\phi) = 1 + g\phi$. The strongest bound on the coupling parameter $g$ is derived from weak equivalence principle tests, which impose $g < 1.6 \times 10^{-17}GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is strong enough to rule out this class of models as a cause for an observable cosmological variation of the fine structure constant unless a chameleon mechanism is implemented. Also, we argue that a similar coupling occurs in chameleon cosmology, another candidate dark mater particle and we estimate the cosmological consequences by both effects. It should be clarified that this class of models is not necessarily ruled out in the presence of a chameleon mechanism which can freeze the dynamics of the scalar field in high density laboratory regions.","Recent observations provide evidence that some cool-core clusters (CCCs) host quasars in their brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Motivated by these findings we use 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with the code Enzo to explore the joint role of the kinetic and radiative feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in BCGs. We implement kinetic feedback as sub-relativistic plasma outflows and model radiative feedback using the ray-tracing radiative transfer or thermal energy injection. In our simulations the central SMBH transitions between the radiatively efficient and radiatively inefficient states on timescales of a few Gyr, as a function of its accretion rate. The timescale for this transition depends primarily on the fraction of power allocated to each feedback mode, and to a lesser degree on the overall feedback luminosity of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Specifically, we find that (a) kinetic feedback must be present at both low and high accretion rates in order to prevent the cooling catastrophe, and (b) its contribution likely accounts for > 10% of the total AGN feedback power, since below this threshold simulated BCGs tend to host radio-loud quasars most of the time, in apparent contrast with observations. We also find a positive correlation between the AGN feedback power and the mass of the cold gas filaments in the cluster core, indicating that observations of H$\alpha$ filaments can be used as a measure of AGN feedback.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Pulsar timing can constrain primordial black holes in the LIGO mass window,Tau Neutrino Decays and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,True,"The recent discovery of gravitational waves from merging black holes has generated interest in primordial black holes as a possible component of the dark matter. In this paper, we show that pulsar timing may soon have sufficient data to constrain $1$-$1000\,M_{\odot}$ primordial black holes via the non-detection of a third-order Shapiro time delay as the black holes move around the Galactic halo. We present the results of a Monte Carlo simulation which suggests that future data from known pulsars may be capable of constraining the PBH density more stringently than other existing methods in the mass range ~1-30$\,M_{\odot}$. We find that timing new pulsars discovered using the proposed Square Kilometre Array may constrain primordial black holes in this mass range to comprise less than ~1-10% of the dark matter.","We investigate the non-radiative decay during nucleosynthesis of a massive tau neutrino with mass 0.1 - 1 MeV into an electron neutrino and a scalar or pseudoscalar particle, $\phi$. The full Boltzmann equation is used and shown to give markedly different results than the usual non-relativistic formalism for relativistic or semi-relativistic neutrino decays. Indeed, the region we investigate is where the formalism that has previously been applied to solving this problem is expected to break down. We also compare the nucleosynthesis predictions from this scenario with results from the standard model and with some of the available observational determinations of the primordial abundances. It is found that for relativistic or semi-relativistic decays the helium abundance can be significantly lowered without changing other light element abundances. Since a problem with the standard model of Big Bang nucleosynthesis is that helium appears to be overproduced, a decay of the type we discuss can be a possible solution.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

"The $m$-$z$ relation for type Ia supernovae, locally inhomogeneous cosmological models, and the nature of dark matter",Constraining the anisotropy of the Universe with the X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars,True,"The $m$-$z$ relation for type Ia supernovae is one of the key pieces of evidence supporting the cosmological `concordance model' with $\lambda_0 \approx 0.7$ and $\Omega_0 \approx 0.3$. However, it is well known that the $m$-$z$ relation depends not only on $\lambda_0$ and $\Omega_0$ (with $H_0$ as a scale factor) but also on the density of matter along the line of sight, which is not necessarily the same as the large-scale density. I investigate to what extent the measurement of $\lambda_0$ and $\Omega_0$ depends on this density when it is characterized by the parameter $\eta$ ($0 \le \eta \le 1$), which describes the ratio of density along the line of sight to the overall density. I also discuss what constraints can be placed on $\eta$, both with and without constraints on $\lambda_0$ and $\Omega_0$ in addition to those from the $m$-$z$ relation for type~Ia supernovae.","We test the anisotropy in the Finslerian cosmological model with the X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) fluxes of 808 quasars. The dipole amplitude is $A_D=0.302_{ -0.124}^{ +0.185}$ and the dipole direction points towards $(l, b) = ( 288.92_{~ -28.80^{\circ}}^{^{\circ}+23.74^{\circ}}, 6.10_{~ -16.40^{\circ}}^{^{\circ} +16.55^{\circ}} )$. We find that the dipole direction from the X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars is very close to the dipole direction given by the ""Joint Light-curve Analysis"" (JLA) compilation in the Finslerian cosmological model and the angular difference between the two dipole directions is only $10.44^{\circ}$. We also find the angular difference between the dipole direction from the 808 quasars in the Finslerian cosmological model and ones from the supernovae of type Ia (SNe Ia) samples in the dipole-modulated $\Lambda$CDM model is around $30^{\circ}$. Six gravitationally lensed quasars are considered to investigate the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the Finslerian cosmological model. We get a slightly smaller $H_0$ than the result given by the six gravitationally lensed quasars. Finally, we forecast the future constraints on the dipole parameters with the X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars. As the number of simulations increases, the precisions of the parameters related to anisotropy in the Finslerian cosmological model improve significantly.

Isolating the chiral magnetic effect from backgrounds by pair invariant mass,"Beam energy dependence of cumulants of the net-baryon, net-charge and deuteron multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0-5.0$ GeV",True,"Topological gluon configurations in quantum chromodynamics induce quark chirality imbalance in local domains, which can result in the chiral magnetic effect (CME)--an electric charge separation along a strong magnetic field. Experimental searches for the CME in relativistic heavy ion collisions via the charge-dependent azimuthal correlator ($\Delta\gamma$) suffer from large backgrounds arising from particle correlations (e.g. due to resonance decays) coupled with the elliptic anisotropy. We propose differential measurements of the $\Delta\gamma$ as a function of the pair invariant mass ($m_{\rm inv}$), by restricting to high $m_{\rm inv}$ thus relatively background free, and by studying the $m_{\rm inv}$ dependence to separate the possible CME signal from backgrounds. We demonstrate by model studies the feasibility and effectiveness of such measurements for the CME search.","Within the ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model, in which the Lorentz-covariant treatment of nuclear mean-field potential is considered, the fluctuations of net-baryon, net-charge and deuterons multiplicity distributions in Au+Au head-on collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0-5.0$ GeV are calculated. The results show that the nuclear mean-field potential can significantly enhance the magnitude of baryon number fluctuations in narrow rapidity windows, and this enhancement rapidly weakens with increasing beam energy. However, for proton and net-charge number fluctuations, the mean-field effects are less noticeable than that for baryon number. In addition, for net-charge number fluctuations, the negative binomial distribution agrees well with the calculated results at mid-pseudorapidity window. Finally, the event-by-event fluctuations of deuteron number in the coalescence production picture are calculated as well, it is found that its cumulant ratios decrease linearly with increasing the average multiplicity of deuterons per event, i.e., increase with increasing beam energy.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

On the radiation energy density in the jet of high-energy emitting BL Lac objects and its impact on their multi-messenger role,Normal Type Ia supernovae from violent mergers of white dwarf binaries,True,"We examine the potential multi-messenger role of BL Lac objects emitting at high energy (so-called HBL) focusing on the limits on the energy density of soft radiation in the jet frame, a critical parameter which regulates the proton cooling and the fragmentation of ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei possibly accelerated in the jet. We show that (under the assumption that the high-energy emission bump is dominated by inverse Compton emission) the energy density of any external soft radiation field (e.g. produced by a layer surrounding the jet or in the accretion flow) cannot be larger than few times that associated to the observed synchrotron radiation produced in the emission region. Quite interestingly, the constraint that we derive is generally stronger than the limit obtained from the condition that the source is transparent to very-high energy $\gamma$-rays. Using this constraint we can derive a robust upper limit for the efficiency of the photopion reaction leading to the emission of PeV neutrinos, $f_{\pi}\lesssim 10^{-5}$, which makes HBL quite inefficient neutrino sources. For the photodisintegration of nuclei the results are more dependent on the spectral properties of the radiation field. The photodisintegration efficiency is safely below 1 (and nuclei can escape intact) for a `canonical' spectrum of the soft radiation field $\propto \nu^{-0.5}$. For radiation fields characterized by a softer spectrum and extended over a large portion of the jet, the efficiency increases and for an appreciable fraction of the sources nuclei with energies above $10^{19}$ eV might suffer significant photodisintegration.","One of the most important questions regarding the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is whether mergers of two white dwarfs can lead to explosions that reproduce observations of normal events. Here we present a fully three-dimensional simulation of a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with masses of $0.9 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $1.1 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ combining very high resolution and exact initial conditions. A well-tested combination of codes is used to study the system. We start with the dynamical inspiral phase and follow the subsequent thermonuclear explosion under the plausible assumption that a detonation forms in the process of merging. We then perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and radiative transfer simulations to predict synthetic observables from the homologously expanding supernova ejecta. We find that synthetic color lightcurves of our merger, which produces about $0.62 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, show good agreement with those observed for normal SNe Ia in all wave bands from U to K. Line velocities in synthetic spectra around maximum light also agree well with observations. We conclude, that violent mergers of massive white dwarfs can closely resemble normal SNe Ia.

Dynamical Interactions Make Hot Jupiters in Open Star Clusters,The SOPHIE search for northern extrasolar planets XIII. Two planets around M-dwarfs Gl617A and Gl96,True,"Explaining the origin and evolution of exoplanetary ""hot Jupiters"" remains a significant challenge. One possible mechanism for their production is planet-planet interactions, which produces hot Jupiters from planets born far from their host stars but near their dynamical stability limits. In the much more likely case of planets born far from their dynamical stability limits, can hot Jupiters can be formed in star clusters? Our N-body simulations of planetary systems inside star clusters answer this question in the affirmative, and show that hot Jupiter formation is not a rare event. We detail three case studies of the dynamics-induced births of hot Jupiters on highly eccentric orbits that can only occur inside star clusters. The hot Jupiters' orbits bear remarkable similarities to those of some of the most extreme exoplanets known: HAT-P-32 b, HAT-P-2 b, HD 80606 b and GJ 876 d. If stellar perturbations formed these hot Jupiters then our simulations predict that these very hot, inner planets are often accompanied by much more distant gas giants in highly eccentric orbits.","We report the detection of two exoplanets and a further tentative candidate around the M-dwarf stars Gl96 and Gl617A, based on radial velocity measurements obtained with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence.

Interpreting Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations with MillenniumTNG: Mass and environment scaling relations,From time to timescape - Einstein's unfinished revolution,True,"In the coming years, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) measurements can dramatically improve our understanding of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) and the role of feedback processes on galaxy formation, allowing us to calibrate important astrophysical systematics in cosmological constraints from weak lensing galaxy clustering surveys. However, the signal is only measured in a two-dimensional projection, and its correct interpretation relies on understanding the connection between observable quantities and the underlying intrinsic properties of the gas, in addition to the relation between the gas and the underlying matter distribution. One way to address these challenges is through the use of hydrodynamical simulations such as the high-resolution, large-volume MillenniumTNG suite. We find that measurements of the optical depth, $\tau$, and the Compton-y parameter, $Y$, receive large line-of-sight contributions which can be removed effectively by applying a Compensated Aperture Photometry (CAP) filter. In contrast with other $\tau$ probes (e.g., X-rays and Fast Radio Bursts), the kSZ-inferred $\tau$ receives most of its signal from a confined cylindrical region around the halo due to the velocity decorrelation along the line-of-sight. Additionally, we perform fits to the $Y-M$ and $\tau-M$ scaling relations and report best-fit parameters adopting the smoothly broken power law (SBPL) formalism. We note that subgrid physics modeling can broaden the error bar on these by 30\% for intermediate-mass halos ($\sim$$10^{13} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$). The scatter of the scaling relations can be captured by an intrinsic dependence on concentration, and an extrinsic dependence on tidal shear. Finally, we comment on the effect of using galaxies rather than halos in real observations, which can bias the inferred SZ profiles by $\sim$20\% for $L_\ast$-galaxies.","I argue that Einstein overlooked an important aspect of the relativity of time in never quite realizing his quest to embody Mach's principle in his theory of gravity. As a step towards that goal, I broaden the Strong Equivalence Principle to a new principle of physics, the Cosmological Equivalence Principle, to account for the role of the evolving average regional density of the universe in the synchronisation of clocks and the relative calibration of inertial frames. In a universe dominated by voids of the size observed in large-scale structure surveys, the density contrasts of expanding regions are strong enough that a relative deceleration of the background between voids and the environment of galaxies, typically of order 10^{-10} m/s^2, must be accounted for. As a result one finds a universe whose present age varies by billions of years according to the position of the observer: a timescape. This model universe is observationally viable: it passes three critical independent tests, and makes additional predictions.

SO(5) symmetry in the quantum Hall effect in graphene,Effects of Pb doping on structural and electronics properties of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10}$,True,"Electrons in graphene have four flavors associated with low-energy spin and valley degrees of freedom. The fractional quantum Hall effect in graphene is dominated by long-range Coulomb interactions which are invariant under rotations in spin-valley space. This SU(4) symmetry is spontaneously broken at most filling factors, and also weakly broken by atomic scale valley-dependent and valley-exchange interactions with coupling constants $g_{z}$ and $g_{\perp}$. In this paper we demonstrate that when $g_{z}=-g_{\perp}$ an exact SO(5) symmetry survives which unifies the N\'eel spin order parameter of the antiferromagnetic state and the $XY$ valley order parameter of the Kekul\'e distortion state into a single five-component order parameter. The proximity of the highly insulating quantum Hall state observed in graphene at $\nu=0$ to an ideal SO(5) symmetric quantum Hall state remains an open experimental question. We illustrate the physics associated with this SO(5) symmetry by studying the multiplet structure and collective dynamics of filling factor $\nu=0$ quantum Hall states based on exact-diagonalization and low-energy effective theory approaches. This allows to illustrate how manifestations of the SO(5) symmetry would survive even when it is weakly broken.","Pb doping effect in the Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10}$ compound (Bi2223) on the structural and electronic properties were investigated, using the Local Density (LDA) and Virtual Crystal (VCA) approximations within the framework of the Density Functional Theory (DFT), taking as reference the procedure implemented by H.Lin {\it et al.} in the Bi2212 compound [{\it Phys.

Results show that, the incorporation of Pb-dopant in Bi2223 lead a rigid displacement of the Bi/Pb-O bands toward higher energies, with a null contribution at the Fermi level, around the high symmetry point $\overline{\text{M}}$ in the irreducible Brillouin zone, for Pb doping concentration equal to or more than 26\%, avoiding the presence of the so-called Bi-O {\it pockets} in the Fermi surface, in good agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, although a slight metallic character of the Bi-O bonds is still observed which would disagree with some experimental reports.

Inexorable Edge Kondo Breakdown in Topological Kondo Insulators,Confinement-Deconfinement Transition as an Indication of Spin-Liquid-Type Behavior in Na$_2$IrO$_3$,True,"Kondo breakdown is one of the most intriguing problems in strongly correlated electron systems, as it is rooted in many anomalous electron behaviors found in heavy-fermion materials. In Kondo lattice systems, Kondo breakdown can arise from either strong magnetic frustrations or critical fluctuations of collective modes. Here, we reveal a new type of Kondo breakdown with a fully different origin in interacting topological Kondo insulators. By employing numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that with open boundary conditions, Kondo screening is inexorably destroyed by interaction effects on edges or corners in these systems. We argue that the Kondo breakdown is enforced by the symmetries of the system, because the ground states are symmetry protected Haldane phases.","We use ultrafast optical spectroscopy to observe binding of charged single-particle excitations (SE) in the magnetically frustrated Mott insulator Na$_2$IrO$_3$. Above the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature ($T_N$) the system response is due to both Hubbard excitons (HE) and their constituent unpaired SE. The SE response becomes strongly suppressed immediately below $T_N$. We argue that this increase in binding energy is due to a unique interplay between the frustrated Kitaev and the weak Heisenberg-type ordering term in the Hamiltonian, mediating an effective interaction between the spin-singlet SE. This interaction grows with distance causing the SE to become trapped in the HE, similar to quark confinement inside hadrons. This binding of charged particles, induced by magnetic ordering, is a result of a confinement-deconfinement transition of spin excitations. This observation provides evidence for spin liquid type behavior which is expected in Na$_2$IrO$_3$.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Single or Double Degenerate Progenitors? Searching for Shock Emission in the SDSS-II Type Ia Supernovae,ICE-COLA: Towards fast and accurate synthetic galaxy catalogues optimizing a quasi $N$-body method,True,"From the set of nearly 500 spectroscopically confirmed type~Ia supernovae and around 10,000 unconfirmed candidates from SDSS-II, we select a subset of 108 confirmed SNe Ia with well-observed early-time light curves to search for signatures from shock interaction of the supernova with a companion star. No evidence for shock emission is seen; however, the cadence and photometric noise could hide a weak shock signal. We simulate shocked light curves using SN Ia templates and a simple, Gaussian shock model to emulate the noise properties of the SDSS-II sample and estimate the detectability of the shock interaction signal as a function of shock amplitude, shock width, and shock fraction. We find no direct evidence for shock interaction in the rest-frame $B$-band, but place an upper limit on the shock amplitude at 9% of supernova peak flux ($M_B > -16.6$ mag). If the single degenerate channel dominates type~Ia progenitors, this result constrains the companion stars to be less than about 6 $M_{\odot}$ on the main sequence, and strongly disfavors red giant companions.","Next generation galaxy surveys demand the development of massive ensembles of galaxy mocks to model the observables and their covariances, what is computationally prohibitive using $N$-body simulations. COLA is a novel method designed to make this feasible by following an approximate dynamics but with up to 3 orders of magnitude speed-ups when compared to an exact $N$-body. In this paper we investigate the optimization of the code parameters in the compromise between computational cost and recovered accuracy in observables such as two-point clustering and halo abundance. We benchmark those observables with a state-of-the-art $N$-body run, the MICE Grand Challenge simulation (MICE-GC). We find that using 40 time steps linearly spaced since $z_i \sim 20$, and a force mesh resolution three times finer than that of the number of particles, yields a matter power spectrum within $1\%$ for $k \lesssim 1\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and a halo mass function within $5\%$ of those in the $N$-body. In turn the halo bias is accurate within $2\%$ for $k \lesssim 0.7\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ whereas, in redshift space, the halo monopole and quadrupole are within $4\%$ for $k \lesssim 0.4\,h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. These results hold for a broad range in redshift ($0 < z < 1$) and for all halo mass bins investigated ($M > 10^{12.5} \, h^{-1} \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$). To bring accuracy in clustering to one percent level we study various methods that re-calibrate halo masses and/or velocities. We thus propose an optimized choice of COLA code parameters as a powerful tool to optimally exploit future galaxy surveys.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Dynamics of supertubes,Note on Thermodynamics Method of Black Hole/CFT Correspondence,True,"We find the evolution of arbitrary excitations on 2-charge supertubes, by mapping the supertube to a string carrying traveling waves. We argue that when the coupling is increased from zero the energy of excitation leaks off to infinity, and when the coupling is increased still further a new set of long lived excitations emerge. We relate the excitations at small and large couplings to excitations in two different phases in the dual CFT. We conjecture a way to distinguish bound states from unbound states among 3-charge BPS geometries; this would identify black hole microstates among the complete set of BPS geometries.","In the paper we further refine the thermodynamics method of black hole/CFT correspondence. We show that one can derive the central charges of different holographic pictures directly from the entropy product $S_+S_-$ if it is mass-independent, for a black hole in the Einstein gravity or the gravity without diffeomorphism anomaly. For a general black hole in the Einstein gravity that admits holographic descriptions, we show that the thermodynamics method and asymptotic symmetry group (ASG) analysis can always give consistent results in the extreme limit. Furthermore, we discuss the relation between black hole thermodynamics and the hidden conformal symmetry. We show that the condition $T_+A_+=T_-A_-$, with $A_\pm$ being the outer and inner horizon areas, is the necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a black hole to have the hidden conformal symmetry. In particular, for the Einstein(-Maxwell) gravity $T_+A_+=T_-A_-$ is just the condition $T_+S_+=T_-S_-$, with $S_\pm$ being the outer and inner horizon entropies, which is the condition for the entropy product $S_+S_-$ being mass-dependent. When there exists the hidden conformal symmetry in the low-frequency scattering off the generic non-extremal black hole, it always leads to the same temperatures of dual CFT as the ones got from the thermodynamics method.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Nonequilibrium spectral moment sum rules of the Holstein-Hubbard model,"Resistivity, Hall effect and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in CeNiSn",True,"We derive a general procedure for evaluating the ${\rm n}$th derivative of a time-dependent operator in the Heisenberg representation and employ this approach to calculate the zeroth to third spectral moment sum rules of the retarded electronic Green's function and self-energy for a system described by the Holstein-Hubbard model allowing for arbitrary spatial and time variation of all parameters (including spatially homogeneous electric fields and parameter quenches). For a translationally invariant (but time-dependent) Hamiltonian, we also provide sum rules in momentum space. The sum rules can be applied to various different phenomena like time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and benchmarking the accuracy of numerical many-body calculations. This work also corrects some errors found in earlier work on simpler models.","The resistivity and Hall effect in CeNiSn are measured at temperatures down to 35 mK and in magnetic fields up to 20 T with the current applied along the {\it b} axis. The resistivity at zero field exhibits quadratic temperature dependence below $\sim$0.16 K with a huge coefficient of the $T^2$ term (54 $\mu$$\Omega$cm/K$^2$). The resistivity as a function of field shows an anomalous maximum and dip, the positions of which vary with field directions. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations with a frequency {\it F} of $\sim$100 T are observed for a wide range of field directions in the {\it ac} and {\it bc} planes, and the quasiparticle mass is determined to be $\sim$10-20 {\it m}$_e$. The carrier density is estimated to be $\sim10^{-3}$ electron/Ce. In a narrow range of field directions in the {\it ac} plane, where the magnetoresistance-dip anomaly manifests itself clearer than in other field directions, a higher-frequency ($F=300\sim400\text{T}$) SdH oscillation is found at high fields above the anomaly.

Constraining the equation of state with heavy quarks in the quasi-particle model of QCD matter,Global performance of covariant density functional theory in description of charge radii and related indicators,True,"In a quasi-particle model of QCD matter at finite temperature with thermal masses for quarks and gluons from hard thermal loops, the equation of state (EOS) can be described by an effective temperature dependence of the strong coupling $g(T)$. Assuming the same effective coupling between the exchanged gluon and thermal partons, the EOS can also be related to parton energy loss.} Based on the quasi-particle linear Boltzmann transport (QLBT) model coupled to a (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) evolution and a hybrid fragmentation-coalescence model for heavy quark hadronization, we perform a Bayesian analysis of the experimental data on $D$ meson suppression $R_{\rm AA}$ and anisotropy $v_2$ at RHIC and the LHC. We achieve a simultaneous constraint on the QGP EOS and the heavy quark transport coefficient, both consistent with the lattice QCD results.","A short review of existing efforts to understand charge radii and related indicators on a global scale within the covariant density functional theory (CDFT) is presented. Using major classes of covariant energy density functionals (CEDFs), the global accuracy of the description of experimental absolute and differential charge radii within the CDFT framework has been established. This assessment is supplemented by an evaluation of theoretical statistical and systematic uncertainties in the description of charge radii.

As function of the distance to the gate, or the electron density in the wire, the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state to two kinds of dissipative phases, one of them with a finite spatial correlation length. We also define a dual model, which describes an attractive one dimensional metal with a Josephson coupling to a dirty metallic lead.","A theoretical model is proposed to describe asymmetric gate-voltage dependence of conductance and noise in two-terminal ballistic graphene devices. The model is analyzed independently within the self-consistent Hartree and Thomas-Fermi approximations. Our results justify the prominent role of metal contacts in recent experiments with suspended graphene flakes. The contact-induced electrostatic potentials in graphene demonstrate a power-law decay with the exponent varying from -1 to -0.5.

The SAMI Galaxy Survey: impact of black hole activity on galaxy spin-filament alignments,Discovery of a Low-Redshift Damped Ly$\alpha$ System in a Foreground Extended Disk Using a Starburst Galaxy Background Illuminator,True,"The activity of central supermassive black holes might affect the alignment of galaxy spin axes with respect to the closest cosmic filaments. We exploit the SAMI Galaxy Survey to study possible relations between black hole activity and the spin-filament alignments of stars and ionised gas separately. To explore the impact of instantaneous black hole activity, active galaxies are selected according to emission-line diagnostics. Central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_c$) is used as a proxy for black hole mass and its integrated activity. We find evidence for the gas spin-filament alignments to be influenced by AGN, with Seyfert galaxies showing a stronger perpendicular alignment at fixed bulge mass with respect to galaxies where ionisation is consequence of low-ionizaition nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) or old stellar populations (retired galaxies). On the other hand, the greater perpendicular tendency for the stellar spin-filament alignments of high-bulge mass galaxies is dominated by retired galaxies. Stellar alignments show a stronger correlation with $\sigma_c$ compared to the gas alignments. We confirm that bulge mass ($M_{bulge}$) is the primary parameter of correlation for both stellar and gas spin-filament alignments (with no residual dependency left for $\sigma_c$), while $\sigma_c$ is the most important property for secular star formation quenching (with no residual dependency left for $M_{bulge}$). These findings indicate that $M_{bulge}$ and $\sigma_c$ are the most predictive parameters of two different galaxy evolution processes, suggesting mergers trigger spin-filament alignment flips and integrated black hole activity drives star formation quenching.","We present the discovery of a low-redshift damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) system in the spectrum of background starburst galaxy SDSS J111323.88+293039.3 ($z=0.17514$). The DLA is at an impact parameter of $\rm \rho=36~kpc$ from the star forming galaxy, SDSS J111324.08+293051.2 ($z=0.17077$). We measure an HI column density of $N($HI$)\rm =3.47\times10^{20}~cm^{-2}$ along with multiple low-ionization species such as NI, NII, SiII, CII, and SiIII. We also make an estimate of the covering fraction to be 0.883, giving us a limiting size of the DLA to be $A_{DLA}\rm \geq3.3~kpc^2$. Assuming a uniform column density over the entire DLA system, we estimate its mass to be $M_{DLA}\geq5.3\times 10^6~M_\odot$. The extended illuminator and the low redshift of this DLA give us the unique opportunity to characterize its nature and the connection to its host galaxy. We measure a velocity offset of +131 km s$^{-1}$ from the systemic velocity of the host for the DLA. This velocity is $-84$ km s$^{-1}$ from the projected rotation velocity of the host galaxy as measured using a newly constructed rotation curve. Based on the size of the host galaxy, the HI column density, and the gas kinematics, we believe this DLA is tracing the warm neutral gas in the HI disk of the foreground galaxy.

The dependencies of the Skyrmion fields on the cosmological constant and on the strength of the effective gravitational coupling are examined. We show that the increase of the absolute value of the cosmological constant qualitatively yields the same effect as increasing of the effective gravitational coupling. We confirm that, similar to the model in the asymptotically flat space-time, a necessary condition for the existence of black holes with Skyrmionic hair is the inclusion of the Skyrme term.","We consider defining a fuzzy space by a specific state in a fermionic field theory in terms of which all the observables for the space can be evaluated. This allows for a definition of entanglement for a fuzzy space by direct integration of the fields over a certain region.

A reduction to four dimensions occurs through compactification of one dimension but not only. By choosing a lattice spacing in the extra dimension larger than in the other dimensions, we find hints that the hyperplanes orthogonal to the extra dimension decouple from each other. Our analysis is based on measurements of Polyakov loops, the static potential extracted from Wilson loops and renormalized couplings defined through the static force and its derivative.","We present a first order formulation for the fourth order action of the new massive dual gravity in four dimensions.

Integrating out the Standard Higgs Field in the Path Integral,Instability of a gapless color superconductor with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations,True,"We integrate out the Higgs boson in the electroweak standard model at one loop and construct a low-energy effective Lagrangian assuming that the Higgs mass is much larger than the gauge-boson masses. Instead of applying diagrammatical techniques, we integrate out the Higgs boson directly in the path integral, which turns out to be much simpler. By using the background-field method and the Stueckelberg formalism, we directly find a manifestly gauge-invariant result. The heavy-Higgs effects on fermionic couplings are derived, too. At one loop the $\log\MH$-terms of the heavy-Higgs limit of the electroweak standard model coincide with the UV-divergent terms in the gauged non-linear $\sigma$-model, but vertex functions differ in addition by finite constant terms.

Computational Analysis of Factors Influencing Enhancement of Thermal Conductivity of Nanofluids,Anisotropic colloids through non-trivial buckling,True,"Numerical investigations are conducted to study the effect of factors such as particle clustering and interfacial layer thickness on thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Based on this, parameters including Kapitza radius, and fractal and chemical dimension which have received little attention by previous research are rigorously investigated. The degree of thermal enhancement is analysed for increasing aggregate size, particle concentration, interfacial thermal resistance, and fractal and chemical dimensions. This analysis is conducted for water-based nanofluids of Alumina (Al2O3), CuO and Titania (TiO2) nanoparticles where the particle concentrations are varied up to 4vol%. Results from the numerical work are validated using available experimental data. For the case of aggregate size, particle concentration and interfacial thermal resistance; the aspect ratio (ratio of radius of gyration of aggregate to radius of primary particle, Rg/a) is varied between 2 to 60. It was found that the enhancement decreases with interfacial layer thickness. Also the rate of decrease is more significant after a given aggregate size. For a given interfacial resistance, the enhancement is mostly sensitive to Rg/a <20 indicated by the steep gradients of data plots. Predicted and experimental data for thermal conductivity enhancement are in good agreement.","We present a study on buckling of colloidal particles, including experimental, theoretical and numerical developments.

We observed a secondary eclipse of WASP-46b simultaneously in the g'r'i'z'JHK bands using the GROND instrument on the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. Eclipse depths of the acquired light curves were derived to infer the brightness temperatures at multibands that cover the SED peak. We report the first detection of the thermal emission from the dayside of WASP-46b in the K band at 4.2-sigma level and tentative detections in the H (2.5-sigma) and J (2.3-sigma) bands, with flux ratios of 0.253 +0.063/-0.060%, 0.194 +/- 0.078%, and 0.129 +/- 0.055%, respectively. The derived brightness temperatures (2306 +177/-187K, 2462 +245/-302K, and 2453 +198/-258K, respectively) are consistent with an isothermal temperature profile of 2386K, which is significantly higher than the dayside-averaged equilibrium temperature, indicative of very poor heat redistribution efficiency. We also investigate the tentative detections in the g'r'i' bands and the 3-sigma upper limit in the z' band, which might indicate the existence of reflective clouds if these tentative detections do not arise from systematics.","The aim of this paper is to determinate the fundamental parameters of six exoplanet host (EH) stars and their planets. While techniques for detecting exoplanets yield properties of the planet only as a function of the properties of the host star, hence, we must accurately determine parameters of EH stars at first. For this reason, we constructed a grid of stellar models including diffusion and rotation-induced extra-mixing with given ranges of input parameters (i.e. mass, metallicity, and initial rotation rate). In addition to the commonly used observational constraints such as the effective temperature T_{eff}, luminosity L and metallicity [Fe/H], we added two observational constraints, the lithium abundance log N (Li) and the rotational period P_{rot}. These two additional observed parameters can make further constrains on the model due to their correlations with mass, age and other stellar properties. Hence, our estimations of fundamental parameters for these EH stars and their planets are with higher precision than previous works.

Furthermore, it is shown that in the complimentary region of parameter space there are no small unstable eigenvalues.

Learning the Alpha-bits of Black Holes,"On complexity growth in massive gravity theories, the effects of chirality and more",True,"When the bulk geometry in AdS/CFT contains a black hole, the boundary reconstruction of a given bulk operator will often necessarily depend on the choice of black hole microstate, an example of state dependence. As a result, whether a given bulk operator can be reconstructed on the boundary at all can depend on whether the black hole is described by a pure state or thermal ensemble. We refine this dichotomy, demonstrating that the same boundary operator can often be used for large subspaces of black hole microstates, corresponding to a constant fraction $\alpha$ of the black hole entropy. In the Schrodinger picture, the boundary subregion encodes the $\alpha$-bits (a concept from quantum information) of a bulk region containing the black hole and bounded by extremal surfaces. These results have important consequences for the structure of AdS/CFT and for quantum information. Firstly, they imply that the bulk reconstruction is necessarily only approximate and allow us to place non-perturbative lower bounds on the error when doing so. Second, they provide a simple and tractable limit in which the entanglement wedge is state-dependent, but in a highly controlled way. Although the state dependence of operators comes from ordinary quantum error correction, there are clear connections to the Papadodimas-Raju proposal for understanding operators behind black hole horizons. In tensor network toy models of AdS/CFT, we see how state dependence arises from the bulk operator being `pushed' through the black hole itself. Finally, we show that black holes provide the first `explicit' examples of capacity-achieving $\alpha$-bit codes. Unintuitively, Hawking radiation always reveals the $\alpha$-bits of a black hole as soon as possible. In an appendix, we apply a result from the quantum information literature to prove that entanglement wedge reconstruction can be made exact to all orders in $1/N$.","To study the effect of parity-violation on the rate of complexity growth, by using ""Complexity=Action"" conjecture, we find the complexity growth rates in different solutions of the chiral theory of Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) and parity-preserving theory of New Massive Gravity (NMG). Using the results, one can see that decreasing the parameter $\mu$, which increases the effect of Chern-Simons term and increases chirality, would increase the rate of growth of complexity. Also one can observe a stronger correlation between complexity growth and temperature rather than complexity growth and entropy. At the end we comment on the possible meaning of the deforming term of chiral Liouville action for the rate of complexity growth of warped CFTs in the Tensor Network Renormalization picture.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Inclusive and exclusive decays of doubly heavy baryons,Top quark polarization as a probe of $t\bar{t}$ threshold dynamics,True,In this paper we give a short review of the recently obtained results on inclusive and exclusive decays of doubly heavy baryons.,"We study the spin properties of top quarks produced in collisions of polarized photons in the threshold region. For a relatively heavy top quark the influence of non-perturbative effects is small and its polarization parameters can be predicted in perturbative QCD. The measurements of the top polarization may allow a novel test of QCD in the $t\bar{t}$ system. In particular, they may provide a new way to determine the precise value of $\alpha_s$ and to study the properties of the top quark.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Dynamical system analysis of dark energy models in scalar coupled metric-torsion theories,On Tachyon kinks from the DBI action,True,"We study the phase space dynamics of cosmological models in the theoretical formulations of non-minimal metric-torsion couplings with a scalar field, and investigate in particular the critical points which yield stable solutions exhibiting cosmic acceleration driven by the {\em dark energy}. The latter is defined in a way that it effectively has no direct interaction with the cosmological fluid, although in an equivalent scalar-tensor cosmological setup the scalar field interacts with the fluid (which we consider to be the pressureless dust). Determining the conditions for the existence of the stable critical points we check their physical viability, in both Einstein and Jordan frames. We also verify that in either of these frames, the evolution of the universe at the corresponding stable points matches with that given by the respective exact solutions we have found in an earlier work (arXiv: 1611.00654 [gr-qc]). We not only examine the regions of physical relevance for the trajectories in the phase space when the coupling parameter is varied, but also demonstrate the evolution profiles of the cosmological parameters of interest along fiducial trajectories in the effectively non-interacting scenarios, in both Einstein and Jordan frames.","We consider solitonic solutions of the DBI tachyon effective action for a non-BPS brane in the presence of an electric field. We find that for a constant electric field $\tilde E\le 1$, regular solitons compactified on a circle admit a singular and decompactified limit corresponding to Sen's proposal provided the tachyon potential satisfies some restrictions. On the other hand for the critical electric field $\tilde E=1$, regular and finite energy solitons are constructed without any restriction on the potential.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Modeling tissue perfusion in terms of 1d-3d embedded mixed-dimension coupled problems with distributed sources,Electron-phonon coupling and hot electron thermalization in titanium nitride,True,"We present a new method for modeling tissue perfusion on the capillary scale. The microvasculature is represented by a network of one-dimensional vessel segments embedded in the extra-vascular space. Vascular and extra-vascular space exchange fluid over the vessel walls. This exchange is modeled by distributed sources using smooth kernel functions for the extra-vascular domain. It is shown that the proposed method may significantly improve the approximation of the exchange flux, in comparison with existing methods for mixed-dimension embedded problems. Furthermore, the method exhibits better convergence rates of the relevant quantities due to the increased regularity of the extra-vascular pressure solution. Numerical experiments with a vascular network from the rat cortex show that the error in the approximation of the exchange flux for coarse grid resolution may be decreased by a factor of $3$. This may open the way for computing on larger network domains, where a fine grid resolution cannot be achieved in practical simulations due to constraints in computational resources, for example in the context of uncertainty quantification.","We have studied the thermalization of hot carriers in both pristine and defective titanium nitride (TiN) using a two-temperature model. All parameters of this model, including the electron-phonon coupling parameter, were obtained from first-principles density-functional theory calculations. The virtual crystal approximation was used to describe defective systems. We find that thermalization of hot carriers occurs on much faster time scales than in gold as a consequence of the significantly stronger electron-phonon coupling in TiN. Specifically, the largest thermalization times, on the order of 200 femtoseconds, are found in TiN with nitrogen vacancies for electron temperatures around 4000 K.",Computational Physics,Computational physics focuses on all aspects of computational science applied to physics.
Excitonic switches at 100 K temperatures,Renormalization of the dephasing by zero point fluctuations,True,"Photonic and optoelectronic devices may offer the opportunity to realize efficient signal processing at speeds higher than in conventional electronic devices. Switches form the building blocks for circuits and fast photonic switches have been realized [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Recently, proof of principle of exciton optoelectronic devices was demonstrated [7,8]. Potential advantages of excitonic devices include high operation and interconnection speed, small dimensions, and the opportunity to combine many elements into integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate experimental proof of principle for the operation of excitonic switching devices at temperatures around 100 K. The devices are based on an AlAs/GaAs coupled quantum well structure and include the exciton optoelectronic transistor (EXOT), the excitonic bridge modulator (EXBM), and the excitonic pinch-off modulator (EXPOM). This is a two orders of magnitude increase in the operation temperature compared to the earlier devices, where operation was demonstrated at 1.5 K [7,8].","We study the role of zero-point-fluctuations (ZPF) in dephasing at low temperature. Unlike the Caldeira-Leggett model where the interaction is with an homogeneous fluctuating field of force, here we consider the effect of short range scattering by localized bath modes. We find that in presence of ZPF the inelastic cross-section gets renormalized. Thus indirectly ZPF might contribute to the dephasing at low temperature.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

No correlation of the Lyman continuum escape fraction with spectral hardness,Detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the vicinity of PSR B1706-44 with H.E.S.S,True,"The properties that govern the production and escape of hydrogen ionizing photons (Lyman continuum, LyC; with energies >13.6 eV) in star-forming galaxies are still poorly understood, but they are key to identifying and characterizing the sources that reionized the Universe. Here we empirically explore the relationship between the hardness of ionizing radiation and the LyC leakage in a large sample of low-$z$ star-forming galaxies from the recent Hubble Space Telescope Low-$z$ Lyman Continuum Survey. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey stacks and deep XShooter observations, we investigate the hardness of the ionizing spectra ($Q_{\rm He^+}/Q_{\rm H}$) between 54.4 eV (He$^{+}$) and 13.6 eV (H) from the optical recombination lines HeII 4686A and H$\beta$ 4861A for galaxies with LyC escape fractions spanning a wide range, $f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC) \simeq 0 - 90\%$. We find that the observed intensity of HeII/H$\beta$ is primarily driven by variations in the metallicity, but is not correlated with LyC leakage. Both very strong ($<f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC)> \simeq 0.5$) and nonleakers ($ < f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC) > \simeq 0$) present similar observed intensities of HeII/H$\beta$ at comparable metallicity, between $\simeq 0.01$ and $\simeq 0.02$ for $12 + \log({\rm O/H}) > 8.0$ and $<8.0$, respectively. Our results demonstrate that $Q_{\rm He^+}/Q_{\rm H}$ does not correlate with $f_{\rm esc} \rm (LyC)$, which implies that strong LyC emitters do not show harder ionizing spectra than nonleakers at similar metallicity.","The energetic pulsar PSR B1706-44 and the adjacent supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G 343.1-2.3 were observed by H.E.S.S. during a dedicated observational campaign in 2007. A new source of very-high-energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission, HESS J1708-443, was discovered with its centroid at RA(J2000) = 17h08m10s and Dec(J2000) = -44d21', with a statistical error of 3 arcmin on each axis. The VHE gamma-ray source is significantly more extended than the H.E.S.S. point-spread function, with an intrinsic Gaussian width of 0.29 +/- 0.04 deg. Its energy spectrum can be described by a power law with a photon index Gamma = 2.0 +/- 0.1 (stat) +/- 0.2 (sys).

Constraining the top-light initial mass function in the extended ultraviolet disk of M83,Nebular H$\alpha$ Limits for Fast Declining Type Ia Supernovae,True,"The universality or non-universality of the initial mass function (IMF) has significant implications for determining star formation rates and star formation histories from photometric properties of stellar populations. We reexamine whether the IMF is deficient in high-mass stars (top-light) in the low-density environment of the outer disk of M83 and constrain the shape of the IMF therein. Using archival Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV) data and new deep OmegaCAM narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging, we constructed a catalog of FUV-selected objects in the outer disk of M83. We counted H$\alpha$-bright clusters and clusters that are blue in FUV$-$NUV in the catalog, measured the maximum flux ratio $F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$ among the clusters, and measured the total flux ratio $\Sigma F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/\Sigma f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$ over the catalog. We then compared these measurements to predictions from stellar population synthesis models made with a standard Salpeter IMF, truncated IMFs, and steep IMFs. We also investigated the effect of varying the assumed internal extinction on our results. We are not able to reproduce our observations with models using the standard Salpeter IMF or the truncated IMFs. It is only when assuming an average internal extinction of $0.10 < A_{\mathrm{V}} < 0.15$ in the outer disk stellar clusters that models with steep IMFs ($\alpha > 3.1$) simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster counts, the maximum observed $F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$, and the observed $\Sigma F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/\Sigma f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$. Our results support a non-universal IMF that is deficient in high-mass stars in low-density environments.","One clear observational prediction of the single degenerate progenitor scenario as the origin of type Ia supernovae (SNe) is the presence of relatively narrow ($\approx$1000 km s$^{-1}$) H$\alpha$ emission at nebular phases, although this feature is rarely seen. We present a compilation of nebular phase H$\alpha$ limits for SN Ia in the literature and demonstrate that this heterogenous sample has been biased towards SN Ia with relatively high luminosities and slow decline rates, as parameterized by $\Delta$m$_{15}(B)$, the difference in $B$-band magnitude between maximum light and fifteen days afterward. Motivated by the need to explore the full parameter space of SN~Ia and their subtypes, we present two new and six previously published nebular spectra of SN Ia with $\Delta$m$_{15}(B)$$ > $1.3 mag (including members of the transitional and SN1991bg-like subclasses) and measure nondetection limits of $L_{H\alpha}$$~<~$0.85--9.9$\times$10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, which we confirmed by implanting simulated H$\alpha$ emission into our data. Based on the lastest models of swept-up material stripped from a nondegenerate companion star, these $L_{H\alpha}$ values correspond to hydrogen mass limits of $M_H$$~\lesssim~$1-3$\times$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$, roughly three orders of magnitude below that expected for the systems modeled, although we note that no simulations of H$\alpha$ nebular emission in such weak explosions have yet been performed. Despite the recent detection of strong H$\alpha$ in ASASSN-18tb (SN 2018fhw; $\Delta$m$_{15}(B)$ = 2.0 mag), we see no evidence that fast declining systems are more likely to have late time H$\alpha$ emission, although a larger sample is needed to confirm this result.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Earthquake magnitude distribution and aftershocks: a statistical geometry explanation,Sensitivity of Love and quasi-Rayleigh waves to model parameters,True,"The emergence of a power-law distribution for the energy released during an earthquake is investigated in several models. Generic features are identified which are based on the self-affine behavior of the stress field prior to an event. This field behaves at large scale as a random trajectory in 1 dimension of space and a random surface in 2 dimensions. Using concepts of statistical mechanics and results on the properties of these random objects, several predictions are obtained and verified, in particular the value of the power-law exponent of the earthquake energy distribution (the Gutenberg-Richter law) as well as a mechanism for the existence of aftershocks after a large earthquake (the Omori law).","We examine the sensitivity of the Love and the quasi-Rayleigh waves to model parameters. Both waves are guided waves that propagate in the same model of an elastic layer above an elastic halfspace. We study their dispersion curves without any simplifying assumptions, beyond the standard approach of elasticity theory in isotropic media. We examine the sensitivity of both waves to elasticity parameters, frequency and layer thickness, for varying frequency and different modes. In the case of Love waves, we derive and plot the absolute value of a dimensionless sensitivity coefficient in terms of partial derivatives, and perform an analysis to find the optimum frequency for determining the layer thickness. For a coherency of the background information, we briefly review the Love-wave dispersion relation and provide details of the less common derivation of the quasi-Rayleigh relation in an appendix.

Gravitino DM and high reheating temperatures after LHC 7/8,Flavor Neutrino Oscillations and Time-Energy Uncertainty Relation,True,The presence of high reheating temperatures in the thermal history of the universe challenges supersymmetric scenarios owing to the gravitino problem.

Kinetic Equations for Diffusion in the Presence of Entropic Barriers,Equation of state of compressed matter: A simple statistical model,True,"We use the mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics theory to derive the general kinetic equation of a system in the presence of potential barriers. The result is applied to the description of the evolution of systems whose dynamics is influenced by entropic barriers. We analyze in detail the case of diffusion in a domain of irregular geometry in which the presence of the boundaries induces an entropy barrier when approaching the exact dynamics by a coarsening of the description. The corresponding kinetic equation, named Fick-Jacobs equation, is obtained, and its validity is generalized through the formulation of a scaling law for the diffusion coefficient which depends on the shape of the boundaries. The method we propose can be useful to analyze the dynamics of systems at the nanoscale where the presence of entropy barriers is a common feature.","We propose a simple approach for studying systems of compressed matter based on the Thomas-Fermi statistical model of single atom. The central point of our work is the development of the concept of ``statistical ionization'' by compression; in simple terms, we calculate the fraction of electrons within the atom whose positive energy, due to the compression, exceeds the negative binding energy electron-nucleus. Next we extend this concept from a single atom to macroscopic systems and write the corresponding equation of state.

Minkowski Space Non-Abelian Classical Solutions with Non-Integer Winding Number Change,Electroweak Penguin Effects In Some $B_s^0$ Two-Body Decays,True,"Working in a spherically symmetric ansatz in Minkowski space we discover new solutions to the classical equations of motion of pure $SU(2)$ gauge theory. These solutions represent spherical shells of energy which at early times move inward near the speed of light, excite the region of space around the origin at intermediate times and move outward at late times. The solutions change the winding number in bounded regions centered at the origin by non-integer amounts. They also produce non-integer topological charge in these regions. We show that the previously discovered solutions of Luscher and Schechter also have these properties.","Using the next-to-leading order low energy effective Hamiltonian for $\Delta B=1$ transitions, the effects of electroweak penguin operators in some two-body decay modes of $B_s^0$ meson are estimated in the Standard Model (SM). We find that in $B_s^0\to\pi^+ K^-$ and $B_s^0\to K^+K^-$ decay modes, the electroweak penguin effects are small, while in $B_s^0\to\pi^0\bar{K^0}$, $\phi\bar{K^0}$, $\phi\phi$, the electroweak penguin operators enhance or reduce the pure QCD penguin and tree level contributions by $20%\sim 80%$ in decay width.

Anomalously Strong Nonlinearity of Unswept Quartz Acoustic Cavities at Liquid Helium Temperatures,Localization Length in Quasi One Dimensional Disordered System Revised,True,"We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear phenomena at extremely low powers in cryogenic acoustic cavities fabricated from quartz material, which have not undergone any electrodiffusion processes. Nonlinear phenomena observed include lineshape discontinuities, power response discontinuities, quadrature oscillations and self-induced transparency. These phenomena are attributed to nonlinear dissipation through a large number of randomly distributed heavy trapped ions, which would normally be removed by electrodiffusion. A simple mean-field model predicts most of the observed phenomena. In contrast to Duffing-like systems, this system shows an unusual mechanism of nonlinearity, which is not related to crystal anharmonisity.","In the weak disordered regime we provide analytical expressions for the electron localization lengths in quasi-one dimensional (Q1D) disordered quantum wire with hard wall and periodic boundary conditions. They are exact up to order $W^2$ ($W$ being the disorder strength) for an arbitrary number of channels.

Computing bulk and shear viscosities from simulations of fluids with dissipative and stochastic interactions,Structural Origin of the Two-Step Glass Transition,True,"Exact values for bulk and shear viscosity are important to characterize a fluid and they are a necessary input for a continuum description. Here we present two novel methods to compute bulk viscosities by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of steady-state systems with periodic boundary conditions -- one based on frequent particle displacements and one based on the application of external bulk forces with an inhomogeneous force profile. In equilibrium simulations, viscosities can be determined from the stress tensor fluctuations via Green-Kubo relations; however, the correct incorporation of random and dissipative forces is not obvious. We discuss different expressions proposed in the literature and test them at the example of a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) fluid.","The glass transition is a long-standing problem in physics. Identifying the structural origin of the transition may lead to the ultimate solution to the problem. Here, for the first time, we discover such a structural origin by proposing a novel method to analyze structure-dynamics relation in glasses. An interesting two-step glass transition, with rotational glass transition preceding translational one, is identified experimentally in 2D colloidal rod systems. During the transition, parallel and perpendicularly packed rods are found to form local free energy minima in configurational space, separated by an activation barrier. This barrier increases significantly when rotational glass transition is approached; thereby the rotational motion is frozen while the translational one remains diffusive. We argue that the activation barrier for rotation is the origin of the two-step glass transition. Such an activation barrier between well-defined local configurations holds the key to understand the two-step glass transition in general.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Electrical transport and magnetic properties of nanostructured La0.67Ca0.33MnO3,Anodic TiO2 nanotube layers: why does self-organized growth occur - A mini review,True,"Nanostructured La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 (NS-LCMO) was formed by pulsed-laser deposition on the surface of porous Al2O3. The resistance peak temperature (Tp) of the NS-LCMO increases with increasing average thickness of the films, while their Curie temperatures (Tc) remain unchanged. The coercive field of the samples increases with decreasing film thickness and its temperature dependence can be well described by Hc(T) = Hc(0)[1-(T/TB)1/2].

The Cosmological Constant Problem and Re-interpretation of Time,Conservative relativity principle: Logical ground and analysis of relevant experiments,True,"We abandon the interpretation that time is a global parameter in quantum mechanics, replace it by a quantum dynamical variable playing the role of time. This operational re-interpretation of time provides a solution to the cosmological constant problem. The expectation value of the zero-point energy under the new time variable vanishes. The fluctuation of the vacuum energy as the leading contribution to the gravitational effect gives a correct order to the observed ""dark energy"". The ""dark energy"" as a mirage is always seen comparable with the matter energy density by an observer using the internal clock time. Conceptual consequences of the re-interpretation of time are also discussed.","We suggest a new relativity principle, which asserts the impossibility to distinguish the state of rest and the state of motion at the constant velocity of a system, if no work is done to the system in question during its motion. We suggest calling this new rule as ""conservative relativity principle"" (CRP). In the case of an empty space, CRP is reduced to the Einstein special relativity principle. We also show that CRP is compatible with the general relativity principle. One of important implications of CRP is the dependence of the proper time of a charged particle on the electric potential at its location. In the present paper we consider the relevant experimental facts gathered up to now, where the latter effect can be revealed. We show that in atomic physics the introduction of this effect furnishes a better convergence between theory and experiment than that provided by the standard approach. Finally, we reanalyze the Moessbauer experiments in rotating systems and show that the obtained recently puzzling deviation of the relative energy shift between emission and absorption lines from the relativistic prediction can be explained by the CRP.",General Physics,"General physics focuses on multidisciplinary topics, speculative ideas, and proposals that cover more than one area of physics.

Covariant conserved currents for scalar-tensor Horndeski theory,The large-separation expansion of peak clustering in Gaussian random fields,True,"The scalar-tensor theories have become popular recently in particular in connection with attempts to explain present accelerated expansion of the universe, but they have been considered as a natural extension of general relativity long time ago. The Horndeski scalar-tensor theory involving four invariantly defined Lagrangians is a natural choice since it implies field equations involving at most second derivatives. Following the formalisms of defining covariant global quantities and conservation laws for perturbations of spacetimes in standard general relativity we extend these methods to the general Horndeski theory and find the covariant conserved currents for all four Lagrangians. The current is also constructed in the case of linear perturbations involving both metric and scalar field. As a specific illustration we derive a superpotential which leads to the covariantly conserved current in the Branse-Dicke theory.","In the peaks approach, the formation sites of observable structures in the Universe are identified as peaks in the matter density field. The statistical properties of the clustering of peaks are particularly important in this respect. In this paper, we investigate the large-separation expansion of the correlation function of peaks in Gaussian random fields. The analytic formula up to third order is derived, and the resultant expression can be evaluated by a combination of one-dimensional fast Fourier transforms, which are evaluated very fast.

The space of symmetric squares of hyperelliptic curves and integrable Hamiltonian polynomial systems on $\bbbR^4$,Cellular Automata and Ultra-Discrete Painlev\'e Equations,True,"We construct Lie algebras of vector fields on universal bundles $\mathcal{E}^2_{N,0}$ of symmetric squares of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g=1,2,\dots$, where $g=\left[\frac{N-1}{2}\right], \ N=3,4,\ldots$. For each of these Lie algebras, the Lie subalgebra of vertical fields has commuting generators, while the generators of the Lie subalgebra of projectable fields determines the canonical representation of the Lie subalgebra with generators $L_{2q}$, $q=-1, 0, 1, 2, \dots$, of the Witt algebra. We give explicitly a bi-rational equivalence of the space $\mathcal{E}^2_{N,0}$ and $\bbbC^{N+1}$ (in the case $N=5$ it is a well known result of Dubrovin and Novikov) and construct a polynomial Lie algebra on $\bbbC^{N+1}$, which contains two commuting generators. These commuting generators results in two compatible polynomial dynamical systems on $\bbbR^4$, which possess two common polynomial first integrals. Moreover, these systems are Hamiltonian and thus Liouville integrable. Using Abel-Jacobi two point map the solutions of these systems can be given in terms of functions defined on universal covering of the universal bundle of the Jacobians of the curves. These functions are not Abelian if $g\ne 2$. Finally we give explicit solutions of the constructed Hamiltonian systems on $\bbbR^4$ in the cases $N=3,4,5$.",Starting from integrable cellular automata we present a novel form of Painlev\'e equations.

Scalably manufactured high-index atomic layer-polymer hybrid metasurfaces for high-efficiency virtual reality metaoptics in the visible,Topolectrical-circuit octupole insulator with topologically protected corner states,True,"Metalenses, which exhibit superior light-modulating performance with sub-micrometer-scale thicknesses, are suitable alternatives to conventional bulky refractive lenses. However, fabrication limitations, such as a high cost, low throughput, and small patterning area, hinder their mass production. Here, we demonstrate the mass production of low-cost, high-throughput, and large-aperture visible metalenses using an argon fluoride immersion scanner and wafer-scale nanoimprint lithography. Once a 12-inch master stamp is imprinted, hundreds of centimeter-scale metalenses can be fabricated. To enhance light confinement, the printed metasurface is thinly coated with a high-index film, resulting in drastic increase of conversion efficiency. As a proof of concept, a prototype of a virtual reality device with ultralow thickness is demonstrated with the fabricated metalens.","Recent theoretical studies have extended the Berry phase framework to account for higher electric multipole moments, quadrupole and octupole topological phases have been proposed. Although the two-dimensional quantized quadrupole insulators have been demonstrated experimentally, octupole topological phases have not previously been observed experimentally. Here we report on the experimental realization of classical analog of octupole topological insulator in the electric circuit system. Three-dimensional topolectrical circuits for realizing such topological phases are constructed experimentally. We observe octupole topological states protected by the topology of the bulk, which are localized at the corners. Our results provide conclusive evidence of a form of robustness against disorder and deformation, which is characteristic of octupole topological insulators.

Measurements of Extended Magnetic Fields in Laser-Solid Interaction,Effect of density changes on tokamak plasma confinement,True,"Magnetic fields generated from a laser-foil interaction are measured with high fidelity using a proton radiography scheme with in situ x-ray fiducials. In contrast to prior findings under similar experimental conditions, this technique reveals the self-generated, Biermann-battery fields extend beyond the edge of the expanding plasma plume to a radius of over 3.5 mm by t=+1.4 ns, a result not captured in state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamics simulations. An analysis of two mono-energetic proton populations confirms that proton deflection is dominated by magnetic fields far from the interaction (>2 mm) and electric fields are insignificant. Comparisons to prior work suggest a new physics mechanism for the magnetic field generation and transport in laser-solid interactions.","A change of the particle density (by gas puff, pellets or impurity seeding) during the plasma discharge in tokamak produces a radial current and implicitly a torque and rotation that can modify the state of confinement. After ionization the newly born ions will evolve toward the periodic neoclassical orbits (trapped or circulating) but the first part of their excursion, which precedes the periodicity, is an effective radial current. It is short, spatially finite and unique for each new ion, but multiplied by the rate of ionization and it can produce a substantial total radial current. The associated torque induces rotation which modify the transport processes. We derive the magnitude of the radial current induced by ionization by three methods: the analysis of a simple physical picture, a numerical model and the neoclassical drift-kinetic treatment. The results of the three approaches are in agreement and show that the current can indeed be substantial. Many well known experimental observations can be reconsidered under this perspective.

Results from Long-Term Optical Monitoring of the Soft X-Ray Transient SAX J1810.8-2609,Numerical Relativity Simulations of Precessing Binary Neutron Star Mergers,True,"In this paper we report the long-term optical observation of the faint soft X-ray transient SAX J1810.8-2609 from OGLE and MOA. We have focused on the 2007 outburst, and also did the cross-correlate between its optical light curves and the quasi-simultaneous X-ray observations from swift. Both the optical and X-ray light curves of 2007 outburst show multi-peak features. Quasi-simultaneous optical/X-ray luminosity shows that both the X-ray reprocessing and viscously thermal emission can explain the observed optical flux. There is a slightly X-ray delay of 0.6+-0.3 days during the first peak, while the X-ray emission lags the optical emission by ~2 days during the rebrightening stage, which suggests that X-ray reprocessing emission contributes significantly to the optical flux in the first peak, but the viscously-heated-disk origin dominates the optical flux during rebrightening. It implies variation of the physical environment of the outer disk, even the source stayed in low-hard state during the whole outburst. The ~2 day X-ray lag indicates a small accretion disk of the system, and the optical counterpart was not detected by OGLE and MOA during quiescence, which constrained it to be fainter than MI = 7.5 mag. There is a suspected short-time optical flare detected at MJD = 52583.5 without X-ray counterpart detected, this single flux increase may imply a magnetic loop reconnection in the outer disk as proposed by Zurita et al (2003). The observations cover all stages of the outburst, however, due to the low sensitivity of RXTE/ASM, we cannot conclude whether it is an optical precursor at the initial rise of the outburst.","We present the first set of numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron mergers that include spin precession effects and are evolved with multiple resolutions. Our simulations employ consistent initial data in general relativity with different spin configurations and dimensionless spin magnitudes $\sim 0.1$. They start at a gravitational-wave frequency of $\sim392$~Hz and cover more than $1$ precession period and about 15 orbits up to merger. We discuss the spin precession dynamics by analyzing coordinate trajectories, quasi-local spin measurements, and energetics, by comparing spin aligned, antialigned, and irrotational configurations. Gravitational waveforms from different spin configuration are compared by calculating the mismatch between pairs of waveforms in the late inspiral. We find that precession effects are not distinguishable from nonprecessing configurations with aligned spins for approximately face-on binaries, while the latter are distinguishable from a nonspinning configurations. Spin precession effects are instead clearly visible for approximately edge-on binaries. For the parameters considered here, precession does not significantly affect the characteristic postmerger gravitational-wave frequencies nor the mass ejection.

Vector Curvaton with varying Kinetic Function,On the gauge dependence of gravitational waves generated at second order from scalar perturbations,True,"A new model realisation of the vector curvaton paradigm is presented and analysed. The model consists of a single massive Abelian vector field, with a Maxwell type kinetic term. By assuming that the kinetic function and the mass of the vector field are appropriately varying during inflation, it is shown that a scale invariant spectrum of superhorizon perturbations can be generated. These perturbations can contribute to the curvature perturbation of the Universe. If the vector field remains light at the end of inflation it is found that it can generate substantial statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and bispectrum of the curvature perturbation. In this case the non-Gaussianity in the curvature perturbation is predominantly anisotropic, which will be a testable prediction in the near future. If, on the other hand, the vector field is heavy at the end of inflation then it is demonstrated that particle production is approximately isotropic and the vector field alone can give rise to the curvature perturbation, without directly involving any fundamental scalar field. The parameter space for both possibilities is shown to be substantial. Finally, toy-models are presented which show that the desired variation of the mass and kinetic function of the vector field can be realistically obtained, without unnatural tunings, in the context of supergravity or superstrings.","We revisit and clarify the gauge dependence of gravitational waves generated at second order from scalar perturbations. In a universe dominated by a perfect fluid with a constant equation-of-state parameter $w$, we compute the energy density of such induced gravitational waves in the Newtonian, comoving, and uniform curvature gauges. Huge differences are found between the Newtonian and comoving gauge results for any $w \,(\ge 0)$. This is always caused by the perturbation of the shift vector. Interestingly, the Newtonian and uniform curvature gauge calculations give the same energy density for $w>0$. In the case of $w=0$, the uniform curvature gauge result differs only by a factor from that of the comoving gauge, but deviates significantly from that of the Newtonian gauge. Our calculation is done analytically for $w=0$ and $w=1/3$, and our result is consistent with the previous numerical one.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Effective Theory of Non-Adiabatic Quantum Evolution Based on the Quantum Geometric Tensor,Controllable quantum spin precession by Aharonov-Casher phase in conducting ring,True,"We study the role of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) in the evolution of quantum systems. We show that all its components play an important role on the extra phase acquired by a spinor and on the trajectory of an accelerated wavepacket in any realistic finite-duration experiment. While the adiabatic phase is determined by the Berry curvature (the imaginary part of the tensor), the non-adiabaticity is determined by the quantum metric (the real part of the tensor) and allows to determine corrections in the regimes where Landau-Zener approach is inapplicable. The particular case of a planar microcavity in the strong coupling regime allows to extract the QGT components by direct light polarization measurements and to check their effects on the quantum evolution.","We investigate quantum spin transport in a structure of conducting ring, embedded in textured electric field, with two leads, and obtain an exact solution for the problem. The spin precession induced by the Aharonov-Casher phase is studied. It is shown that the spin-polarized current and its polarizability can be controlled by the electric field.

Bounds on Regge growth of flat space scattering from bounds on chaos,Hidden conformal symmetry for dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole and its gauged family,True,"We study four-point functions of scalars, conserved currents, and stress tensors in a conformal field theory, generated by a local contact term in the bulk dual description, in two different causal configurations. The first of these is the standard Regge configuration in which the chaos bound applies. The second is the `causally scattering configuration' in which the correlator develops a bulk point singularity. We find an expression for the coefficient of the bulk point singularity in terms of the bulk S matrix of the bulk dual metric, gauge fields and scalars, and use it to determine the Regge scaling of the correlator on the causally scattering sheet in terms of the Regge growth of this S matrix. We then demonstrate that the Regge scaling on this sheet is governed by the same power as in the standard Regge configuration, and so is constrained by the chaos bound, which turns out to be violated unless the bulk flat space S matrix grows no faster than $s^2$ in the Regge limit. It follows that in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the chaos bound applied to the boundary field theory implies that the S matrices of the dual bulk scalars, gauge fields, and gravitons obey the Classical Regge Growth (CRG) conjecture.","Motivated by advanced progress in the holographic theory between rotating black holes and CFT, we explore the conformal invariance on dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole and its gauged family. We consider a neutral massless scalar probe on the black holes' background within the low-frequency limit and exhibit that the solution space possesses $SL(2,R)\times SL(2,R)$ isometry. The periodic identification of the azimuthal angle corresponds to the spontaneous conformal symmetry breaking by temperatures $T_L,T_R$. Using the computation of the central charges on Ref. [25] that we recalculate by considering the contributions of all associated fields, we successfully derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy from Cardy entropy formula. Furthermore, we also calculate the absorption cross-section from gravity side for generic non-extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole and near-extremal gauged dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole. Our calculations show that those quantities are in a perfect match with the calculation from CFT. Therefore, our findings further support the duality between rotating black holes and CFTs.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Universal R-Matrix of Reductive Lie Algebras,Marginal Deformations of N=4 SYM from Open/Closed Twistor Strings,True,"The aim of the paper is to build a universal R-matrix for the multiparameter deformation of any reductive Lie algebra. Such deformations, formulated in the recent past by Truini and Varadarajan, have the property of universality in a certain class and are shown by the present paper to be quasitriangular Hopf algebras. In order to build the R-matrix we exploit the twisting method for introducing new parameters as well as for making the transition to the reductive case. The physical motivation behind this construction is in the theory of integrable models: we intend to use such R-matrix for building the associated quantum R-matrix and Lax operators with spectral as well as color parameters - the color parameters being provided by the eigenvalues of the central generators of the reductive Lie algebra in a given representation. In this letter we present only the explicit form of the universal R-matrix of reductive Lie algebras and postpone its application to a forthcoming paper.","We investigate how the marginal deformations of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (analysed in particular by Leigh and Strassler) arise within B-model topological string theory on supertwistor space CP(3|4). This is achieved by turning on a certain closed string background in the fermionic directions. Through a specific open/closed correlation function, this mode induces a correction to holomorphic Chern-Simons theory, corresponding to the self-dual part of the chiral operator added on the gauge theory side. The effect of the deformation is interpreted as non-anticommutativity between some of the odd coordinates of CP(3|4). Motivated by this, we extend the twistor formalism for calculating MHV amplitudes in N=4 SYM to these N=1 theories by introducing a suitable star product between the wavefunctions. We check that our prescription yields the expected results to linear order in the deformation parameter.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Positivity Bounds and the Massless Spin-2 Pole,Doubly Special Relativity versus $\kappa$-deformation of relativistic kinematics,True,"The presence of a massless spin-2 field in an effective field theory results in a $t$-channel pole in the scattering amplitudes that precludes the application of standard positivity bounds. Despite this, recent arguments based on compactification to three dimensions have suggested that positivity bounds may be applied to the $t$-channel pole subtracted amplitude. If correct this would have deep implications for UV physics and the Weak Gravity Conjecture. Within the context of a simple renormalizable field theory coupled to gravity we find that applying these arguments would constrain the low-energy coupling constants in a way which is incompatible with their actual values. This contradiction persists on deforming the theory. Further enforcing the $t$-channel pole subtracted positivity bounds on such generic renormalizable effective theories coupled to gravity would imply new physics at a scale parametrically smaller than expected, with far reaching implications. This suggests that generically the standard positivity bounds are inapplicable with gravity and we highlight a number of issues that impinge on the formulation of a three-dimensional amplitude which simultaneously satisfies the required properties of analyticity, positivity and crossing symmetry. We conjecture instead a modified bound that ought to be satisfied independently of the precise details of the high energy completion.","We argue that recently proposed by Amelino-Camelia et all [1,2] so-called doubly special relativity (DSR), with deformed boost transformations identical with the formulae for $\kappa$-deformed kinematics in bicrossproduct basis is a classical special relativity in nonlinear disguise. The choice of symmetric composition law for deformed fourmomenta as advocated in [1, 2] implies that DSR is obtained by considering nonlinear fourmomenta basis of classical Poincar\'{e} algebra and it does not lead to noncommutative space-time. We also show how to construct large two classes of doubly special relativity theories - generalizing the choice in [1,2] and the one presented by Magueijo and Smolin [3]. The older version of deformed relativistic kinematics, differing essentially from classical theory in the coalgebra sector and leading to noncommutative $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space is provided by quantum $\kappa$-deformation of Poincar\'e symmetries.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Valley-Contrasting Orbital Magnetic Moment Induced Negative Magnetoresistance,Ru$_{2-x}$Mn$_{1+x}$Al thin films,True,"The valley-contrasting orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons allows the lifting of valley degeneracy by an out-of-plane magnetic field. We demonstrate that this leads to negative magnetoresistance, utilizing a gapped two-dimensional multi-valley model as an example. An intuitive physical picture in terms of the increased carrier density from a magnetic gating effect is proposed for this negative magnetoresistance. In particular, giant negative magnetoresistance is achieved after one of the two valleys is depleted by the magnetic field. This new mechanism of negative magnetoresistance is argued to be relevant in ionic-liquid gated gapped graphene with small effective mass.","The cubic Heusler alloy Ru$_{2-x}$Mn$_{1+x}$Al is grown in thin film form on MgO and MgAl$_2$O$_4$ substrates. It is a highly spin-polarised ferrimagnetic metal, with weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Although structurally and chemically similar to $\text{Mn}_2\text{Ru}_x\text{Ga}$, it does not exhibit ferrimagnetic compensation, or large magneto galvanic effects.

Holographic microstate counting for AdS$_4$ black holes in massive IIA supergravity,Mach's principle and dark matter,True,"We derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a class of BPS black holes in the massive type IIA supergravity background AdS$_4 \times S^6$ from a microscopic counting of supersymmetric ground states in a holographically dual field theory. The counting is performed by evaluating the topologically twisted index of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter gauge theories in the large $N$ limit. The $\mathcal{I}$-extremization principle is shown to match the attractor mechanism for the near-horizon geometries constructed in the four-dimensional dyonic $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity, that arises as a consistent truncation of massive type IIA supergravity on $S^6$. In particular, our results prove that the imaginary part of the three-dimensional partition functions plays a crucial r\^ole in holography.","In this paper we entertain a Machian setting where local physics is non-locally affected by the whole Universe, taking the liberty to identify the local (``Newton's bucket'') with our visible Universe, and the whole Universe (Mach's ``fixed stars'') with the global Universe beyond our horizon. Crucially, we allow for the two to have different properties, so that we are beyond the traditional FRW setting. For definiteness we focus on theories where non-locality arises from evolution in the laws of physics in terms of spatially global time variables dual to the constants of Nature. Since non-local theories are foliation-dependent, the {\it local} (but not the global) Hamiltonian constraint is lost. This is true not only while non-locality is taking place, but also after it ceases: the local Hamiltonian constraint is only recovered up to a constant in time, keeping a memory of the integrated past non-locality. We show that this integration constant is equivalent to preserving the local Hamiltonian constraint and adding an extra fluid with the same cosmological properties as conventional pressureless dark matter. The equivalence breaks down in terms of clustering properties, with the new component attracting other matter, but not budging from its location. This is the ultimate ``painted-on'' dark matter, attracting but not being attracted, and nailing down a preferred frame.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Nonleptonic two-body weak decays of charmed baryons,Finite size of hadrons and Bose-Einstein correlations in $pp$ collisions at 7 TeV,True,"We systematically analyze the two-body nonleptonic weak decays of charmed baryons, employing the pole approximation in tandem with the $SU(3)_F$ symmetry. Leveraging the K\""orner-Patti-Woo theorem, we demonstrate a significant reduction in the number of free parameters. Within the general pole scenario, we successfully explain most of the experimental data of ${\bf B}_c^A \to {\bf B}_nP$, though some inconsistencies are detected and recommended for reexamination in future research. Assuming the dominance of low-lying intermediate baryons, we are able to make novel predictions for decay channels such as $\Omega_c^0 \to {\bf B}_n P$ and ${\bf B}_{cc}\to {\bf B}_c^{A,S} P$. Here, ${\bf B}_n$, ${\bf B}_{c}^A$, ${\bf B}_c^S$ and ${\bf B}_{cc}$ are the low-lying octet, antitriplet charmed, sextet charmed and doubly charmed baryons, respectively, and $P$ is the pseudoscalar meson. Our findings also reveal that the fitted effective Wilson coefficient ${\cal C}_+=0.469$ is notably smaller than the na\""ive expectation, and the low-lying pole scenario fails to account for ${\cal B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to n \pi^+ , \Xi^0 K^+)$ , despite consistencies with the soft meson limit. We further recommend the decay channel $\Xi_{cc}^+ \to \Xi_c^0 \pi^+ \to \Xi^- \pi^+\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$ for exploring evidence of $\Xi_{cc}^+$, estimating the branching fraction at $(1.1\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-3}$.

Investigation of the near-wake behaviour of a utility-scale wind turbine,Comparison of computational codes for direct numerical simulations of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection,True,"Super-large-scale particle image velocimetry and flow visualization with natural snowfall is used to collect and analyze multiple datasets in the near wake of a 2.5 MW wind turbine. Each dataset captures the full vertical span of the wake from a different perspective. Together, these datasets compose a three-dimensional picture of the near-wake flow, including the effect of the tower and hub and the variation of instantaneous wake expansion in response to changes in turbine operation. A region of high-speed flow is observed directly behind the hub, and a region of low-speed flow appears behind the tower. Additionally, the hub produces a region of enhanced turbulence in its wake while the tower reduces turbulence near the ground as it breaks up turbulent structures in the boundary layer. Analysis of the instantaneous wake behaviour reveals variations in wake expansion, and even periods of wake contraction, occurring in response to changes in the angle of attack and blade pitch gradient. This behaviour is found to depend on the region of operation of the turbine. These findings can be incorporated into wake models and advanced control algorithms for wind farm optimization and can be used to validate wind turbine wake simulations.","Computational codes for direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection are compared in terms of computational cost and quality of the solution. As a benchmark case, RB convection at $Ra=10^8$ and $Pr=1$ in a periodic domain, in cubic and cylindrical containers is considered. A dedicated second-order finite-difference code (AFID/RBflow) and a specialized fourth-order finite-volume code (Goldfish) are compared with a general purpose finite-volume approach (OpenFOAM) and a general purpose spectral-element code (Nek5000). Reassuringly, all codes provide predictions of the average heat transfer that converge to the same values. The computational costs, however, are found to differ considerably. The specialized codes AFID/RBflow and Goldfish are found to excel in efficiency, outperforming the general purpose flow solvers Nek5000 and OpenFOAM by an order of magnitude with an error on the Nusselt number $Nu$ below $5\%$. However, we find that $Nu$ alone is not sufficient to assess the quality of the numerical results: in fact, instantaneous snapshots of the temperature field from a near wall region obtained for deliberately under-resolved simulations using Nek5000 clearly indicate inadequate flow resolution even when $Nu$ is converged.

Evolution along the sequence of S0 Hubble types induced by dry minor mergers. II - Bulge-disk coupling in the photometric relations through merger-induced internal secular evolution,The First Billion Years project: dark matter haloes going from contraction to expansion and back again,True,"Galaxy mergers are considered as questionable mechanisms for the evolution of lenticular galaxies (S0's), on the basis that even minor ones induce structural changes that are difficult to reconcile with the strong bulge-disk coupling observed in the photometric scaling relations of S0's. We check if the evolution induced onto S0's by dry intermediate and minor mergers can reproduce their photometric scaling relations, analysing the bulge-disk decompositions of the merger simulations presented in Eliche-Moral et al. (2012). The mergers induce an evolution in the photometric planes compatible with the data of S0's, even in those ones indicating a strong bulge-disk coupling. The mergers drive the formation of the observed photometric relation in some cases, whereas they induce a slight dispersion compatible with data in others. Therefore, this evolutionary mechanism tends to preserve these scaling relations. In those photometric planes where the morphological types segregate, the mergers always induce evolution towards the region populated by S0's. The structural coupling of the bulge and the disk is preserved or reinforced because the mergers trigger internal secular processes in the primary disk that induce significant bulge growth, even although these models do not induce bars. Intermediate and minor mergers can thus be considered as plausible mechanisms for the evolution of S0's attending to their photometric scaling relations, as they can preserve and even strengthen any pre-existing structural bulge-disk coupling, triggering significant internal secular evolution (even in the absence of bars or dissipational effects). This means that it may be difficult to isolate the effects of pure internal secular evolution from those of the merger-driven one in present-day early-type disks (abridged).","We study the effect of baryons on the inner dark matter profile of the first galaxies using the First Billion Years simulation between z=16-6 before secular evolution sets in. Using a large statistical sample from two simulations of the same volume and cosmological initial conditions, one with and one without baryons, we are able to directly compare haloes with their baryon-free counterparts, allowing a detailed study of the modifications to the dark matter density profile due to the presence of baryons during the first billion years of galaxy formation. For each of the ~ 5000 haloes in our sample we quantify the impact of the baryons using eta, defined as the ratio of dark matter mass enclosed in 100 pc in the baryonic run to its counterpart without baryons. During this epoch of rapid growth of galaxies, we find that many haloes of these first galaxies show an enhancement of dark matter in the halo centre compared to the baryon-free simulation, while many others show a deficit. We find that the mean value of eta is close to unity, but there is a large dispersion, with a standard deviation of 0.677. The enhancement is cyclical in time and tracks the star formation cycle of the galaxy; as gas falls to the centre and forms stars, the dark matter moves in as well. Supernova feedback then removes the gas, and the dark matter again responds to the changing potential.

Renyi Entropies of Interacting Fermions from Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations,A Note on Lars Onsager and the Partition Functions of Cubic Lattice Models,True,"Entanglement measures such as the entanglement entropy have become an indispensable tool to identify the fundamental character of ground states of interacting quantum many-body systems. For systems of interacting spin or bosonic degrees of freedom much recent progress has been made not only in the analytical description of their respective entanglement entropies but also in their numerical classification. Systems of interacting fermionic degrees of freedom however have proved to be more difficult to control, in particular with regard to the numerical understanding of their entanglement properties. Here we report a generalization of the replica technique for the calculation of Renyi entropies to the framework of determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo simulations -- the numerical method of choice for unbiased, large-scale simulations of interacting fermionic systems.

Line Formation of Raman-Scattered He II $\lambda$ 4851 in an Expanding Spherical H I Shell in Young Planetary Nebulae,A cycle of measurements of the solar semidiameter with the astrolabe of Rio de Janeiro (1998-2009),True,"We investigate line formation of Raman-scattered He II at 4851 in an expanding neutral spherical shell that surrounds a point-like He II source located at the center. A new grid-based Monte Carlo code is used to take into consideration the H I density variation along each photon path. In the case of a monochromatic He II emission source, the resultant line profiles are characterized by an asymmetric double peak structure with a tertiary peak and a significant red tail that may extend to line centers of He II$\lambda$4859 and H$\beta$. The peak separation corresponds to the expansion velocity, which we consider is in the range $20-40{\rm\ km\ s^{-1}}$ in this work. Tertiary red peaks are formed as a result of multiple Rayleigh reflections at the inner surface of a hollow spherical shell of \ion{H}{1}. Due to a sharp increase of scattering cross section near resonance, the overall Raman conversion efficiency is significantly enhanced as the expansion speed increases. In the case of a He II line source with a Gaussian line profile with a full width at half maximum of $30 - 70{\rm\ km\ s^{-1}}$, we obtain distorted redward profiles due to increasing redward cross section of H I. A simple application to the young planetary nebula IC 5117 is consistent with a neutral shell expanding with a speed $\sim 30{\rm\ km\ s^{-1}}$.","The solar astrolabe at Observatorio Nacional has been doing a series of solar semidiameter measurements, extending from 1998 up to 2009, to a total of 21640 observations of the Sun. Using the data series it was established the solar radius variation along that period, as well as determining results about the change of the solar ellipticity. To the work in perspective, the measurements of the solar radius in the past four centuries are reviewed, followed by a more detailed account of the contemporaneous measurements. The deviations of the observed values from the true values caused by observational and instrumental effects are studied and the strategies used to derive the corresponding corrections are shown. The relationships linking the variation of the semidiameter and the relevant indexes of the solar activity are analyzed. Finally, the time series from Observatorio Nacional was enchained to all the other similar astrolabe series, from which the data were graciously confided to this work. Using such much longer combined data set it was established the long term behavior of the solar semidiameter along the last three solar cycles. The outcome is a strong correlation to the long period features of the solar activity described by the annual mean of sunspots count. Putting together the long term semidiameter variation and other solar evidences we point out the near approach of a deep minimum of sunspots.",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"Solar and stellar astrophysics focuses on white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variables.

Theoretical analysis of single-ion anisotropy in $d^3$ Mott insulators,Thermodynamics of the ferromagnetic phase transition in nearly half metallic CoS2 at high pressures,True,"An effective spin model for Mott insulators is determined by the symmetries involved among magnetic sites, electron fillings, and their interactions. Such a spin Hamiltonian offers insight to mechanisms of magnetic orders and magnetic anisotropy beyond the Heisenberg model. For a spin moment S bigger than 1/2, single-ion anisotropy is in principle allowed. However, for $d^3$ Mott insulators with large cubic crystal field splitting, the single-ion anisotropy is absent within the LS coupling, despite S = 3/2 local moment. On the other hand, preferred magnetic moment directions in $d^3$ materials have been reported, which calls for a further theoretical investigation. Here we derive the single-ion anisotropy interaction using the strong-coupling perturbation theory. The cubic crystal field splitting including $e_g$ orbitals, trigonal distortions, Hund's coupling, and spin-orbit coupling beyond the LS scheme are taken into account. For compressed distortion, the spin-orbit coupling at magnetic sites can favor either the easy-axis or the easy-plane while that of anions leads to easy-axis anisotropy. We apply the theory on $\rm{CrX}_3$ with X = Cl and I, and show the dependence of the single-ion anisotropy on the strength of the spin-orbit couplings of both magnetic and anion sites. Significance of the single-ion anisotropy in ideal two-dimensional magnets is also discussed.","The volume change and heat capacity at the ferromagnetic phase transition in CoS2 were measured at high pressures using X-rays generated by the Argonne synchrotron light source and by ac-calorimetry, respectively. The transition entropy, calculated on the basis of these experimental data, drops along the transition line due to quantum degradation, as required by Nernst law. The volume change increases strongly along the transition line, which is explained by specifics of the compressibility difference of coexisting phases that results from nearly half metallic nature of the ferromagnetic phase of CoS2.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Quantum criticality and correlations in the cuprate superconductors,Instability of the Non-Fermi-Liquid Fixed Point in the Dissipative Gauge Theory of Fermions (I)Impurity Effects,True,A description of the electronic correlations contained in the Hubbard model on the square-lattice perturbed by very weak three-dimensional uniaxial anisotropy in terms of the residual interactions of charge $c$ fermions and spin-neutral composite two-spinon $s1$ fermions is used to access further information on the origin of quantum critical behavior in the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. Excellent quantitative agreement with their anisotropic linear-$\omega$ one-electron scattering rate and normal-state linear-$T$ resistivity is achieved. Our results provide strong evidence that the normal-state linear-$T$ resistivity is indeed a manifestation of low-temperature scale-invariant physics.,"We study a dissipative gauge theory of nonrelativistic fermions in 2+1 dimensions at zero temperature by the Wilsonian renormalization-group method. In this theory, we incorporate in the fermion propagator a new term of the form $ i \kappa \cdot\sign(\omega)$ (where $\kappa$ is a parameter and $\omega$ is the fermion frequency), which is usually induced by impurity effects. In the previous papers, we studied this system for $\kappa = 0$, and showed that there exists a non-Fermi-liquid infrared fixed point. In this paper, we address the question whether this non-Fermi-liquid behavior remains stable or not in the presence of impurity effects, i.e., the $\kappa$ term. Our results show that the non-Fermi-liquid fixed point is unstable for $\kappa \neq 0$ and an effective gauge coupling constant tends to vanish at low energies. However, in intermediate energy scales, the behavior of correlation functions for $\kappa \neq 0$ is controlled by the non-Fermi-liquid fixed point at $\kappa=0$, i.e., a crossover phenomenon appears. Physical implications of this phenomenon are discussed.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Three orbital model for the iron-based superconductors,Static magnetic and ESR spectroscopic properties of the dimer-chain antiferromagnet BiCoPO$_5$,True,"The theoretical need to study the properties of the Fe-based high-T_c superconductors with reliable many-body techniques requires us to determine the minimum number of orbital degrees of freedom that will capture the physics of these materials. While the shape of the Fermi surface (FS) obtained with the local density approximation (LDA) can be reproduced by a two-orbital model, it has been argued that the bands that cross the chemical potential result from the strong hybridization of three of the Fe 3d orbitals. For this reason, a three-orbital Hamiltonian obtained with the Slater-Koster formalism by considering the hybridization of the As p orbitals with the Fe d_xz,d_yz, and d_xy orbitals is discussed here. This model reproduces qualitatively the FS shape and orbital composition obtained by LDA calculations for undoped pnictides when four electrons per Fe are considered. Within a mean-field approximation, its magnetic and orbital properties in the undoped case are described. With increasing Coulomb repulsion, four regimes are obtained: (1) paramagnetic, (2) magnetic (pi,0) spin order, (3) the same (pi,0) spin order but now including orbital order, and finally (4) a magnetic and orbital ordered insulator. The spin-singlet pairing operators allowed by the lattice and orbital symmetries are also constructed. It is found that for pairs of electrons involving up to diagonal nearest-neighbors sites, the only fully gapped and purely intraband spin-singlet pairing operator is given by Delta(k)=f(k)\sum_{alpha} d_{k,alpha,up}d_{-k,alpha,down} with f(k)=1 or f(k)=cos(k_x)cos(k_y) which would arise only if the electrons in all different orbitals couple with equal strength to the source of pairing.","We report a comprehensive study of the static susceptibility, high-field magnetization and high-frequency/high-magnetic field electron spin resonance (HF-ESR) spectroscopy of polycrystalline samples of the bismuth cobalt oxy-phosphate BiCoPO$_5$. This compound features a peculiar spin system that can be considered as antiferromagnetic (AFM) chains built of pairs of ferromagnetically coupled Co spins and interconnected in all three spatial directions. It was previously shown that BiCoPO$_5$ orders antiferromagnetically at $T_{\rm N} \approx 10$ K and this order can be continuously suppressed by magnetic field towards the critical value $\mu_0H_{\rm c} \approx 15$ T. In our experiments we find strongly enhanced magnetic moments and spectroscopic $g$ factors as compared to the expected spin-only values, suggesting a strong contribution of orbital magnetism for the Co$^{2+}$ ions. This is quantitatively confirmed by ab initio quantum chemical calculations. Within the AFM ordered phase, we observe a distinct field-induced magnetic phase transition. Its critical field rises to $\sim 6$ T at $T \ll T_{\rm N}$. The HF-ESR spectra recorded at $T\ll T_{\rm N}$ are very rich comprising up to six resonance modes possibly of the multimagnonic nature that soften towards the critical region around 6 T. Interestingly, we find that the Co moments are not yet fully polarized at $H_{\rm c}$ which supports a theoretical proposal identifying $H_{\rm c}$ as the quantum critical point for the transition of the spin system in BiCoPO$_5$ to the quantum disordered state at stronger fields.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Dust depleted inner disks in a large sample of transition disks through long-baseline ALMA observations,Observational signatures of the giant planets collisions,True,"Transition disks with large inner dust cavities are thought to host massive companions. However, the disk structure inside the companion orbit and how material flows toward an actively accreting star remain unclear. We present a high resolution continuum study of inner disks in the cavities of 38 transition disks. Measurements of the dust mass from archival Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations are combined with stellar properties and spectral energy distributions to assemble a detailed picture of the inner disk. An inner dust disk is detected in 18 of 38 disks in our sample. Of the 14 resolved disks, 9 are significantly misaligned with the outer disk. The near-infrared excess is uncorrelated with the mm dust mass of the inner disk. The size-luminosity correlation known for protoplanetary disks is recovered for the inner disks as well, consistent with radial drift. The inner disks are depleted in dust relative to the outer disk and their dust mass is uncorrelated with the accretion rates. This is interpreted as the result of radial drift and trapping by planets in a low $\alpha$ ($\sim 10^{-3}$) disk, or a failure of the $\alpha$-disk model to describe angular momentum transport and accretion. The only disk in our sample with confirmed planets in the gap, PDS 70, has an inner disk with a significantly larger radius and lower inferred gas-to-dust ratio than other disks in the sample. We hypothesize that these inner disk properties and the detection of planets are due to the gap having only been opened recently by young, actively accreting planets.","We consider observational signatures of the collisions and partial destructions of giant exoplanets at the chaotic stage of the planetary systems evolution. The rate of these collisions in the Galaxy is estimated to be ~0.01-1 per yr. In the inelastic collision with a small relative velocity and small impact parameter, the planets may sufficiently lose their kinetic energy and merge together. Otherwise, if the planet is experienced a shallow tangential collision, it flews safety away. At the same time, the planets loss some part of their gas envelopes during mutual collisions. Collisions of the giant planets must be accompanied also by the radiation of energy from the radio to optical bands. The optical and near UV flashes result from the collision heating of the planet surface layers. Additionally, the collision compression and collapse of the powerful magnetosphere of giant planets are possible, with a successive generation of the radio bursts. According to our estimations, the corresponding rate the radio bursts is ~0.01-1 bursts per year with the maximum spectral flux ~30mJy at the frequencies ~3GHz and with a duration of the each burst ~1.5 hours.

Results from the Atacama B-mode Search (ABS) Experiment,Supercal: Cross-Calibration of Multiple Photometric Systems to Improve Cosmological Measurements with Type Ia Supernovae,True,"The Atacama B-mode Search (ABS) is an experiment designed to measure cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization at large angular scales ($\ell>40$). It operated from the ACT site at 5190~m elevation in northern Chile at 145 GHz with a net sensitivity (NEQ) of 41 $\mu$K$\sqrt{\rm s}$. It employed an ambient-temperature sapphire half-wave plate rotating at 2.55 Hz to modulate the incident polarization signal and reduce systematic effects. We report here on the analysis of data from a 2400 deg$^2$ patch of sky centered at declination $-42^\circ$ and right ascension $25^\circ$. We perform a blind analysis. After unblinding, we find agreement with the Planck TE and EE measurements on the same region of sky. We marginally detect polarized dust emission and give an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r<2.3$ (95% cl) with the equivalent of 100 on-sky days of observation. We also present a new measurement of the polarization of Tau A and introduce new methods associated with HWP-based observations.","Current cosmological analyses which use Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations combine SN samples to expand the redshift range beyond that of a single sample and increase the overall sample size. The inhomogeneous photometric calibration between different SN samples is one of the largest systematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. To place these different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observations of a small sample of very bright flux standards on the $HST$ system. We propose a complementary method, called `Supercal', in which we use measurements of secondary standards in each system, compare these to measurements of the same stars in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) system, and determine offsets for each system relative to PS1, placing all SN observations on a single, consistent photometric system. PS1 has observed $3\pi$ of the sky and has a relative calibration of better than 5 mmag (for $\sim15<griz<21$ mag), making it an ideal reference system. We use this process to recalibrate optical observations taken by the following SN samples: PS1, SNLS, SDSS, CSP, and CfA1-4. We measure discrepancies on average of 10 mmag, but up to 35 mmag, in various optical passbands. We find that correcting for these differences changes recovered values for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, by on average $2.6\%$. This change is roughly half the size of current statistical constraints on $w$. The size of this effect strongly depends on the error in the $B-V$ calibration of the low-$z$ surveys. The Supercal method will allow future analyses to tie past samples to the best calibrated sample.",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"Instrumentation and methods for astrophysics focuses on detector and telescope design, experiment proposals.

Photoproduction of the charged charmoniumlike $Z_{c}^{+}(4200)$,Theory of hard probes in PbPb collisions,True,"In this work, inspired by the observation of charmoniumlike $Z_{c}^{+}(4200)$% , we study the photoproduction of charged charmoniumlike $Z_{c}^{+}(4200)$ with an effective Lagrangian approach and the Regge trajectories model. The numerical results indicate that the Reggeized treatment can lead to a lower total cross section of the $Z_{c}^{+}(4200)$ photoproduction and the peak position of cross section was moved to the higher energy point when the Reggeized treatment was added. {Moreover, using the data from the COMPASS experiment and presented theoretical predictions, an upper limit of the decay width of $Z_{c}(4200)\rightarrow J/\psi \pi $ is estimated.} The relevant results not only shed light on the further experiment of searching for the charmoniumlike $Z_{c}(4200)$ state via meson photoproduction, but also provide valuable informations for having a better comprehension of the nature of charmoniumlike $Z_{c}(4200)$ state.","The jet quenching phenomenon in heavy ion collisions provides a strong evidence of the modification of parton shower in the quark-gluon plasma. This contribution focuses on the hard probes of QGP using jets and summarizes the new theoretical progress of jet substructure modification studies using effective field theory techniques. We emphasize the important role of jet substructure observables as they probe various aspects of the jet formation mechanism and allow us to study the medium properties in great details. The precise calculations require the systematic resummation and consistently including medium modifications. Specifically, we discuss the calculations of jet shapes and cross sections in proton-proton and lead-lead collisions at the LHC using soft-collinear effective theory, with Glauber gluon interactions in the medium. In the end we present the comparison between our calculations and the recent measurements at the LHC with very good agreement.

Single-quasiparticle stability and quasiparticle-pair decay in YBa2Cu3O6.5 (Ortho II),Spin-polarized local density of states in the vortex state of helical p-wave superconductors,True,"We report results and analysis of time-resolved photoinduced reflectivity experiments on the cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O6.5. The sample, which has Tc=45 K, was characterized by a high degree of purity and Ortho II ordering. The change in reflectivity (Delta R) was induced and probed using pulses of 100 femtosecond duration and photon energy 1.55 eV from a Ti:Sapphire laser. We provide a detailed picture of the decay rate (gamma) of Delta R as a function of temperature T and pump intensity I. At low T, gamma decreases linearly with decreasing I, extrapolating to nearly zero in the limit that I tends to zero. At higher temperatures gamma has the same linear dependence, but with nonzero limit as I goes to zero. In the interpretation of these results we assume that Delta R is proportional to the nonequilibrium quasiparticle density created by the laser. From an analysis of the gamma vs. I we estimate beta, the coefficient of proportionality relating the quasiparticle decay rate to the density. The intercept of gamma vs. I yields the thermal equilibrium quasiparticle decay rate. In a discussion section, we argue that the quasiparticles induced by the laser occupy primarily states near the antinodal regions of the Brillouin zone. We explain the divergence of the lifetime as T and I both tend to zero as a consequence of momentum and energy conservation in electron-electron scattering. We discuss the significance of the measured value of beta (approximately 0.1 cm2/s) in terms of the electron-phonon interactions.","Properties of the vortex state in helical p-wave superconductor are studied by the quasi-classical Eilenberger theory. We confirm the instability of the helical p-wave state at high fields and that the spin-polarized local density of states M(E,r) appears even when Knight shift does not change. This is because the vorticity couples to the chirality of up-spin pair or down-spin pair of the helical state. In order to identify the helical p-wave state at low fields, we investigate the structure of the zero-energy M (E = 0, r) in the vortex states, and also the energy spectra of M (E, r).",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

Universal behavior of QCD amplitudes at high energy from general tools of statistical physics,Improved analysis of black hole formation in high-energy particle collisions,True,"We show that high energy scattering is a statistical process essentially similar to reaction-diffusion in a system made of a finite number of particles. The Balitsky-JIMWLK equations correspond to the time evolution law for the particle density. The squared strong coupling constant plays the role of the minimum particle density. Discreteness is related to the finite number of partons one may observe in a given event and has a sizeable effect on physical observables. Using general tools developed recently in statistical physics, we derive the universal terms in the rapidity dependence of the saturation scale and the scaling form of the amplitude, which come as the leading terms in a large rapidity and small coupling expansion.","We investigate formation of an apparent horizon (AH) in high-energy particle collisions in four- and higher-dimensional general relativity, motivated by TeV-scale gravity scenarios. The goal is to estimate the prefactor in the geometric cross section formula for the black hole production. We numerically construct AHs on the future light cone of the collision plane. Since this slice lies to the future of the slice used previously by Eardley and Giddings (gr-qc/0201034) and by one of us and Nambu (gr-qc/0209003), we are able to improve the prefactor estimates. The black hole production cross section increases by 40-70% in the higher-dimensional cases, indicating larger black hole production rates in future-planned accelerators than previously estimated.

Molecular beam epitaxy and defect structure of Ge (111)/epi-Gd2O3 (111) /Si (111) heterostructures,"Low-frequency Noise in Individual Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors with Top, Side and Back Gate Configurations: Effect of Gamma Irradiation",True,"Molecular beam epitaxy of Ge (111) thin films on epitaxial-Gd2O3/Si(111) substrates is reported, along with a systematic investigation of the evolution of Ge growth, and structural defects in the grown epilayer. While Ge growth begins in the Volmer-Weber growth mode, the resultant islands coalesce within the first 10 nm of growth, beyond which a smooth two-dimensional surface evolves. Coalescence of the initially formed islands results in formation of rotation and reflection microtwins, which constitute a volume fraction of less than 1 %. It is also observed that while the stacking sequence of the (111) planes in the Ge epilayer is similar to that of the Si substrate, the (111) planes of the Gd2O3 epilayer are rotated by 180 degree about the [111] direction. In metal-semiconductor-metal schottky photodiodes fabricated with these all-epitaxial Ge-on-insulator (GeOI) samples, significant suppression of dark current is observed due to the presence of the Gd2O3 epilayer. These results are promising for application of these GeOI structures as virtual substrates, or for realization of high-speed group-IV photonic components.","We report on the influence of low gamma irradiation (10^4 Gy) on the noise properties of individual carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistors (FETs) with different gate configurations and two different dielectric layers, SiO2 and Al2O3. Before treatment, strong generation-recombination (GR) noise components are observed. These data are used to identify several charge traps related to dielectric layers of the FETs by determining their activation energy. Investigation of samples with a single SiO2 dielectric layer as well as with two dielectric layers allows us to separate traps for each of the two dielectric layers. We reveal that each charge trap level observed in the side gate operation splits into two levels in top gate operation due to a different potential profile along the CNT channel. After gamma irradiation, only reduced flicker noise is registered in the noise spectra, which indicates a decrease of the number of charge traps. The mobility, which is estimated to be larger than 2x10^4 cm2V-1s-1 at room temperature, decreases only slightly after radiation treatment demonstrating high radiation hardness of the CNTs. Finally, we study the influence of Schottky barriers at the metal-nanotube interface on the transport properties of FETs analyzing the behavior of the flicker noise component.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Modulation origin of 1/f noise in two-dimensional hopping,Magneto-optical properties of Au upon the injection of hot spin-polarized electrons across Fe/Au(001) interfaces,True,"We show that 1/f noise in a two-dimensional electron gas with hopping conduction can be explained by the modulation of conducting paths by fluctuating occupancy of non-conducting states. The noise is sensitive to the structure of the critical hopping network, which is varied by changing electron concentration, sample size and temperature. With increasing temperature, it clearly reveals the crossover between different hopping regimes.","We demonstrate a novel method for the excitation of sizable magneto-optical effects in Au by means of the laser-induced injection of hot spin-polarized electrons in Au/Fe/MgO(001) heterostructures. It is based on the energy- and spin-dependent electron transmittance of Fe/Au interface which acts as a spin filter for non-thermalized electrons optically excited in Fe. We show that after crossing the interface, majority electrons propagate through the Au layer with the velocity on the order of 1 nm/fs (close to the Fermi velocity) and the decay length on the order of 100 nm. Featuring ultrafast functionality and requiring no strong external magnetic fields, spin injection results in a distinct magneto-optical response of Au. We develop a formalism based on the phase of the transient complex MOKE response and demonstrate its robustness in a plethora of experimental and theoretical MOKE studies on Au, including our ab initio calculations.

The strongest bounds on active-sterile neutrino mixing after Planck data,Multiple Soft Limits of Cosmological Correlation Functions,True,"Light sterile neutrinos can be excited by oscillations with active neutrinos in the early universe. Their properties can be constrained by their contribution as extra-radiation, parameterized in terms of the effective number of neutrino species N_ eff, and to the universe energy density today \Omega_\nu h^2. Both these parameters have been measured to quite a good precision by the Planck satellite experiment. We use this result to update the bounds on the parameter space of (3+1) sterile neutrino scenarios, with an active-sterile neutrino mass squared splitting in the range (10^{-5} - 10^2 ) eV^2. We consider both normal and inverted mass orderings for the active and sterile states. For the first time we take into account the possibility of two non-vanishing active-sterile mixing angles. We find that the bounds are more stringent than those obtained in laboratory experiments. This leads to a strong tension with the short-baseline hints of light sterile neutrinos. In order to relieve this disagreement, modifications of the standard cosmological scenario, e.g. large primordial neutrino asymmetries, are required.","We derive novel identities satisfied by inflationary correlation functions in the limit where two external momenta are taken to be small. We derive these statements in two ways: using background-wave arguments and as Ward identities following from the fixed-time path integral. Interestingly, these identities allow us to constrain some of the O(q^2) components of the soft limit, in contrast to their single-soft analogues. We provide several nontrivial checks of our identities both in the context of resonant non-Gaussianities and in small sound speed models. Additionally, we extend the relation at lowest order in external momenta to arbitrarily many soft legs, and comment on the many-soft extension at higher orders in the soft momentum.

Floquet edge solitons in modulated trimer waveguide arrays,High power spatial single-mode quantum cascade lasers at 8.9 $\mu$m,True,"We show that one-dimensional Floquet trimer arrays with periodically oscillating waveguides support two different and co-existing types of topological Floquet edge states in two different topological gaps in Floquet spectrum. In these systems nontrivial topology is introduced by longitudinal periodic oscillations of the waveguide centers, leading to the formation of Floquet edge states in certain range of oscillation amplitudes despite the fact that the structure spends half of the period in ``instantaneously'' nontopological phase, and only during other half-period it is ``instantaneously'' topological. Two co-existing Floquet edge states are characterized by different phase relations between bright spots in the unit cell -- in one mode these spots are in-phase, while in other mode they are out-of-phase. We show that in focusing nonlinear medium topological Floquet edge solitons, representing exactly periodic nonlinear localized Floquet states, can bifurcate from both these types of linear edge states. Both types of Floquet edge solitons can be stable and can be created dynamically using two-site excitations.","High performance of InP-based quantum cascade lasers emitting at $\lambda$ ~ 9$\mu$m are reported.

Disorder versus two transport lifetimes in a strongly correlated electron liquid,Current-induced spin torque resonance of a magnetic insulator,True,"We report on angle-dependent measurements of the sheet resistances and Hall coefficients of electron liquids in SmTiO3/SrTiO3/SmTiO3 quantum well structures, which were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on (001) DyScO3. We compare their transport properties with those of similar structures grown on LSAT [(La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O3]. On DyScO3, planar defects normal to the quantum wells lead to a strong in-plane anisotropy in the transport properties. This allows for quantifying the role of defects in transport. In particular, we investigate differences in the longitudinal and Hall scattering rates, which is a non-Fermi liquid phenomenon known as lifetime separation. The residuals in both the longitudinal resistance and Hall angle were found to depend on the relative orientations of the transport direction to the planar defects. The Hall angle exhibited a robust T2 temperature dependence along all directions, whereas no simple power law could describe the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistances. Remarkably, the degree of the carrier lifetime separation, as manifested in the distinctly different temperature dependences and diverging residuals near a critical quantum well thickness, was completely insensitive to disorder. The results allow for a clear distinction between disorder-induced contributions to the transport and intrinsic, non-Fermi liquid phenomena, which includes the lifetime separation.","Pure spin currents transport angular momentum without an associated charge flow. This unique property makes them attractive for spintronics applications, such as torque induced magnetization control in nanodevices that can be used for sensing, data storage, interconnects and logics. Up to now, however, most spin transfer torque studies focused on metallic ferromagnets, while magnetic insulators were largely ignored, in spite of superior magnetic quality factors. Here, we report the observation of spin torque-induced magnetization dynamics in a magnetic insulator. Our experiments show that in ultrathin magnetic insulators the spin torque induced magnetization dynamics can be substantially larger than those generated by the Oersted field.

A versatile method to generate multiple types of micropatterns,Hydrodynamics and multiscale order in confluent epithelia,True,"Micropatterning techniques have become an important tool for the study of cell behavior in controlled microenvironments. As a consequence, several approaches for the creation of micropatterns have been developed in recent years. However, the diversity of substrates, coatings and complex patterns used in cell science is so great that no single existing technique is capable of fabricating designs suitable for all experimental conditions. Hence, there is a need for patterning protocols that are flexible with regard to the materials used and compatible with different patterning strategies to create more elaborate setups. In this work, we present a versatile approach to micropatterning. The protocol is based on plasma treatment, protein coating, and a PLL-PEG backfill step, and produces homogeneous patterns on a variety of substrates. Protein density within the patterns can be controlled, and density gradients of surface-bound protein can be formed. Moreover, by combining the method with microcontact printing, it is possible to generate patterns composed of three different components within one iteration of the protocol. The technique is simple to implement and should enable cell science labs to create a broad range of complex and highly specialized microenvironments.","We formulate a hydrodynamic theory of confluent epithelia: i.e. monolayers of epithelial cells adhering to each other without gaps. Taking advantage of recent progresses toward establishing a general hydrodynamic theory of $p-$atic liquid crystals, we demonstrate that collectively migrating epithelia feature both nematic (i.e. $p=2$) and hexatic (i.e. $p=6$) order, with the former being dominant at large and the latter at small length scales. Such a remarkable multiscale liquid crystal order leaves a distinct signature in the system's structure factor, which exhibits two different power law scaling regimes, reflecting both the hexagonal geometry of small cells clusters, as well as the uniaxial structure of the global cellular flow. We support these analytical prediction with two different cell-resolved models of epithelia: i.e. the self-propelled Voronoi model and the multiphase field model, which both confirm existence of multiscale hexanematic order and highlight how different energy dissipation mechanisms affect the structure of the system across length scales.",Biological Physics,"Biological physics focuses on molecular biophysics, cellular biophysics, neurological biophysics, membrane biophysics, single-molecule biophysics, ecological biophysics, quantum phenomena in biological systems (quantum biophysics), theoretical biophysics, molecular dynamics/modeling and simulation, game theory, biomechanics, bioinformatics, microorganisms, virology, evolution, biophysical methods."
The loop gravity string,$D=4$ supergravity from the Maxwell-Weyl superalgebra,True,"In this work we study canonical gravity in finite regions for which we introduce a generalisation of the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term including the Immirzi parameter. We study the canonical formulation on a spacelike hypersuface with a boundary sphere and show how the presence of this term leads to an unprecedented type of degrees of freedom coming from the restoration of the gauge and diffeomorphism symmetry at the boundary. In the presence of a loop quantum gravity state, these boundary degrees of freedom localize along a set of punctures on the boundary sphere. We demonstrate that these degrees of freedom are effectively described by auxiliary strings with a 3-dimensional internal target space attached to each puncture. We show that the string currents represent the local frame field, that the string angular momenta represent the area flux and that the string stress tensor represents the two dimensional metric on the boundary of the region of interest. Finally, we show that the commutators of these broken diffeomorphisms charges of quantum geometry satisfy at each puncture a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=3$. This leads to a description of the boundary degrees of freedom in terms of a CFT structure with central charge proportional to the number of loop punctures. The boundary $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is recovered via the action of the $U(1)^3$ Kac-Moody generators (associated with the string current) in a way that is the exact analog of an infinite dimensional generalization of the Schwinger spin-representation. We finally show that this symmetry is broken by the presence of background curvature.","Abstract We present the construction of the first-order $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity action by gauging the Maxwell-Weyl superalgebra. The four-form lagrangian is constructed by using the curvatures of the algebra and the local scale invariance of the action is achieved through the introduction of a compensating scalar field. Finally, we find the generalized Einstein equation with a coordinate dependent cosmological term.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Linear Spin Wave Analysis for General Magnetic Orders in the Kondo Lattice Model,Decision making by Berry's flux,True,"We extend the formulation of the spin wave theory for the Kondo lattice model, which was mainly used for the ferromagnetic metallic state, to general magnetic orders including complex noncollinear and noncoplanar orders. The 1/S expansion is reformulated in the matrix form depending on the size of the magnetic unit cell. The noncollinearity and noncoplanarity of the localized moments are properly taken into account by the matrix elements of the para-unitary matrix used in the diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes type Hamiltonian for magnons. We apply the formulation within the linear spin wave approximation to a typical noncollinear case, the $120^{\circ}$ N{\'e}el order on a triangular lattice at half filling. We calculate the magnon excitation spectrum and the quantum correction to the magnitude of ordered moments as functions of the strength of the Hund's-rule coupling, $J_{\rm H}/t$. We find that the magnon excitation shows softening at $J_{\rm H}/t \simeq 2.9$, which indicates that the $120^{\circ}$ order is destabilized for smaller $J_{\rm H}/t$. On the other hand, we show that the $120^{\circ}$ order is stable in the entire range of $J_{\rm H}/t \gtrsim 2.9$, and, in the limit of $J_{\rm H}/t \to \infty$, the form of the spin wave spectrum approaches that for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, while the bandwidth is proportional to $t^2/J_{\rm H}$. The reduction of the ordered moment is smaller than that for the spin-only model, except in the vicinity of the softening.","Order by disorder is a decision making process for frustrated systems but often leads to simple answers. We study order by disorder in the kagome Kondo model known for its complexity seeking rich decision making capabilities. At half filling and large Kondo coupling to hopping ratio $J_K/t$, the full manifold of 120$^o$ kagome ground states are degenerate at second order in $t/J_K$. We show this degeneracy lifts at sixth order when a fermion can hop around a hexagon and feel the Berry flux induced by a given spin texture. Using Monte-Carlo we then seek the ground state of this sixth order Hamiltonian and find in a 4x4 unit cell system that a co-planar 2x4 unit cell order is selected over the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$, $q=0$ and cuboc1 states, a result that survives even in the thermodynamic limit. This state is selected for its SU(2) flux properties induced by the spin texture and is analogous to the integer quantum Hall effect. Given the existence of numerous quantum Hall plateaus in other systems, the existence of this 2x4 unit cell state suggests that complex decision making is possible on the manifold of 120$^o$ states and achievable in different kagome-Kondo models.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Entanglement in a holographic Schwinger pair with confinement,Varied Signature Splitting Phenomena in Odd Proton Nuclei,True,"We revisit the entanglement of a Schwinger pair created by external fields of arbitrary strength, using a holographic dual description of QCD. When external fields are strong in comparison to the string tension, the entanglement is geometrically tied to the Einstein-Rosen (ER) bridge in the bulk, and disappears when the pair production is not exponentially suppressed at the boundary. For moderate external fields, the entanglement is shown to follow from the geometrical interplay between the position of the ER bridge and the confining wall in the bulk. We clarify the physical nature of quantum entanglement in pair production, and connect it to the entropy of entanglement between the left- and right-moving fermions. In particular, we clarify the effect of real radiation off the produced particles on quantum entanglement of the pair.","Varied signature splitting phenomena in odd proton rare earth nuclei are investigated. Signature splitting as functions of $K$ and $j$ in the angular momentum projection theory is explicitly shown and compared with those of the particle rotor model. The observed deviations from these rules are due to the band mixings.

Mesoscopic density-operator in a uniform magnetic field,Theory of electrical spin-detection at a ferromagnet/semiconductor interface,True,"A self-consistent linear-response theory for a two-lead mesoscopic structure in Landauer's viewpoint for transport is developed. A density operator relevant in this viewpoint, in a uniform magnetic field is derived. It is shown that this operator differs from the one given in Kubo's viewpoint by a term that represents the self-consistent effects. Hence, a special emphasis is devoted to the diagonal master equation where an exact solution is obtained in the framework of elastic scattering theory.","We present a theoretical model that describes electrical spin-detection at a ferromagnet/semiconductor interface. We show that the sensitivity of the spin detector has strong bias dependence which, in the general case, is dramatically different from that of the tunneling current spin polarization. We show that this bias dependence originates from two distinct physical mechanisms: 1) the bias dependence of tunneling current spin polarization, which is of microscopic origin and depends on the specific properties of the interface, and 2) the macroscopic electron spin transport properties in the semiconductor. Numerical results show that the magnitude of the voltage signal can be tuned over a wide range from the second effect which suggests a universal method for enhancing electrical spin-detection sensitivity in ferromagnet/semiconductor tunnel contacts. Using first-principles calculations we examine the particular case of a Fe/GaAs Schottky tunnel barrier and find very good agreement with experiment.

Hybrid simulations of lateral diffusion in fluctuating membranes,Threading-Induced Dynamical Transition in Tadpole-Shaped Polymers,True,"In this paper we introduce a novel method to simulate lateral diffusion of inclusions in a fluctuating membrane. The regarded systems are governed by two dynamic processes: the height fluctuations of the membrane and the diffusion of the inclusion along the membrane. While membrane fluctuations can be expressed in terms of a dynamic equation which follows from the Helfrich Hamiltonian, the dynamics of the diffusing particle is described by a Langevin or Smoluchowski equation. In the latter equations, the curvature of the surface needs to be accounted for, which makes particle diffusion a function of membrane fluctuations. In our scheme these coupled dynamic equations, the membrane equation and the Langevin equation for the particle, are numerically integrated to simulate diffusion in a membrane. The simulations are used to study the ratio of the diffusion coefficient projected on a flat plane and the intramembrane diffusion coefficient for the case of free diffusion. We compare our results with recent analytical results that employ a preaveraging approximation and analyze the validity of this approximation. A detailed simulation study of the relevant correlation functions reveals a surprisingly large range where the approximation is applicable.","The relationship between polymer topology and bulk rheology remains a key question in soft matter physics. Architecture-specific constraints (or threadings) are thought to control the dynamics of ring polymers in ring-linear blends, which thus affects the viscosity to range between that of the pure rings and a value larger, but still comparable to, that of the pure linear melt. Here we consider qualitatively different systems of linear and ring polymers, fused together in ""chimeric"" architectures. The simplest example of this family is a ""tadpole""-shaped polymer - a single ring fused to the end of a single linear chain. We show that polymers with this architecture display a threading-induced dynamical transition that substantially slows chain relaxation. Our findings shed light on how threadings control dynamics and may inform design principles for chimeric polymers with topologically-tunable bulk rheological properties.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

About a class of exact string backgrounds,The gravitating perfect fluid-scalar field equations: quintessence and tachyonic,True,This model also known as chiral null model is a generalization of the gravitational wave and fundamental string background and is exact in the $\a'$ expansion. The reduction to 4 dimensions yields a stationary IWP solution which couples to 7 gauge fields (one gravi-photon and 6 matter gauge fields) and 4 scalars. Special cases are the Taub-NUT geometry and rotating black holes. These solutions possess a T-self-dual point where the black hole becomes massless. Discussing the S-duality we show that the Taub-NUT geometry allows an S-self-dual point and that the electric black hole corresponds to a magnetic black hole or an H-monopole. We could identify the massless black hole as $N_L=0$ and confirm the H-monopole as an $N_L=1$ string states.,"The system consisting of a self gravitating perfect fluid and scalar field is considered in detail. The scalar fields considered are the quintessence and ``tachyonic'' forms which have important application in cosmology. Mathematical properties of the general system of equations are studied including the algebraic and differential identities as well as the eigenvalue structure.

Densities of states in Fe-doped III-V semiconductors: a first-principles study,Singularities of Magnetic and Elastic Characteristics of La2/3Ba1/3MnO3: Analysis of Martensitic Kinetics,True,"The electronic structures of Fe-doped III-V semiconductors were studied by first-principles supercell calculation. It was found that their electronic structures are basically the same as those of Mn-doped ones except that the extra electron of Fe compared to Mn occupies either majority-spin $p$-$d$ hybridized antibonding states ($t_{a,\uparrow}$) or minority-spin $e$ states ($e_{\downarrow}$) and that the center of gravity of the $d$ partial density of states is higher for Fe than for Mn. The present calculations suggest that ferromagnetism appears when the $e_{\downarrow}$ states start to be occupied. The band splitting due to $s$-$d$ hybridization was found to be significantly smaller than the one due to $p$-$d$ hybridization. This indicates that the $s,p$-$d$ exchange interaction is not responsible for the high-temperature ferromagnetism of the Fe-doped ferromagnetic semiconductors even in $n$-type compounds.",A coordinated temperature behavior of magnetic susceptibility and internal friction has been observed in the La2/3Ba1/3MnO3 manganite in the temperature region of the crystal phase separation 5-340 K. Stepwise temperature behavior of the susceptibility of the single crystal sample and corresponding singular behavior of the internal friction in the polycrystalline manganite have been found.

Inhibition of the dynamical Casimir effect with Robin boundary conditions,Non-Abelian Black Holes and Catastrophe Theory II: Charged Type,True,"We consider a real massless scalar field in 3+1 dimensions satisfying a Robin boundary condition at a nonrelativistic moving mirror. Considering vacuum as the initial field state, we compute explicitly the number of particles created per unit frequency and per unit solid angle, exhibiting in this way the angular dependence of the spectral distribution. The well known cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions may be reobtained as particular cases from our results. We show that the particle creation rate can be considerably reduced (with respect to the Dirichlet and Neumann cases) for particular values of the Robin parameter. Our results extend for 3+1 dimensions previous results found in the literature for 1+1 dimensions. Further, we also show that this inhibition of the dynamical Casimir effect occurs for different angles of particle emission.","We reanalyze the gravitating monopole and its black hole solutions in the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system and we discuss their stabilities from the point of view of catastrophe theory. Although these non-trivial solutions exhibit fine and complicated structures, we find that stability is systematically understood via a swallow tail catastrophe. The Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m trivial solution becomes unstable from the point where the non-trivial monopole black hole appears.

Structural Dynamics of incommensurate Charge-Density Waves tracked by Ultrafast Low-Energy Electron Diffraction,Gap and pseudogap evolution within the charge-ordering scenario for superconducting cuprates,True,"We study the non-equilibrium structural dynamics of the incommensurate and nearly-commensurate charge-density wave phases in 1T-TaS$_2$. Employing ultrafast low-energy electron diffraction (ULEED) with 1 ps temporal resolution, we investigate the ultrafast quench and recovery of the CDW-coupled periodic lattice distortion. Sequential structural relaxation processes are observed by tracking the intensities of main lattice as well as satellite diffraction peaks as well as the diffuse scattering background. Comparing distinct groups of diffraction peaks, we disentangle the ultrafast quench of the PLD amplitude from phonon-related reductions of the diffraction intensity. Fluence-dependent relaxation cycles reveal a long-lived partial suppression of the order parameter for up to 60 picoseconds, far outlasting the initial amplitude recovery and electron-phonon scattering times. This delayed return to a quasi-thermal level is controlled by lattice thermalization and coincides with the population of zone-center acoustic modes, as evidenced by a structured diffuse background. The long-lived non-equilibrium order parameter suppression suggests hot populations of CDW-coupled lattice modes. Finally, a broadening of the superlattice peaks is observed at high fluences, pointing to a nonlinear generation of phase fluctuations.","We describe the spectral properties of underdoped cuprates as resulting from a momentum-dependent pseudogap in the normal state spectrum. Such a model accounts, within a BCS approach, for the doping dependence of the critical temperature and for the two-parameter leading-edge shift observed in the cuprates. By introducing a phenomenological temperature dependence of the pseudogap, which finds a natural interpretation within the stripe quantum-critical-point scenario for high-T_c superconductors, we reproduce also the T_c-T^* bifurcation near optimum doping. Finally, we briefly discuss the different role of the gap and the pseudogap in determining the spectral and thermodynamical properties of the model at low temperatures.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Geometric dephasing-limited Hanle effect in long-distance lateral silicon spin transport devices,"Magnetism of mixed quaternary Heusler alloys: (Ni,T)$_{2}$MnSn (T=Cu,Pd) as a case study",True,"Evidence of spin precession and dephasing (""Hanle effect"") induced by an external magnetic field is the only unequivocal proof of spin-polarized conduction electron transport in semiconductor devices. However, when spin dephasing is very strong, Hanle effect in a uniaxial magnetic field can be impossible to measure. Using a Silicon device with lateral injector-detector separation over 2 millimeters, and geometrically-induced dephasing making spin transport completely incoherent, we show experimentally and theoretically that Hanle effect can still be measured using a two-axis magnetic field.","The electronic properties, exchange interactions, finite-temperature magnetism, and transport properties of random quaternary Heusler Ni$_{2}$MnSn alloys doped with Cu- and Pd-atoms are studied theoretically by means of {\it ab initio} calculations over the entire range of dopant concentrations. While the magnetic moments are only weakly dependent on the alloy composition, the Curie temperatures exhibit strongly non-linear behavior with respect to Cu-doping in contrast with an almost linear concentration dependence in the case of Pd-doping. The present parameter-free theory agrees qualitatively and also reasonably well quantitatively with the available experimental results. An analysis of exchange interactions is provided for a deeper understanding of the problem. The dopant atoms perturb electronic structure close to the Fermi energy only weakly and the residual resistivity thus obeys a simple Nordheim rule. The dominating contribution to the temperature-dependent resistivity is due to thermodynamical fluctuations originating from the spin-disorder, which, according to our calculations, can be described successfully via the disordered local moments model. Results based on this model agree fairly well with the measured values of spin-disorder induced resistivity.",Other Condensed Matter,Other condensed matter in physics focuses on topics that fall outside the scope of more specific categories.
Is High-density Amorphous Ice Simply a 'Derailed' State along the Ice I to Ice IV Pathway?,Cleaving-temperature dependence of layered-oxide surfaces,True,"The structural nature of high-density amorphous ice (HDA), which forms through low-temperature pressure-induced amorphization of the 'ordinary' ice I, is heavily debated. Clarifying this question is not only important for understanding the complex condensed states of H$_2$O but also in the wider context of pressure-induced amorphization processes, which are encountered across the entire materials spectrum. We first show that ammonium fluoride (NH$_4$F), which has a similar hydrogen-bonded network to ice I, also undergoes a pressure collapse upon compression at 77 K. However, the product material is not amorphous but NH$_4$F II, a high-pressure phase isostructural with ice IV. This collapse can be rationalized in terms of a highly effective mechanism. In the case of ice I, the orientational disorder of the water molecules leads to a deviation from this mechanism and we therefore classify HDA as a 'derailed' state along the ice I to ice IV pathway.","The surfaces generated by cleaving non-polar, two-dimensional oxides are often considered to be perfect or ideal. However, single particle spectroscopies on Sr2RuO4, an archetypal non-polar two dimensional oxide, show significant cleavage temperature dependence. We demonstrate that this is not a consequence of the intrinsic characteristics of the surface: lattice parameters and symmetries, step heights, atom positions, or density of states. Instead, we find a marked increase in the density of defects at the mesoscopic scale with increased cleave temperature.

Stationary Spiral Structure and Collective Motion of the Stars in a Spiral Galaxy,Imprints of Discrete Space Time - A Brief Note,True,"Most fully developed galaxies have a vivid spiral structure, but the formation and evolution of the spiral structure are still an enigma in astrophysics. In this paper, according to the standard Newtonian gravitational theory and some observational facts, we derive an idealized model for spiral galaxy, and give a natural explanation to the spiral structure. We solve some analytic solutions to a spiral galaxy, and obtain manifest relations between density and speed. From the solution we get some interesting results: (I) The spiral pattern is a stationary or static structure of density wave, and the barred galaxy globally rotate around an axis at tiny angular speed. (II) All stars in the disc of a barred spiral galaxy move in almost circular orbits. (III) In the spiral arms, the speed of stars takes minimum and the stellar density takes maximum. (IV) The mass-energy density of the dark halo is compensatory for that of the disc, namely, it takes minimum in the spiral arms.

Feedback from Reorienting AGN Jets,High-resolution observations of the symbiotic system R Aqr. Direct imaging of the gravitational effects of the secondary on the stellar wind,True,"[abridged] Aims: We test the effects of re-orienting jets from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) on the intracluster medium in a galaxy cluster environment with short central cooling time. We investigate appearance and properties of the resulting cavities, and the efficiency of jets in providing near-isotropic heating to the cooling cluster core. Methods: We use numerical simulations to explore four models of jets over several active/inactive cycles. We keep the jet power and duration fixed, varying only the jet angle prescription. We track the total energy of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the cluster core over time, and the fraction of the jet energy transferred to the ICM, paying attention to where the energy is deposited. We also compare synthetic X-ray images of the simulated cluster to actual observations. Results: Jets whose re-orientation is minimal ($\lesssim 20^{\circ}$) typically produce conical structures of interconnected cavities, with the opening angle of the cones being $\sim 15-20^{\circ}$, extending to $\sim 300$ kpc from the cluster centre. Such jets transfer about $60\%$ of their energy to the ICM, yet they are not very efficient at heating the cluster core, as the jet energy is deposited further out. Jets that re-orient by $\gtrsim 20^{\circ}$ generally produce multiple pairs of detached cavities. Although smaller, these cavities are inflated within the central 50~kpc and are more isotropically distributed, resulting in more effective heating of the core. Such jets, over few hundreds Myr, can deposit up to $80\%$ of their energy where it is required. Consequently, these models come the closest to an heating/cooling balance and to mitigating runaway cooling of the core, even though all models have identical power/duration profiles. Additionally, the corresponding synthetic X-ray images exhibit structures closely resembling those seen in real cool-core clusters.","We have observed the symbiotic stellar system R Aqr, aiming to describe the gravitational interaction between the white dwarf (WD) and the wind from the Mira star, the key phenomenon driving the symbiotic activity and the formation of nebulae in such systems. We present high-resolution ALMA maps of the 12CO and 13CO J=3-2 lines, the 0.9 mm continuum distribution, and some high-excitation molecular lines in R Aqr. The maps, which have resolutions ranging between 40 milliarcsecond (mas) and less than 20 mas, probe the circumstellar regions at suborbital scales as the distance between the stars is ~ 40 mas. Our observations show the gravitational effects of the secondary on the stellar wind. The AGB star was identified in our maps from the continuum and molecular line data, and we estimated the probable position of the secondary from a new estimation of the orbital parameters. The (preliminary) comparison of our maps with theoretical predictions is surprisingly satisfactory and the main expected gravitational effects are directly mapped for the first time. We find a strong focusing in the equatorial plane of the resulting wind, which shows two plumes in opposite directions that have different velocities and very probably correspond to the expected double spiral due to the interaction. Our continuum maps show the very inner regions of the nascent bipolar jets, at scales of some AU. Continuum maps obtained with the highest resolution show the presence of a clump that very probably corresponds to the emission of the ionized surroundings of the WD and of a bridge of material joining both stars, which is likely material flowing from the AGB primary to the accretion disk around the WD secondary.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Spin-polarized electron transmission in DNA-like systems,Quantum Interference in Off-Resonant Transport through Single Molecules,True,"The helical distribution of the electronic density in chiral molecules, such as DNA and bacteriorhodopsin, has been suggested to induce a spin-orbit coupling interaction that may lead to the so-called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. Key ingredients for the theoretical modelling are, in this context, the helically shaped potential of the molecule and, concomitantly, a Rashba-like spin-orbit coupling due to the appearance of a magnetic field in the electron reference frame. Symmetries of these models clearly play a crucial role in explaining the observed effect, but a thorough analysis has been largely ignored in the literature. In this work, we present a study of these symmetries and how they can be exploited to enhance chiral-induced spin selectivity in helical molecular systems.","We provide a simple set of rules for predicting interference effects in off-resonant transport through single-molecule junctions. These effects fall in two classes, showing respectively an odd or an even number of nodes in the linear conductance within a given molecular charge state, and we demonstrate how to decide the interference class directly from the contacting geometry. For neutral alternant hydrocarbons, we employ the Coulson-Rushbrooke-McLachlan pairing theorem to show that the interference class is decided simply by tunneling on and off the molecule from same, or different sublattices. More generally, we investigate a range of smaller molecules by means of exact diag- onalization combined with a perturbative treatment of the molecule-lead tunnel coupling. While these results generally agree well with GW calculations, they are shown to be at odds with simpler mean-field treatments. For molecules with spin-degenerate ground states, we show that for most junctions, interference causes no transmission nodes, but argue that it may lead to a non-standard gate-dependence of the zero-bias Kondo resonance.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Numerical Investigation of Second Mode Attenuation over Carbon/Carbon Surfaces on a Sharp Slender Cone,Local vortex line topology and geometry in turbulence,True,"We have carried out axisymmetric numerical simulations of a spatially developing hypersonic boundary layer over a sharp 7$^{\circ{}}$-half-angle cone at $M_\infty=7.5$ inspired by the experimental investigations by Wagner (2015). Simulations are first performed with impermeable (or solid) walls with a one-time broadband pulse excitation applied upstream to determine the most convectively-amplified frequencies resulting in the range 260kHz -- 400kHz, consistent with experimental observations of second-mode instability waves. Subsequently, we introduce harmonic disturbances via continuous periodic suction and blowing at 270kHz and 350kHz. For each of these forcing frequencies complex impedance boundary conditions (IBC), modeling the acoustic response of two different carbon/carbon (C/C) ultrasonically absorptive porous surfaces, are applied at the wall. The IBCs are derived as an output of a pore-scale aeroacoustic analysis -- the inverse Helmholtz Solver (iHS) -- which is able to return the broadband real and imaginary components of the surface-averaged impedance. The introduction of the IBCs in all cases leads to a significant attenuation of the harmonically-forced second-mode wave. In particular, we observe a higher attenuation rate of the introduced waves with frequency of 350kHz in comparison with 270kHz, and, along with the iHS impedance results, we establish that the C/C surfaces absorb acoustic energy more effectively at higher frequencies.","The local streamline topology classification method of Chong et al. (1990) is adapted and extended to describe the geometry of infinitesimal vortex lines. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of forced isotropic turbulence reveals that joint probability density function (PDF) of the second ($q_\omega$) and third ($r_\omega$) normalized invariants of the vorticity gradient tensor asymptotes to a self-similar bell form beyond $Re_\lambda > 200$. The same PDF shape is also seen at the late stages of breakdown of Taylor-Green vortex suggesting the universality of the bell-shaped pdf form in turbulent flows. Additionally, vortex reconnection from different initial configurations is examined. The local topology and geometry of the reconnection bridge is shown to be identical in all cases with elliptic vortex lines on one side and hyperbolic filaments on the other.

Rapid generation of Mott insulators from arrays of noncondensed atoms,Immiscibile two-component Bose Einstein condensates beyond mean-field approximation: phase transitions and rotational response,True,"We theoretically analyze a scheme for a fast adiabatic transfer of cold atoms from the atomic limit of isolated traps to a Mott-insulator close to the superfluid phase. This gives access to the Bose-Hubbard physics without the need of a prior Bose-Einstein condensate. The initial state can be prepared by combining the deterministic assembly of atomic arrays with resolved Raman sideband cooling. In the subsequent transfer the trap depth is reduced significantly. We derive conditions for the adiabaticity of this process and calculate optimal adiabatic ramp shapes. Using available experimental parameters, we estimate the impact of heating due to photon scattering and compute the fidelity of the transfer scheme. Finally, we discuss the particle number scaling behavior of the method for preparing low-entropy states. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art technology.","We consider a two-component immiscible Bose-Einstein condensate with dominating intra-species repulsive density-density interactions. In the ground-state phase of such a system only one condensates is present. This can be viewed as a spontaneous breakdown of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We study the phase diagram of the system at finite temperature beyond mean-field approximation. In the absence of rotation, we show that the system undergoes a first order phase transition from this ground state to a miscible two-component normal fluid as temperature is increased. In the presence of rotation, the system features a competition between vortex-vortex interaction and short range density-density interactions. This leads to a rotation-driven ""mixing"" phase transition in a spatially inhomogeneous state with additional broken $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry. Thermal fluctuations in this state lead to nematic two-component sheets of vortex liquids. At sufficiently strong inter-component interaction, we find that the superfluid and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase transitions split. This results in the formation of an intermediate state which breaks only $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. It represents two phase separated normal fluids with density imbalance.",Quantum Gases,"Quantum gases in condensed matter physics focuses on ultracold atomic and molecular gases, Bose-Einstein condensation, Feshbach resonances, spinor condensates, optical lattices, quantum simulation with cold atoms and molecules, and macroscopic interference phenomena."
Dynamics of anisotropic oxygen-ion migration in strained cobaltites,Uniaxially stressed germanium with fundamental direct band gap,True,"Orientation control of oxygen vacancy channel (OVC) is a highly desirable for tailoring oxygen diffusion as it serves fast transport channel in ion conductors, which is widespread exploited in solid-state fuel cells, catalysts, and ion-batteries. Direct observation of oxygen-ions hopping towards preferential vacant sites is a key to clarifying migration pathways. Here we report the anisotropic oxygen-ion migration mediated by strain in ultrathin cobaltites via in-situ thermal activation in an atomic-resolved transmission electron microscopy. Oxygen migration pathways are constructed on the basis of the atomic structure during the OVC switching, which is manifested as the vertical-to-horizontal OVC switching under tensile strain, but the horizontal-to-diagonal switching under compression. We evaluate the topotactic structural changes to OVC, determine the crucial role of tolerance factor for OVC stability and establish the strain-dependent phase diagram. Our work provides a practical guide for engineering OVC orientation that is applicable ionic-oxide electronics.",We demonstrate the crossover from indirect- to direct band gap in tensile-strained germanium by temperature-dependent photoluminescence. The samples are strained microbridges that enhance a biaxial strain of 0.16% up to 3.6% uniaxial tensile strain. Cooling the bridges to 20 K increases the uniaxial strain up to a maximum of 5.4%. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence reveals the crossover to a fundamental direct band gap to occur between 4.0% and 4.5%.

Universal zero-bias conductance for the single electron transistor. II: Comparison with numerical results,Creep of Chiral Domain Walls,True,"A numerical renormalization-group survey of the zero-bias electrical conductance through a quantum dot embedded in the conduction path of a nanodevice is reported. The results are examined in the light of a recently derived linear mapping between the temperature-dependent conductance and the universal function describing the conductance for the symmetric Anderson model. A gate potential applied to the conduction electrons is known to change markedly the transport properties of a quantum dot side-coupled to the conduction path; in the embedded geometry here discussed, a similar potential is shown to affect only quantitatively the temperature dependence of the conductance. As expected, in the Kondo regime the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the mapped conductances. In the mixed-valence regime, the mapping describes accurately the low-temperature tail of the conductance. The mapping is shown to provide a unified view of conduction in the single-electron transistor.","Recent experimental studies of magnetic domain expansion under easy-axis drive fields in materials with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have shown that the domain wall velocity is asymmetric as a function of an external in plane magnetic field. This is understood as a consequence of the inversion asymmetry of the system, yielding a finite chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Numerous attempts have been made to explain these observations using creep theory, but, in doing so, these have not included all contributions to the domain wall energy or have introduced additional free parameters. In this article we present a theory for creep motion of chiral domain walls in the creep regime that includes the most important contributions to the domain-wall energy and does not introduce new free parameters beyond the usual parameters that are included in the micromagnetic energy. Furthermore, we present experimental measurements of domain wall velocities as a function of in-plane field that are well decribed by our model, and from which material properties such as the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the demagnetization field are extracted.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Collapsing Sub-Critical Bubbles,Angular Scaling in Jets,True,"In the standard scenario, the electroweak phase transition is a first order phase transition which completes by the nucleation of critical bubbles. Recently, there has been speculation that the standard picture of the electroweak phase transition is incorrect. Instead, it has been proposed that throughout the phase transition appreciable amounts of both broken and unbroken phases of $SU(2)$ coexist in equilibrium. I argue that this can not be the case. General principles insure that the universe will remain in a homogenous state of unbroken $SU(2)$ until the onset of critical bubble production.","We introduce a jet shape observable defined for an ensemble of jets in terms of two-particle angular correlations and a resolution parameter R. This quantity is infrared and collinear safe and can be interpreted as a scaling exponent for the angular distribution of mass inside the jet. For small R it is close to the value 2 as a consequence of the approximately scale invariant QCD dynamics. For large R it is sensitive to non-perturbative effects. We describe the use of this correlation function for tests of QCD, for studying underlying event and pile-up effects, and for tuning Monte Carlo event generators.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Integrable Superhierarchy of Discretized 2d Supergravity,Tachyon Condensates and Anisotropic Universe,True,The hierarchical nonlinear super-differential equations are identified which describe universal behavior of the discretized model of $2d$ supergravity recently proposed. This is done by first taking a double scaling limit of the super Virasoro constraints ( at finite $N$) of the model and by rederiving it from the $\tilde{G}_{-1/2}$ constraint and the two reduction of the super KP hierarchy discussed. The double-scaled constraints are found to be described by a twisted scalar and a Ramond fermion.,We investigate the cosmological solutions in closed bosonic string theory in the presence of non zero tachyon condensate. We specifically obtain time dependent solutions which describe an anisotropic universe.

Utilizing the Updated Gamma-Ray Bursts and Type Ia Supernovae to Constrain the Cardassian Expansion Model and Dark Energy,Leptogenesis in supersymmetry with one $L$ violating coupling,True,"We update gamma-ray burst (GRB) luminosity relations among certain spectral and light-curve features with 139 GRBs. The distance modulus of 82 GRBs at $z>1.4$ can be calibrated with the sample at $z\leq1.4$ by using the cubic spline interpolation method from the Union2.1 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) set. We investigate the joint constraints on the Cardassian expansion model and dark energy with 580 Union2.1 SNe Ia sample ($z<1.4$) and 82 calibrated GRBs data ($1.4<z\leq8.2$). In $\Lambda$CDM, we find that adding 82 high-\emph{z} GRBs to 580 SNe Ia significantly improves the constrain on $\Omega_{m}-\Omega_{\Lambda}$ plane. In the Cardassian expansion model, the best fit is $\Omega_{m}= 0.24_{-0.15}^{+0.15}$ and $n=0.16_{-0.52}^{+0.30}$ $(1\sigma)$, which is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology $(n=0)$ in the $1\sigma$ confidence region. We also discuss two dark energy models in which the equation of state $w(z)$ is parametrized as $w(z)=w_{0}$ and $w(z)=w_{0}+w_{1}z/(1+z)$, respectively. Based on our analysis, we see that our Universe at higher redshift up to $z=8.2$ is consistent with the concordance model within $1\sigma$ confidence level.",We have shown a new scenario of successful leptogenesis with one $L$ violating coupling and a relative Majorana phase playing the role of $CP$ violation. This is in contrast to the usual consideration of Feynman diagram with at least two $L$ violating couplings.

Locally non-geometric fluxes and missing momenta in M-theory,Anomalous Cyclic in the Neutrino Oscillations,True,"We use exceptional field theory to describe locally non-geometric spaces of M-theory of more than three dimensions. For these spaces, we find a new set of locally non-geometric fluxes which lie in the R-R sector in the weak-coupling limit and can typically be characterised by mixed symmetry tensors. These spaces thus provide new examples of non-geometric backgrounds which go beyond the NS-NS sector of string theory. Starting from twisted tori we construct duality chains that lead to these new non-geometric backgrounds and we show that, just as in the four-dimensional case, there are missing momenta associated to the mixed symmetry tensors.","Neutrino physics is one of the most important topics in particle physics and cosmology. Despite the many physical properties of neutrinos that are understood theoretically and experimentally, it is known that there are many unsolved problems in this area. In this study, we suppose that the deformed space-time caused by the gravitational perturbation can play an important role in neutrino oscillations. We analytically analyzed these effects on the neutrino oscillation and showed that this effect leads to an anomalous cyclic in the neutrino oscillation. The results clearly indicate that these anomalous cyclics depend on the degree of deformation of space-time. The role of this anomaly in neutrino oscillation may be important. There may be a relation between cyclic anomaly and other anomalies of neutrinos such as mass limits, energy limits, oscillation lengths, mixing angles, and speed of neutrinos. The cyclic anomalies might be detected experimentally. If these anomalies are confirmed, it will appear that we need to think more about neutrino physics.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Comparison of planetary H\alpha-emission models: A new correlation with accretion luminosity,Massive compact disks around FU Orionis-type young eruptive stars revealed by ALMA,True,"Accreting planets have been detected through their hydrogen-line emission, specifically H$\alpha$. To interpret this, stellar-regime empirical correlations between the H$\alpha$ luminosity $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ and the accretion luminosity $L_\mathrm{acc}$ or accretion rate $\dot{M}$ have been extrapolated to planetary masses, however without validation. We present a theoretical $L_\mathrm{acc}$--$L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ relationship applicable to a shock at the surface of a planet. We consider wide ranges of accretion rates and masses and use detailed spectrally-resolved, non-equilibrium models of the postshock cooling. The new relationship gives a markedly higher $L_\mathrm{acc}$ for a given $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ than fits to young stellar objects, because Ly-$\alpha$, which is not observable, carries a large fraction of $L_\mathrm{acc}$. Specifically, an $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ measurement needs ten to 100 times higher $L_\mathrm{acc}$ and $\dot{M}$ than previously predicted, which may explain the rarity of planetary H$\alpha$ detections. We also compare the $\dot{M}$--$L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ relationships coming from the planet-surface shock or implied by accretion-funnel emission. Both can contribute simultaneously to an observed H$\alpha$ signal but at low (high) $\dot{M}$ the planetary-surface shock (heated funnel) dominates. Only the shock produces Gaussian line wings. Finally, we discuss accretion contexts in which different emission scenarios may apply, putting recent literature models in perspective, and also present $L_\mathrm{acc}$--$L_\mathrm{line}$ relationships for several other hydrogen lines.","FU Orionis-type objects (FUors) are low-mass pre-main sequence stars undergoing a temporary, but significant increase of mass accretion rate from the circumstellar disk onto the protostar. It is not yet clear what triggers the accretion bursts and whether the disks of FUors are in any way different from disks of non-bursting young stellar objects. Motivated by this, we conducted a 1.3 mm continuum survey of ten FUors and FUor-like objects with ALMA, using both the 7 m array and the 12 m array in two different configurations to recover emission at the widest possible range of spatial scales. We detected all targeted sources and several nearby objects as well. To constrain the disk structure, we fit the data with models of increasing complexity from 2D Gaussian to radiative transfer, enabling comparison with other samples modeled in a similar way. The radiative transfer modeling gives disk masses that are significantly larger than what is obtained from the measured millimeter fluxes assuming optically thin emission, suggesting that the FUor disks are optically thick at this wavelength. In comparison with samples of regular Class II and Class I objects, the disks of FUors are typically a factor of 2.9-4.4 more massive and a factor of 1.5-4.7 smaller in size.

The evolution of Red Supergiants to supernova in the LMC cluster NGC 2100,A New Hybrid Technique for Modeling Dense Star Clusters,True,"The mass loss rates of red supergiants (RSGs) govern their evolution towards supernova and dictate the appearance of the resulting explosion. To study how mass-loss rates change with evolution we measure the mass-loss rates (\mdot) and extinctions of 19 red supergiants in the young massive cluster NGC2100 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. By targeting stars in a coeval cluster we can study the mass-loss rate evolution whilst keeping the variables of mass and metallicity fixed. Mass-loss rates were determined by fitting DUSTY models to mid-IR photometry from WISE and Spitzer/IRAC. We find that the \mdot\ in red supergiants increases as the star evolves, and is well described by \mdot\ prescription of de Jager, used widely in stellar evolution calculations. We find the extinction caused by the warm dust is negligible, meaning the warm circumstellar material of the inner wind cannot explain the higher levels of extinction found in the RSGs compared to other cluster stars. We discuss the implications of this work in terms of supernova progenitors and stellar evolution theory. We argue there is little justification for substantially increasing the \mdot\ during the RSG phase, as has been suggested recently in order to explain the absence of high mass Type IIP supernova progenitors. We also argue that an increase in reddening towards the end of the RSG phase, as observed for the two most evolved cluster stars, may provide a solution to the red supergiant problem.","The ""gravitational million-body problem,"" to model the dynamical evolution of a self-gravitating, collisional N-body system with ~10^6 particles over many relaxation times, remains a major challenge in computational astrophysics. Unfortunately, current techniques to model such systems suffer from severe limitations. A direct N-body simulation with more than 10^5 particles can require months or even years to complete, while an orbit-sampling Monte Carlo approach cannot adequately model the dynamics in a dense cluster core, particularly in the presence of many black holes. We have developed a new technique combining the precision of a direct N-body integration with the speed of a Monte Carlo approach. Our Rapid And Precisely Integrated Dynamics code, the RAPID code, statistically models interactions between neighboring stars and stellar binaries while integrating directly the orbits of stars or black holes in the cluster core. This allows us to accurately simulate the dynamics of the black holes in a realistic globular cluster environment without the burdensome N^2 scaling of a full N-body integration. We compare RAPID models of idealized globular clusters to identical models from the direct N-body and Monte Carlo methods. Our tests show that RAPID can reproduce the half-mass radii, core radii, black hole ejection rates, and binary properties of the direct N-body models far more accurately than a standard Monte Carlo integration while remaining significantly faster than a full N-body integration. With this technique, it will be possible to create more realistic models of Milky Way globular clusters with sufficient rapidity to explore the full parameter space of dense stellar clusters.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Field-enhanced critical parameters in magnetically nanostructured superconductors,Photoemission Evidence for a Remnant Fermi Surface and d-Wave-Like Dispersion in Insulating Ca2CuO2Cl2,True,"Within the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, we demonstrate the enhancement of superconductivity in a superconducting film, when nanostructured by a lattice of magnetic particles. Arrays of out-of-plane magnetized dots (MDs) extend the critical magnetic field and critical current the sample can sustain, due to the interaction of the vortex-antivortex pairs and surrounding supercurrents induced by the dots and the external flux lines. Depending on the stability of the vortex-antivortex lattice, a peak in the Hext-T boundary is found for applied integer and rational matching fields, which agrees with recent experiments [Lange et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 197006 (2003)]. Due to compensation of MDs- and Hext-induced currents, we predict the field-shifted jc-Hext characteristics, as was actually realized in previous experiment but not commented on [Morgan and Ketterson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 3614 (1998)].","An angle resolved photoemission study on Ca2CuO2Cl2, a parent compound of high Tc superconductors is reported. Analysis of the electron occupation probability, n(k) from the spectra shows a steep drop in spectral intensity across a contour that is close to the Fermi surface predicted by the band calculation. This analysis reveals a Fermi surface remnant even though Ca2CuO2Cl2 is a Mott insulator. The lowest energy peak exhibits a dispersion with approximately the |cos(kxa)-cos(kya)| form along this remnant Fermi surface. Together with the data from Dy doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8 + delta) these results suggest that this d-wave like dispersion of the insulator is the underlying reason for the pseudo gap in the underdoped regime.",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

Chern insulators without band inversion in MoS2 monolayers with 3d adatoms,Intergranular Hotspots: A Molecular Dynamics Study on the Influence of Compressive and Shear Work,True,"Electronic and topological properties of MoS2 monolayers endowed with 3d transition metal (TM) adatoms (V-Fe) are explored by using ab initio methods and k.p models. Without the consideration of the Hubbard U interaction, the V, Cr, and Fe adatoms tend to locate on the top of the Mo atoms, while the most stable site for the Mn atom is at the hollow position of the Mo-S hexagon. After the Hubbard U is applied, the most stable sites of all the systems become the top of the Mo atoms. Chern insulators without band inversion are achieved in these systems. The V and Fe adsorption systems are the best candidates to produce the topological states. The k.p model calculations indicate that these topological states are determined by the TM magnetism, the C3v crystal field from the MoS2 substrate, and the TM atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The special two-meron pseudospin texture is found to contribute to the topology. The apparent difference between the Berry curvatures for the V and Fe adsorption systems are also explored. Our results widen the understanding to the Chern insulators and are helpful for the applications of the MoS2 monolayers in the future electronics and spintronics.","Numerous crystal- and microstructural-level mechanisms are at play in the formation of hotspots, which are known to govern high explosive initiation behavior. Most of these mechanisms, including pore collapse, interfacial friction, and shear banding, involve both compressive and shear work done within the material and have thus far remained difficult to separate. We assess hotspots formed at shocked crystal-crystal interfaces using quasi-1D molecular dynamics simulations that isolate effects due to compression and shear. Two high explosive materials are considered (TATB and PETN) that exhibit distinctly different levels of molecular conformational flexibility and crystal packing anisotropy. Temperature and intra-molecular strain energy localization in the hotspot is assessed through parametric variation of the crystal orientation and two velocity components that respectively modulate compression and shear work. The resulting hotspots are found to be highly localized to a region within 5-20 nm of the crystal-crystal interface. Compressive work plays a considerably larger role in localizing temperature and intra-molecular strain energy for both materials and all crystal orientations considered. Shear induces a moderate increase in energy localization relative to unsheared cases only for relatively weak compressive shock pressures of approximately 10 GPa. These results help isolate and rank the relative importance of hotspot generation mechanisms and are anticipated to guide the treatment of crystal-crystal interfaces in coarse-grained models of polycrystalline high explosive materials.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Universal quark to gluon ratio in medium-induced parton cascade,Phase Transitions in the Early Universe (Is there a Strongly First Order Electroweak Phase Transition?),True,"We investigate the radiative break-up of a highly energetic quark or gluon in a high-temperature QCD plasma. Within an inertial range of momenta $T \ll \omega \ll E$, where $E$ denotes the energy of the original hard parton (jet) and $T$ the temperature of of the medium, we find that, as a result of the turbulent nature of the underlying parton cascade, the quark to gluon ratio of the soft fragments tends to a universal constant value that is independent of the initial conditions. We discuss implications of this result to jet quenching physics and the problem of thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions.","After some introductory remarks about the prospects of first order phase transitions in the early universe, we discuss in some detail the electroweak phase transition. In the standard model case a clear picture is arising including perturbative and nonperturbative effects. Since in this case the phase transition is not strongly first order as needed for baryogenesis, we discuss supersymmetric variants of the standard model, the MSSM with a light stop$_R$ and a NMSSM model where this can be achieved.

Optimizing microlens arrays for incoherent HiLo microscopy,Reflectionless and invisible potentials in photonic lattices,True,"HiLo microscopy is a powerful, low-cost, and easily configurable technique for acquiring high-contrast optically-sectioned images. However, traditional HiLo microscopes are based on coherent light sources with diffusive glass plates or incoherent light sources with digital mirror devices (DMD) and spatial light modulators (SLM), which are more expensive. Here, we propose a new low-cost HiLo microscopy technique using MLAs and incoherent LED light sources. We simulated structured illumination (SI) patterns and HiLo image generation based on Fresnel diffraction and incoherent imaging. To observe how MLAs affect HiLo images, we used three common MLAs with specific microlens pitch and numerical aperture (NA) to generate periodic illumination patterns. According to our simulations, using MLAs and incoherent light sources can enhance the image contrast compared with a traditional widefield fluorescence microscope. We found that the MLA NA does not significantly affect HiLo images. A larger lens pitch can bring a higher image contrast. However, there is an optimized lens pitch. If the lens pitch is too high, artefacts are observed in HiLo images. To our knowledge, this is the first numerical study about MLA-based HiLo microscopy. This study can benefit researchers using MLAs and incoherent light sources to configure their low-cost HiLo microscopes.","An arbitrarily-shaped optical potential on a discrete photonic lattice, which transversely drifts at a speed larger than the maximum one allowed by the light cone of the lattice band, becomes reflectionless. Such an intriguing result, which arises from the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice, is peculiar to discretized light and does not have any counterpart for light scattering in continuous optical media.

Analyzing epsilon'/epsilon in the 1/N_c Expansion,Relation between the pole and the minimally subtracted mass in dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction to three-loop order,True,"We present a recent analysis of epsilon'/epsilon in the 1/N_c expansion. We show that the 1/N_c corrections to the matrix element of Q_6 are large and positive, indicating a Delta I=1/2 enhancement similar to the one of Q_1 and Q_2 which dominate the CP conserving amplitude. This enhances the CP ratio and can bring the standard model prediction close to the measured value for central values of the parameters.",We compute the relation between the pole quark mass and the minimally subtracted quark mass in the framework of QCD applying dimensional reduction as a regularization scheme.

Majorana Neutrino Masses and Neutrino Oscillations,Radiative Corrections to Deep Inelastic Scattering in the Presence of an Additional Z' at LEP x LHC,True,"We examine some patterns of Majorana neutrino mass matrix which is compatible with the phenomenological lepton flavor mixing matrix and non-observation of neutrinoless double beta decay. Imposing $(M_{\nu})_{ee}=0$ for the Majorana neutrino mass matrix in the leading order, we obtain a relationship between the solar mixing angle and the neutrino masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. Additional possible texture zeros are assigned to the mass matrix so as for the nonvanishing $\theta_{13}$ to be predictable in terms of neutrino masses. We also show how three neutrino masses can be predicted from the solar mixing angle and the experimental results of $\Delta m^2_{sol}$ and $\Delta m^2_{atm}$ in this framework, and we discuss naturality of the forms of the mass matrix found in our work.","The study of ep-scattering at LEP x LHC offers an interesting opportunity to search for additional heavy neutral gauge bosons.

VLBI imaging of M81* at 3.4 mm with source-frequency phase-referencing,A Search for Laser Emission with Megawatt Thresholds from 5600 FGKM Stars,True,"We report on the first VLBI image of the M81 nucleus (M81*) at a wavelength of 3.4 mm, obtained with the source-frequency phase-referencing (SFPR) technique. Thanks to the SFPR calibration, the coherent integration time could be eventually increased by more than an order of magnitude, which enabled the detection of fringes at the level of 45 mJy beam-1 with a dynamic range higher than 130:1. This paves the way toward future mm/sub-mm VLBI observations of weaker sources. From the analysis of the M81* visibilities, a core size of ~50 uas at 3.4 mm was estimated. This follows the power-law relationship with wavelength lambda^0.88, reported previously at lower frequencies. These results constrain the core size (at 3.4 mm) to a minimum of ~80 Schwarzschild radii of M81*.","We searched high resolution spectra of 5600 nearby stars for emission lines that are both inconsistent with a natural origin and unresolved spatially, as would be expected from extraterrestrial optical lasers. The spectra were obtained with the Keck 10-meter telescope, including light coming from within 0.5 arcsec of the star, corresponding typically to within a few to tens of au of the star, and covering nearly the entire visible wavelength range from 3640 to 7890 angstroms.

We compute flux density detection thresholds for all wavelengths and spectral types sampled. Our detection thresholds for the power of the lasers themselves range from 3 kW to 13 MW, independent of distance to the star but dependent on the competing ""glare"" of the spectral energy distribution of the star and on the wavelength of the laser light, launched from a benchmark, diffraction-limited 10-meter class telescope. We found no such laser emission coming from the planetary region around any of the 5600 stars. As they contain roughly 2000 lukewarm, Earth-size planets, we rule out models of the Milky Way in which over 0.1 percent of warm, Earth-size planets harbor technological civilizations that, intentionally or not, are beaming optical lasers toward us. A next generation spectroscopic laser search will be done by the Breakthrough Listen initiative, targeting more stars, especially stellar types overlooked here including spectral types O, B, A, early F, late M, and brown dwarfs, and astrophysical exotica.",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"Instrumentation and methods for astrophysics focuses on detector and telescope design, experiment proposals.

Holographic energy loss in non-relativistic backgrounds,Charge-Ordered State versus Dimer-Mott Insulator at Finite Temperatures,True,"In this paper, we study some aspects of energy loss in non-relativistic theories from holography. We analyze the energy lost by a rotating heavy point particle along a circle of radius $l$ with angular velocity $\omega$ in theories with general dynamical exponent $z$ and hyperscaling violation exponent $\theta$. It is shown that this problem provides a novel perspective on the energy loss in such theories. A general computation at zero and finite temperature is done and it is shown that how the total energy loss rate depends non-trivially on two characteristic exponents $(z,\theta)$. We find that at zero temperature there is a special radius $l_c$ where the energy loss is independent of different values of $(\theta,z)$. Also at zero temperature, there is a crossover between a regime in which the energy loss is dominated by the linear drag force and by the radiation because of the acceleration of the rotating particle. We find that the energy loss of the particle decreases by increasing $\theta$ and $z$. We note that, unlike in the zero temperature, there is no special radius $l_c$ at finite temperature case.","We theoretically investigate the competition between charge-ordered state and Mott insulating state at finite temperatures in quarter-filled quasi-one-dimensional electron systems, by studying dimerized extended Hubbard chains with interchain Coulomb interactions. In order to take into account one-dimensional fluctuations properly, we apply the bosonization method to an effective model obtained by the interchain mean-field approximation. The results show that lattice dimerization, especially in the critical region, and frustration in the interchain Coulomb interactions reduce the charge-ordering phase transition temperature and enlarge the dimer-Mott insulating phase. We also derive a general formula of the Knight shift in the charge-ordered phase and its implication to experiments is discussed.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Metastable tight knots in a worm-like polymer,Thermodynamic Modelling of Phase Equilibrium in Nanoparticles-Nematic Liquid Crystals Composites,True,"Based on an estimate of the knot entropy of a worm-like chain we predict that the interplay of bending energy and confinement entropy will result in a compact metastable configuration of the knot that will diffuse, without spreading, along the contour of the semi-flexible polymer until it reaches one of the chain ends. Our estimate of the size of the knot as a function of its topological invariant (ideal aspect ratio) agrees with recent experimental results of knotted dsDNA. Further experimental tests of our ideas are proposed.","In this work, a theoretical study of phase equilibrium in mixtures of a calamitic nematic liquid crystal and hard spherical nanoparticles is presented. A mean-field thermodynamic model is used, where the interactions are considered to be proportional to the number of contacts, which in turn are proportional to the areas and area fractions of each component. It is shown that, as the radius of the particle is increased, the effect of the particles on the isotropic-nematic transition is less pronounced, and that for large radius the miscibility increases as the particle radius increases.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Spin dynamics in the Kapitza-Dirac effect,Electron spill-out effect on third-order optical nonlinearity of metallic nanostructure,True,"Electron spin dynamics in Kapitza-Dirac scattering from a standing laser wave of high frequency and high intensity is studied. We develop a fully relativistic quantum theory of the electron motion based on the time-dependent Dirac equation. Distinct spin dynamics, with Rabi oscillations and complete spin-flip transitions, is demonstrated for Kapitza-Dirac scattering involving three photons in a parameter regime accessible to future high-power X-ray laser sources. The Rabi frequency and, thus, the diffraction pattern is shown to depend crucially on the spin degree of freedom.","Over the last three decades, plasmonics using metallic nanostructures has become central to nanophotonics research. Recently, its targets have been extended to nonlinear optical phenomena. In a nonlinear regime, quantum mechanical effects, as exemplified by electron spill-out on the surface of nanostructures, significantly influence the optical response. Quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT) is a promising basis for the analysis of nonlinear optical responses involving such quantum mechanical effects. Herein, QHT was applied to calculate the third-order optical nonlinearity of a spherical metallic nanostructure.

Fourth-order QCD renormalization group quantities in the {\rm{V}}-scheme and the relation of the $\beta$-function to the Gell-Mann--Low function in QED,Gravitational waves of a first-order QCD phase transition at finite coupling from holography,True,"The semi-analytical $O(\alpha_s^4)$ expression for the renormalization group $\beta$-function in the ${\rm{V}}$-scheme is obtained in the case of the $SU(N_c)$ gauge group. In the process of calculations we use the existing information about the three-loop perturbative approximation for the QCD static potential, evaluated in the $\rm{\overline{MS}}$-scheme. The comparison of the numerical values of the third and fourth coefficients for the QCD RG $\beta$- functions in the gauge-independent ${\rm{V}}$- and $\rm{\overline{MS}}$-schemes and in minimal MOM scheme in the the Landau gauge is presented. The phenomenologically-oriented comparisons for the coefficients of $O(\alpha_s^4)$ expression for the $e^+e^-$-annihilation R-ratio in these schemes are presented. It is shown, that taking into account of these QCD contributions are of vital importance and lead to the drastic decrease of the scheme-dependence ambiguities of the fourth-order perturbative QCD approximations for the $e^+e^-$ annihilation R-ratio for the number of active flavours,$n_f=5$ in particular. We demonstrate that in the case of QED with $N$-types of leptons the coefficients of the $\beta^{\rm{V}}$-function are closely related to the ones of the Gell-Mann--Low $\Psi$-function and emphasise that they start to differ from each other at the fourth order due to the appearance of the extra $N^2$-contribution in the V-scheme. The source of this extra correction is clarified. The general all-order QED relations between the coefficients of the $\beta^{\rm{V}}$- and $\Psi$-functions are discussed.","We consider a holographic study of coupling dependent gravitational waves produced by the cosmic first order QCD phase transition at finite baryochemical potential. In the dual description, the first-order QCD phase transition corresponds to the first-order Hawking-Page phase transition in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. At intermediate coupling, we obtain key quantities characterizing the gravitational wave energy density spectrum. We then find that the gravitational waves might be detected for sufficiently large Gauss-Bonnet coupling, while sound waves play an important role in the spectrum. We also consider a supercooling scenario during the QCD phase transition and show that the gravitational waves generated during this period can be detected by pulsar timing array experiments.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Implicit infinite lattice summations for real space ab initio correlation methods,Towards efficient orbital-dependent density functionals for weak and strong correlation,True,"We suggest a local wave function based ab initio correlation method for infinite periodic systems, which can describe both the near range as well as the long range correlation effects coherently in the same scheme. Specifically, this work introduces a formalism which allows to describe the long range polarization cloud around a quasi particle in a solid explicitly in the formalism of local wave function based ab initio descriptions. To this end we reformulate the infinite lattice summation underlying the quantum chemistry formula to second order in a closed analytic form employing the elliptic theta function of the third kind. All formulas and manipulations are developed explicitely in full detail and a first numeric example demonstrates the principle idea. Good results for the long range polarization effects in LiH and LiF are found in agreement with earlier estimates.","We present a new paradigm for the design of exchange-correlation functionals in density-functional theory. Electron pairs are correlated explicitly by means of the recently developed second order Bethe-Goldstone equation (BGE2) approach. Here we propose a screened BGE2 (sBGE2) variant that efficiently regulates the coupling of a given electron pair. sBGE2 correctly dissociates H$_2$ and H$_2^+$, a problem that has been regarded as a great challenge in density-functional theory for a long time. The sBGE2 functional is then taken as a building block for an orbital-dependent functional, termed ZRPS, which is a natural extension of the PBE0 hybrid functional. While worsening the good performance of sBGE2 in H$_2$ and H$_2^{+}$, ZRPS yields a remarkable and consistent improvement over other density functionals across various chemical environments from weak to strong correlation.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

"FA2PbBr4: synthesis, structure and unusual optical properties of two polymorphs of formamidinium-based layered (110) hybrid perovskite",Optimal finite-range atomic basis sets for liquid water and ice,True,"Small cations such as guanidinium and cesium can act as templating cations to form low dimensional phases (2D, 1D, 0D) in the case of excess of organic halides. However, such phases with the widely used formamidinium (FA+) cation have not been reported so far. In this study, we discovered two novel low dimensional phases with a composition of FA2PbBr4 and investigated the prerequisites of their formation upon crystallization of FABr-excessive solutions of FAPbBr3. We found that both phases have the structure of (110) layered perovskite but are represented by two different polymorphs with eclipsed and staggered arrangement of adjacent layers. It was shown that FA2PbBr4 phases usually exist in a labile equilibrium with FAPbBr3 3D perovskite and can form composites with it. The optical properties of both polymorphs were comprehensively studied by means of absorption spectroscopy, diffuse reflection spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. DFT calculations were applied to investigate the band structure of the FA2PbBr4 and to corroborate the conclusions on their optoelectronic properties. As a result, we found that FA2PbBr4 phases irradiated by UV can exhibit effective green photoluminescence due to a transfer of excitation energy to defective states or 3D perovskite inclusions.","Finite-range numerical atomic orbitals are the basis functions of choice for several first principles methods, due to their flexibility and scalability. Generating and testing such basis sets, however, remains a significant challenge for the end user. We discuss these issues and present a new scheme for generating improved polarization orbitals of finite range. We then develop a series of high-accuracy basis sets for the water molecule, and report on their performance in describing the monomer and dimer, two phases of ice, and liquid water at ambient and high density. The tests are performed by comparison with plane-wave calculations, and show the atomic orbital basis sets to exhibit an excellent level of transferability and consistency. The highest-order bases (quadruple-zeta) are shown to give accuracies comparable to a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of at least ~1000 eV for quantities such as energy differences and ionic forces, as well as achieving significantly greater accuracies for total energies and absolute pressures.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

On insulating, multilayer NaCl films we control the charge state of organic molecules and resolve their structures in neutral, cationic, anionic and dianionic states by atomic force microscopy, obtaining atomic resolution and bond-order discrimination using CO functionalized tips. We detect changes in conformation, adsorption geometry and bond-order relations for azobenzene, tetracyanoquinodimethane and pentacene in multiple charge states. Moreover, for porphine we investigate the charge-state-dependent change of aromaticity and conjugation pathway in the macrocycle. This work opens the way to studying chemical-structural changes of individual molecules for a wide range of charge states.","We report a type of solar cells based on graphene/CdTe Schottky heterostructure, which can be improved by surface engineering as graphene is one-atomic thin.

"Goos-H\""{a}nchen Shifts of Partially Coherent Light Fields",Polarisation and Transparency of Relativistically Rotating Two-Level Atoms,True,"We investigate the Goos-H\""{a}nchen (GH) shifts of partially coherent fields (PCFs) by using the theory of coherence. We derive a formal expression for the GH shifts of PCFs in terms of Mercer's expansion, and then clearly demonstrate the dependence of the GH shift of each mode of PCFs on spatial coherence and beam width. We discuss the effect of spatial coherence on the resultant GH shifts, especially for the cases near the critical angles, such as totally reflection angle.","Electromagnetism and light-matter interaction in rotating systems is a rich area of ongoing research. We study the interaction of light with a gas of non-interacting two-level atoms confined to a rotating disk. We numerically solve the optical Bloch equations to investigate the how relativistic rotation affects the atoms' polarisation and inversion. The results are used to predict the steady-state stimulated emission seen by an observer at rest with the optical source in the laboratory frame. Competing physical effects due to time dilation and motion-induced detuning strongly modify solutions to the Bloch equations when the gas's velocity becomes relativistic. We account for the non-inertial motion by including acceleration-dependent excitation and emission rates, arising from a generalised Unruh effect. The effective thermal vacuum resulting from large accelerations de-polarises the gas while driving it towards population inversion, negating coherent driving due to the external light source. The results illustrate the intuitive, special-relativistic approach of assigning instantaneously comoving frames to understand non-inertial motion's influence when only local fields are physically significant.",Optics,Optics in physics focuses on adaptive optics.

Dynamical TAP approach to mean field glassy systems,Anomalous Heat Diffusion,True,"The Thouless, Anderson, Palmer (TAP) approach to thermodynamics of mean field spin-glasses is generalised to dynamics. A method to compute the dynamical TAP equations is developed and applied to the p-spin spherical model. In this context we show to what extent the dynamics can be represented as an evolution in the free energy landscape. In particular the relationship between the long-time dynamics and the local properties of the free energy landscape shows up explicitly within this approach. Conversely, by an instantaneous normal modes analysis we show that the local properties of the energy landscape seen by the system during its dynamical evolution do not change qualitatively at the dynamical transition.","Consider anomalous energy spread in solid phases, i.e., $MSD= \int (x -{< x >}_E)^2 \rho_E(x,t)dx \propto t^{\beta}$, as induced by a small initial excess energy perturbation distribution $\rho_{E}(x,t=0)$ away from equilibrium. The associated total thermal equilibrium heat flux autocorrelation function $C_{JJ}(t)$ is shown to obey rigorously the intriguing relation, $d^2 MSD/dt^2 = 2C_{JJ}(t)/(k_BT^2c)$, where $c$ is the specific volumetric heat capacity. Its integral assumes a time-local Helfand-moment relation; i.e. $ dMSD/dt|_{t=t_s} = 2/(k_BT^2c)\int_0^{t_s} C_{JJ}(s)ds$, where the chosen cut-off time $t_s$ is determined by the maximal signal velocity for heat transfer.

Phenomenological Estimation of Parameters in minimal Supergravity Model,Transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependences of $'\bm{Mach-like}'$ correlations for central Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV,True,"Several parameters of the minimal supergravity model are estimated by the method of the renormalization group. In this model, five arbitrary parameters $(m_0, m_{1/2}, \tan{\beta}, A_0, {sig}(\mu))$ are contained. $\tan{\beta}$ is evaluated as 7.5 by the likelihood analysis of the gauge and Yukawa coupling constants. Further, the trilinear coupling constant $A_0$ is fixed by the equation of $B_0=(A_0-1)m_0$ at the GUT scale $M_X \simeq 2\times10^{16}$(GeV) and by the Higgs potential at the Z-boson mass scale $M_Z=$91(GeV). As the results, (1) allowed $m_0-m_{1/2}$ regions, (2) the sparticle mass spectra, and (3) the lightest supersymmetric particle mass are shown in this paper.","The transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependences of partonic {`\it{Mach-like}'} shock wave have been studied by using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) with both partonic and hadronic interactions. The splitting parameter $D$, i.e. half distance between two splitting peaks on away side in di-hadron azimuthal angular ($\Delta\phi$) correlations, slightly increases with the transverse momentum of associated hadrons ($p^{assoc}_T$), which is consistent with preliminary experimental trend, owing to different interaction-lengths/numbers between wave partons and medium in strong parton cascade. On the other hand, the splitting parameter $D$ as a function of pseudorapidity of associated hadrons ($\eta^{assoc}$), keeps flat in mid-pseudorapidity region and rapidly drops in high-pseudorapidity region, which is as a result of different violent degrees of jet-medium interactions in the medium that has different energy densities in the longitudinal direction. It is proposed that the research on the properties of {`\it{Mach-like}'} correlation can shed light on the knowledge of both partonic and hadronic interactions at RHIC.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Study of Quasi-two-body $B_{(s)}\to \phi (f_0(980)/f_2(1270)\to)\pi\pi$ Decays in Perturbative QCD Approach,Testing new physics models by top charge asymmetry and polarization at the LHC,True,"In 2017, LHCb collaboration reported their first observation of the rare decays $B_s \to \phi (f_0(980)$ $/f_2(1270) \to ) \pi^+\pi^-$ and the evidence of $B^0 \to \phi(f_0(980)/f_2(1270)\to)\pi^+\pi^-$. Motivated by this, we study these quasi-two-body decays in the perturbative QCD approach. The branching fractions, $CP$ asymmetries and the polarization fractions are calculated. We find that within the appropriate two-meson wave functions, the calculated branching fractions are in agreement with the measurements of LHCb. Based on the narrow-width approximation, We also calculate the branching fractions of the quasi-two-body $B_{d,s}\to \phi(f_0(980)/f_2(1270)\to) \pi^0\pi^0$ and $B_{d,s}\to \phi(f_2(1270)\to) K^+K^-$, and hope the predictions to be tested in the ongoing LHCb and Belle II experiments. Moreover, the processes $B_{d,s}\to \phi f_2(1270)$ are also analyzed under this approximation. We note that the $CP$ asymmetries of these decays are very small, because these decays are either penguin dominant or pure penguin processes.","As a top quark factory, the LHC can test the new physics models used to explain the top quark forward-backward asymmetry A^t_FB measured at the Tevatron. In this work we perform a comparative study for two such models: the W'-model and the color triplet diquark (\phi) model. Requiring these models to explain A^t_FB and also satisfy the top pair production rate measured at the Tevatron, we examine their contributions to the LHC observables such as the polarization and charge asymmetry in top quark and W' (or \phi) productions. We find that these observables can be enhanced to the observable level and the current LHC measurement on the top charge asymmetry can already tightly constrain the W'-model. We also find that each observable shows different characteristics in different models, which can be utilized to discriminate the models.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Microscopic Property of Amorphous Semiconductor Metal Oxide InGaZnO$_{4}$ and Role of O-deficiency,Spatial Correlation at the Boson Peak Frequency in Amorphous Materials,True,"We investigated the microscopic and electronic structures amorphous oxide semiconductors InGaZnO$_{4}$ (a-IGZO) and the role of O-deficiency through the first-principle calculations. The structure of the amorphous oxide is complicated by the admixture of many different kinds of substructures, however it is surprisingly found that the band tail states, which are well-known to be present in the amorphous semiconductors, are few generated for the conduction band minimum (CBM). The electronic structure around CBM is little affected by the disorder and also by the O-deficiency. Free electron carriers can be generated without a creation of donor-level in the O-deficient amorphous oxide.","The Boson peak (BP), an excess of vibrational density of states, is ubiquitous for amorphous materials and is believed to hold the key to understanding the dynamics of glass and glass transition. Previous studies have established an energy scale for the BP, which is ~1-10 meV or ~THz in frequency. However, so far, little is known about the momentum dependence or spatial correlation of the BP. Here, we report the observation of the BP in model Zr-Cu-Al metallic glasses over a wide range of momentum transfer, using inelastic neutron scattering, heat capacity, Raman scattering measurements, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The BP energy is largely dispersionless; however, the BP intensity was found to scale with the static structure factor. Additional MD simulations with a generic Lennard-Jones potential confirmed the same. Based on these results, an analytical expression for the dynamic structure factor was formulated for the BP excitation. Further analysis of the simulated disordered structures suggests that the BP is related to local structure fluctuations (e.g., in shear strain).

Heart - Shaped Nuclei: Condensation of Rotational Aligned Octupole Phonons,Variational Calculation of Relativistic Meson-Nucleon Scattering In Zeroth Order,True,The strong octupole correlations in the mass region $A\approx 226$ are interpreted as rotation-induced condensation of octupole phonons having their angular momentum aligned with the rotational axis. Discrete phonon energy and parity conservation generate oscillations of the energy difference between the lowest rotational bands with positive and negative parity.

Using the particle representation of the scalar Wick-Cutkosky model this is done in lowest order of an expansion of the exact action around a retarded quadratic trial action. In particular, we evaluate the form factor for scattering of mesons from the scalar nucleon and determine the radius of the dressed particle. After analytic continuation to Minkowski space we study elastic meson-nucleon scattering both analytically and numerically near threshold and show that it is essential to incorporate the correct behaviour of the retardation function at large proper times.

ATLAS Commander: an ATLAS production tool,Global Analysis of the Higgs Candidate with Mass ~ 125 GeV,True,"This paper describes the ATLAS production tool AtCom (for ATLAS Commander). The purpose of the tool is to automate as much as possible the task of a production manager: defining and submitting jobs in large quantities, following up upon their execution, scanning log files for known and unknown errors, updating the various ATLAS bookkeeping databases on successful completion of a job whilst cleaning up and resubmitting otherwise. The design of AtCom is modular, separating the generic basic job management functionality from the interactions with the various databases on the one hand, and the computing systems on the other hand.

The CMS, ATLAS and Tevatron data are compatible with Standard Model couplings to massive gauge bosons and fermions, and disfavour several types of composite Higgs models unless their couplings resemble those in the Standard Model. We show that the couplings of the Higgs candidate are consistent with a linear dependence on particle masses, scaled by the electroweak scale ~ 246 GeV, the power law and the mass scale both having uncertainties ~ 20%.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Dynamic Rashba-Dresselhaus Effect,Parity Effects in Stacked Nanoscopic Quantum Rings,True,"The Rashba-Dresselhaus effect is the splitting of doubly degenerate band extrema in semiconductors, accompanied by the emergence of counter-rotating spin textures and spin-momentum locking. Here we investigate how this effect is modified by lattice vibrations. We show that, in centrosymmetric non-magnetic crystals, for which a bulk Rashba-Dresselhaus effect is symmetry-forbidden, electron-phonon interactions can induce a phonon-assisted, dynamic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting in the presence of an out-of-equilibrium phonon population. In particular, we show how Rashba, Dresselhaus, or Weyl spin textures can selectively be established by driving coherent infrared-active phonons, and we perform ab initio calculations to quantify this effect for halide perovskites.","The ground state and the dielectric response of stacked quantum rings are investigated in the presence of an applied magnetic field along the ring axis. For odd number $N$ of rings and an electric field perpendicular to the axis, a linear Stark effect occurs at distinct values of the magnetic field. At those fields energy levels cross in the absence of electric field. For even values of $N$ a quadratic Stark effect is expected in all cases, but the induced electric polarization is discontinuous at those special magnetic fields.

Mapping the Diversity of Galaxy Spectra with Deep Unsupervised Machine Learning,The 300 pc resolution imaging of a z = 8.31 galaxy: Turbulent ionized gas and potential stellar feedback 600 million years after the Big Bang,True,"Modern spectroscopic surveys of galaxies such as MaNGA consist of millions of diverse spectra covering different regions of thousands of galaxies. We propose and implement a deep unsupervised machine learning method to summarize the entire diversity of MaNGA spectra onto a 15x15 map (DESOM-1), where neighbouring points on the map represent similar spectra. We demonstrate our method as an alternative to conventional full spectral fitting for deriving physical quantities, as well as their full probability distributions, much more efficiently than traditional resource-intensive Bayesian methods. Since spectra are grouped by similarity, the distribution of spectra onto the map for a single galaxy, i.e., its ""fingerprint"", reveals the presence of distinct stellar populations within the galaxy indicating smoother or episodic star-formation histories. We further map the diversity of galaxy fingerprints onto a second map (DESOM-2). Using galaxy images and independent measures of galaxy morphology, we confirm that galaxies with similar fingerprints have similar morphologies and inclination angles. Since morphological information was not used in the mapping algorithm, relating galaxy morphology to the star-formation histories encoded in the fingerprints is one example of how the DESOM maps can be used to make scientific inferences.","We present the results of 300 pc resolution ALMA imaging of the [OIII] 88 $\mu$m line and dust continuum emission from a $z = 8.312$ Lyman break galaxy MACS0416_Y1. The velocity-integrated [OIII] emission has three peaks which are likely associated with three young stellar clumps of MACS0416_Y1, while the channel map shows a complicated velocity structure with little indication of a global velocity gradient unlike what was found in [CII] 158 $\mu$m at a larger scale, suggesting random bulk motion of ionized gas clouds inside the galaxy. In contrast, dust emission appears as two individual clumps apparently separating or bridging the [OIII]/stellar clumps. The cross correlation coefficient between dust and ultraviolet-related emission (i.e., [OIII] and ultraviolet continuum) is unity on a galactic scale, while it drops at < 1 kpc, suggesting well mixed geometry of multi-phase interstellar media on sub-kpc scales. If the cutoff scale characterizes different stages of star formation, the cutoff scale can be explained by gravitational instability of turbulent gas. We also report on a kpc-scale off-center cavity embedded in the dust continuum image. This could be a superbubble producing galactic-scale outflows, since the energy injection from the 4 Myr starburst suggested by a spectral energy distribution analysis is large enough to push the surrounding media creating a kpc-scale cavity.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Video Observation of Geminid 2010 from India using a portable system,FISH: A 3D parallel MHD code for astrophysical applications,True,"Visual observations of meteor showers have been carried out for many decades by astronomers. Modern developments in imaging systems have advanced our knowledge about the shower dynamics and their origin. We have made an attempt to make a portable video recording system to observe meteor showers. The system consists of a camera capable of recording the rapid motion of meteors entering the Earths atmosphere. The camera is interfaced with a laptop using an open source software like VirtualDub. The initial testing was carried out while observing Geminid meteor shower in December, 2010 from the base of Mahuli fort (Lat: $19.47{\deg}$ N, Long: $73.26{\deg}$ E) near Asangaon, India. Here, we present few of the meteors recorded during this event, followed by a preliminary analysis of the shower. The portable video recording system enables to capture meteors at a remote location. This system will strengthen traditional visual observation methods used by astronomers in India. Future coordinated studies with a multi-station approach using such systems will assist in deriving the parameters associated with meteor shower activity and its impact on the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, we propose long term and simultaneous multi-station video observations in the Indian subcontinent for continuous monitoring and better understanding of meteor dynamics.","FISH is a fast and simple ideal magneto-hydrodynamics code that scales to ~10 000 processes for a Cartesian computational domain of ~1000^3 cells. The simplicity of FISH has been achieved by the rigorous application of the operator splitting technique, while second order accuracy is maintained by the symmetric ordering of the operators. Between directional sweeps, the three-dimensional data is rotated in memory so that the sweep is always performed in a cache-efficient way along the direction of contiguous memory. Hence, the code only requires a one-dimensional description of the conservation equations to be solved. This approach also enable an elegant novel parallelisation of the code that is based on persistent communications with MPI for cubic domain decomposition on machines with distributed memory. This scheme is then combined with an additional OpenMP parallelisation of different sweeps that can take advantage of clusters of shared memory. We document the detailed implementation of a second order TVD advection scheme based on flux reconstruction. The magnetic fields are evolved by a constrained transport scheme. We show that the subtraction of a simple estimate of the hydrostatic gradient from the total gradients can significantly reduce the dissipation of the advection scheme in simulations of gravitationally bound hydrostatic objects. Through its simplicity and efficiency, FISH is as well-suited for hydrodynamics classes as for large-scale astrophysical simulations on high-performance computer clusters.

A fluctuation theorem for currents and non-linear response coefficients,Microscopic Activated Dynamics Theory of the Shear Rheology and Stress Overshoot in Ultra-Dense Glass-Forming Fluids and Colloidal Suspensions,True,"We use a recently proved fluctuation theorem for the currents to develop the response theory of nonequilibrium phenomena. In this framework, expressions for the response coefficients of the currents at arbitrary orders in the thermodynamic forces or affinities are obtained in terms of the fluctuations of the cumulative currents and remarkable relations are obtained which are the consequences of microreversibility beyond Onsager reciprocity relations.","We formulate a microscopic, force-level, activated dynamics-based statistical-mechanical theory for the continuous startup nonlinear shear-rheology of ultra-dense glass-forming hard-sphere fluids and colloidal suspensions in the context of the ECNLE approach. Activated structural relaxation is described as a coupled local-nonlocal event involving caging and longer-range collective elasticity which controls the characteristic stress relaxation time. Theoretical predictions for the deformation-induced mobility enhancement, onset of relaxation acceleration at low values of stress, strain, or shear-rate, apparent power-law thinning of the steady-state structural relaxation time and viscosity, a non-vanishing activation barrier in the shear-thinning regime, an apparent Herschel-Bulkley form of the rate dependence of the steady-state shear stress, exponential growth of different measures of a dynamic yield or flow-stress with packing fraction, and reduced fragility and dynamic heterogeneity under deformation were previously shown to be in good agreement with experiment. The central new question addressed here is the defining feature of the transient response - the stress-overshoot. In contrast to the steady-state flow regime, understanding the transient response requires an explicit treatment of the coupled nonequilibrium evolution of structure, elastic modulus, and stress relaxation time. We formulate a new quantitative model for this aspect in a physically motivated and computationally tractable manner. Theoretical predictions for the stress-overshoot are shown to be in good agreement with experimental observations in the metastable ultra-dense regime of hard-sphere colloidal suspensions as a function of shear-rate and packing fraction, and accounting for deformation-assisted activated motion is crucial for both the transient and steady-state responses.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Formation and Reconnection of Three-dimensional Current Sheets with a Guide Field in the Solar Corona,The Hydrodynamic Origin of Neutron Star Kicks,True,"We analyze a series of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection in a model solar corona to study the effect of the guide field component on quasi-steady state interchange reconnection in a pseudostreamer arcade configuration. This work extends the analysis of \citet{Edmondson2010b} by quantifying the mass density enhancement coherency scale in the current sheet associated with magnetic island formation during the nonlinear phase of plasmoid-unstable reconnection. We compare the results of four simulations of a zero, weak, moderate, and a strong guide field, $B_{GF}/B_0 = \lbrace 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 \rbrace$, to quantify the plasmoid density enhancement's longitudinal and transverse coherency scales as a function of the guide field strength. We derive these coherency scales from autocorrelation and wavelet analyses, and demonstrate how these scales may be used to interpret the density enhancement fluctuation's Fourier power spectra in terms of a structure formation range, an energy continuation range, and an inertial range---each population with a distinct spectral slope. We discuss the simulation results in the context of solar and heliospheric observations of pseudostreamer solar wind outflow and possible signatures of reconnection-generated structure.","We present results from a suite of axisymmetric, core-collapse supernova simulations in which hydrodynamic recoil from an asymmetric explosion produces large proto-neutron star (PNS) velocities. We use the adaptive-mesh refinement code CASTRO to self-consistently follow core-collapse, the formation of the PNS and its subsequent acceleration. We obtain recoil velocities of up to 620 km/s at ~1 s after bounce. These velocities are consistent with the observed distribution of pulsar kicks and with PNS velocities obtained in other theoretical calculations. Our PNSs are still accelerating at several hundred km/s at the end of our calculations, suggesting that even the highest velocity pulsars may be explained by hydrodynamic recoil in generic, core-collapse supernovae.",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"Solar and stellar astrophysics focuses on white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variables.

Characterizing solute hydrogen and hydrides in pure and alloyed titanium at the atomic scale,Prediction of Macrobending and Splice Losses for Photonic Crystal Fibers based on the Effective Index Method,True,"Ti has a high affinity for hydrogen and is a typical hydride formers. Ti-hydride are brittle phases which probably cause premature failure of Ti-alloys. Here, we used atom probe tomography and electron microscopy to investigate the hydrogen distribution in a set of specimens of commercially pure Ti, model and commercial Ti-alloys. Although likely partly introduced during specimen preparation with the focused-ion beam, we show formation of Ti-hydrides along {\alpha} grain boundaries and {\alpha}/\b{eta} phase boundaries in commercial pure Ti and {\alpha}+\b{eta} binary model alloys. No hydrides are observed in the {\alpha} phase in alloys with Al addition or quenched-in Mo supersaturation.","An index-guiding photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with an array of air holes surrounding the silica core region has special characteristics compared to conventional single-mode fibers (SMFs). Using the effective index method and the Gaussian beam propagation theory, the macro-bending and splice losses for PCFs are investigated. The wavelength dependence of the cladding index of the PCF has been taken properly into account. We obtain the effective spot size for different configurations of PCFs, which is used for computing the splice losses. The Gaussian approximation for the fundamental modal field leads to simple closed-form expressions for the splice losses produced by transverse, longitudinal and angular offsets.

We report the parameter constraints obtained via statistical analysis of cosmic observables namely, luminosity distance, BAO distance and lookback time measurement","We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to image one primary beam area at 3 GHz with 8 arcsec FWHM resolution and 1.0 microJy/beam rms noise near the pointing center. The P(D) distribution from the central 10 arcmin of this confusion-limited image constrains the count of discrete sources in the 1 < S(microJy/beam) < 10 range. At this level the brightness-weighted differential count S^2 n(S) is converging rapidly, as predicted by evolutionary models in which the faintest radio sources are star-forming galaxies; and ~96$% of the background originating in galaxies has been resolved into discrete sources. About 63% of the radio background is produced by AGNs, and the remaining 37% comes from star-forming galaxies that obey the far-infrared (FIR) / radio correlation and account for most of the FIR background at lambda = 160 microns. Our new data confirm that radio sources powered by AGNs and star formation evolve at about the same rate, a result consistent with AGN feedback and the rough correlation of black hole and bulge stellar masses.

"Influence of material stretchability on the equilibrium shape of a M\""obius band",Near room temperature antiferromagnetic ordering with a potential low dimensional magnetism in AlMn$_2$B$_2$,True,"We use a discrete, lattice-based model for two-dimensional materials to show that M\""obius bands made with stretchable materials are less likely to crease or tear. This stems a delocalization of twisting strain that occurs if stretching is allowed. The associated low-energy configurations provide strategic target shapes for the guided assembly of nanometer and micron scale M\""obius bands. To predict macroscopic band shapes for a given material, we establish a connection between stretchability and relevant continuum moduli, leading to insight regarding the practical feasibility of synthesizing M\""obius bands from materials with continuum parameters that can be measured experimentally or estimated by upscale averaging. To take advantage of stretchability in the case of M\""obius bands made of graphene, DNA, and other effectively unstretchable materials, we develop and explore a novel architecture that uses the Chinese finger trap as a fundamental building block and imparts notable stretchability to otherwise unstretchable materials.","We present self flux growth and characterization of single crystalline AlMn$_2$B$_2$. It is an orthorhombic (space group Cmmm), layered material with a plate like morphology. The anisotropic bulk magnetization data, electrical transport and $^{11}$B nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) data revealed an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at 313 $\pm$ 2 K.

Double-winding Wilson loops and monopole confinement mechanisms,Quadrupole pressure and shear forces inside baryons in the large $N_c$ limit,True,"We consider ""double-winding"" Wilson loops in SU(2) gauge theory. These are contours which wind once around a loop $C_1$ and once around a loop $C_2$, where the two co-planar loops share one point in common, and where $C_1$ lies entirely in (or is displaced slightly from) the minimal area of $C_2$. We discuss the expectation value of such double-winding loops in abelian confinement pictures, where the spatial distribution of confining abelian fields is controlled by either a monopole Coulomb gas, a caloron ensemble, or a dual abelian Higgs model, and argue that in such models an exponential falloff in the sum of areas $A_1+A_2$ is expected. In contrast, in a center vortex model of confinement, the behavior is an exponential falloff in the difference of areas $A_2-A_1$. We compute such double-winding loops by lattice Monte Carlo simulation, and find that the area law falloff follows a difference-in-areas law. The conclusion is that even if confining gluonic field fluctuations are, in some gauge, mainly abelian in character, the spatial distribution of those abelian fields cannot be the distribution predicted by the simple monopole gas, caloron ensemble, or dual abelian Higgs actions, which have been used in the past to explain the area law falloff of Wilson loops.","We derive number of relations between quadrupole energy, elastic pressure, and shear force distributions in baryons using the large $N_c$ picture of baryons as chiral solitons. The obtained large $N_c$ relations are independent of particular dynamics and should hold in any picture in which the baryon is the chiral soliton. One of remarkable qualitative predictions of the soliton picture is the nullification of the tangential forces acting on the radial area element for any tensor polarisation of the baryon.

Bessel beams revisited: a generalized scheme to derive optical vortices,Room-temperature Continuous-wave Lasing from Monolayer Molybdenum Ditelluride with a Silicon Nanobeam Cavity,True,"The electromagnetic field of optical vortices is in most cases derived from vector and scalar potentials using either a procedure based on the Lorenz or the Coulomb gauge. The former procedure has been typically used to derive paraxial solutions with Laguerre-Gauss radial profiles, while the latter procedure has been used to derive full solutions of the wave equation with Bessel radial profiles. We investigate the differences in the derivation procedures applying each one to both Bessel and Laguerre-Gauss profiles. We show that the electromagnetic fields thus derived differ in the relative strength of electric and magnetic contributions. The new solution that arises from the Lorenz procedure in the case of Bessel beams restores a field symmetry that previous work failed to resolve. Our procedure is further generalized and we find a spectrum of fields beyond the Lorenz and Coulomb gauge types. Finally, we describe a possible experiment to test our findings.","Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide the most efficient optical gain materials and have potential for making nanolasers with the smallest gain media with lowest energy consumption. But lasing demonstrations based on TMDs have so far been limited to low temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the first room-temperature laser operation in the infrared wavelengths from a monolayer of molybdenum ditelluride on a silicon photonic-crystal nanobeam cavity. Our demonstration is made possible by a unique choice of TMD material with emission wavelength below silicon absorption, combined with the high Q-cavity design by silicon nanobeam. Lasing at 1132 nm is demonstrated at room-temperature pumped by a continuous-wave laser, with a threshold density at 6.6 W/cm2. The room-temperature linewidth of 0.202 nm is the narrowest with the corresponding Q of 5603, the largest observed for a TMD laser.

On the absolute value of the air-fluorescence yield,IVOA Recommendation: Maintenance of the list of UCD words Version 1.20,True,"The absolute value of the air-fluorescence yield is a key parameter for the energy reconstruction of extensive air showers registered by fluorescence telescopes. In previous publications, we reported a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the air-fluorescence generation that allowed the theoretical evaluation of this parameter. This simulation has been upgraded in the present work. As a result, we determined an updated absolute value of the fluorescence yield of 7.9+-2.0 ph/MeV for the band at 337 nm in dry air at 800 hPa and 293 K, in agreement with experimental values. We have also performed a critical analysis of available absolute measurements of the fluorescence yield with the assistance of our simulation.

Charm mass effects in bulk channel correlations,The nature of the Roberge-Weiss Transition in $N_f=2$ QCD with Wilson Fermions on $N_\tau=6$ lattices,True,"The bulk viscosity of thermalized QCD matter at temperatures above a few hundred MeV could be significantly influenced by charm quarks because their contribution arises four perturbative orders before purely gluonic effects. In an attempt to clarify the challenges of a lattice study, we determine the relevant imaginary-time correlator (of massive scalar densities) up to NLO in perturbation theory, and compare with existing data. We find discrepancies much larger than in the vector channel; this may hint, apart from the importance of taking a continuum limit, to larger non-perturbative effects in the scalar channel. We also recall how a transport peak related to the scalar density spectral function encodes non-perturbative information concerning the charm quark chemical equilibration rate close to equilibrium.","The finite temperature chiral and deconfinement phase transitions at zero density for light and heavy quarks, respectively, have analytic continuations to imaginary chemical potential. At some critical imaginary chemical potential, they meet the Roberge-Weiss transition between adjacent $Z(3)$ sectors. For light and heavy quarks, where the chiral and deconfinement transitions are first order, the transition lines meet in a triple point. For intermediate masses chiral or deconfinement transitions are crossover and the Roberge-Weiss transition ends in a second order point. At the boundary between these regimes the junction is a tricritical point, as shown in studies with $N_f=2,3$ flavors of staggered and Wilson quarks on $N_\tau=4$ lattices. Employing finite size scaling we investigate the nature of this point as a function of quark mass for $N_f=2$ flavors of Wilson fermions with a temporal lattice extent of $N_\tau=6$.

The calculated bandgaps fall within the visible region of the solar spectrum indicating these materials could absorb a significant amount of solar light. Density of states calculations show that the covalent character is present between the atoms which is typical for the layered system.

Longitudinal $\bar \Lambda_0$ polarization in heavy ion collisions as a probe for QGP formation,The 28 GeV Dimuon Excess in Lepton Specific 2HDM,True,"We present an analysis of the longitudinal $\bar \Lambda_0$ polarization in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The polarization of $\bar \Lambda_0$'s coming from the decay chain $\bar{\Xi}\to \bar{\Lambda}_0+\pi$ exhibits a very well differentiated behavior depending on the production region of the primordial $\bar \Xi$'s. This effect reflects the different values of the $N_{\bar \Xi}/N_{\bar \Lambda_0}$ ratio in the QGP region, where nucleon-nucleon interactions take place in a hot and dense environment, and the peripherical region, in which ordinary nucleon-nucleon interactions occur. An increase in the longitudinal $\bar \Lambda_0$ polarization signals a strangeness enhancement which is thought as a property of the QGP phase.","We explore the Higgs mass spectrum in a class of Two Higgs Doublet Models (THDMs) in which a scalar SU(2)_L doublet interacts only with quarks, while the second one interacts only with leptons. The spectrum includes two CP-even Higgs bosons, either of which can account for the SM-like Higgs boson, and the spectra involving light Higgs bosons receive strong impacts from the LEP results and the current collider analyses. We find that a consistent spectrum can involve a CP-odd Higgs boson as light as about 10 GeV, while the lightest CP-even Higgs boson cannot be lighter than about 55 GeV when m_A ~ 28 GeV. These analyses can rather bound the low tan beta region which can also accommodate an observed excess in dimuon events at m_mumu ~ 28 GeV. A lepton-specific class of THDMs (LS-THDM) can predict such an excess through A -> mu mu decays, while the solutions can be constrained by the A -> tau tau mode.

"The Two-Parameter Brane Sigma-Model: M*, M' solutions and M-theory solutions dependent on exotic coordinates",More on superstring chiral measures,True,"We investigate two-parameter solutions of sigma-models on two dimensional symmetric spaces contained in E11. Embedding such sigma-model solutions in space-time gives solutions of M* and M'-theory where the metric depends on general travelling wave functions, as opposed to harmonic functions typical in general relativity, supergravity and M-theory. Weyl reflection allows such solutions to be mapped to M-theory solutions where the wave functions depend explicitly on extra coordinates contained in the fundamental representation of E11.","In this paper we study the expressions of the superstring chiral measures for $g\leq 5$. We obtain certain new expressions which are functions of higher powers of theta constants. For $g=3$ we show that the measures can be written in terms of fourth power of theta constants and for $g=4$ in terms of squares of theta constants. In both cases the forms $\Xi_8^{(g)}[0^{(g)}]$ appearing in the expression of the measures are defined on the whole Siegel upper half space. Instead, for $g=5$ we find a form $\Xi_8^{(5)}[0^{(5)}]$ which is a polynomial in the classical theta constants, well defined on the Siegel upper half space and satisfying some suitable constraints on the moduli space of curves (and not on the whole Siegel upper half space) that could be a candidate for the genus five superstring measure. Moreover, we discuss the problem of the uniqueness of this form in genus five. We also determine the dimension of certain spaces of modular forms and reinterpret the vanishing of the cosmological constant in terms of group representations.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

The Noncommutative S-Matrix,The Muon g-2,True,"As a simple example of how recently developed on-shell techniques apply to nonlocal theories, we study the S-matrix of noncommutative gauge theories. In the complex plane, this S-matrix has essential singularities that signal the nonlocal behavior of the theory. In spite of this, we show that tree-level amplitudes may be obtained by BCFW type recursion relations. At one loop we find a complete basis of master integrals (this basis is larger than the corresponding basis in the ordinary theory). Any one-loop noncommutative amplitude may be written as a linear combination of these integrals with coefficients that we relate to products of tree amplitudes. We show that the noncommutative N=4 SYM theory has a structurally simple S-matrix, just like the ordinary N=4 SYM theory.","The muon anomalous magnetic moment is one of the most precisely measured quantities in particle physics. In a recent experiment at Brookhaven it has been measured with a remarkable 14-fold improvement of the previous CERN experiment reaching a precision of 0.54ppm. Since the first results were published, a persisting ""discrepancy"" between theory and experiment of about 3 standard deviations is observed. It is the largest ""established"" deviation from the Standard Model seen in a ""clean"" electroweak observable and thus could be a hint for New Physics to be around the corner. This deviation triggered numerous speculations about the possible origin of the ""missing piece"" and the increased experimental precision animated a multitude of new theoretical efforts which lead to a substantial improvement of the prediction of the muon anomaly a_mu=(g_mu-2)/2. The dominating uncertainty of the prediction, caused by strong interaction effects, could be reduced substantially, due to new hadronic cross section measurements in electron-positron annihilation at low energies. Also the recent electron g-2 measurement at Harvard contributes substantially to the progress in this field, as it allows for a much more precise determination of the fine structure constant alpha as well as a cross check of the status of our theoretical understanding.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Low-energy formulas for neutrino masses with $\tan \beta$-dependent hierarchy,Dark matter and observable Lepton Flavour Violation,True,"Using radiative correction and seesaw mechanism,we derive analytic formulas for neutrino masses in SUSY unified theories exhibiting, for the first time, a new hierarchial relation among them.The new hierarchy is found to be quite significant especially for smaller values of $\tan\beta$.","Seesaw models with leptonic symmetries allow right-handed (RH) neutrino masses at the electroweak scale, or even lower, at the same time having large Yukawa couplings with the Standard Model leptons, thus yielding observable effects at current or near-future lepton-flavour-violation (LFV) experiments. These models have been previously considered also in connection to low-scale leptogenesis, but the combination of observable LFV and successful leptogenesis has appeared to be difficult to achieve unless the leptonic symmetry is embedded into a larger one. In this paper, instead, we follow a different route and consider a possible connection between large LFV rates and Dark Matter (DM). We present a model in which the same leptonic symmetry responsible for the large Yukawa couplings guarantees the stability of the DM candidate, identified as the lightest of the RH neutrinos. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry, caused by a Majoron-like field, also provides a mechanism to produce the observed relic density via the decays of the latter. The phenomenological implications of the model are discussed, finding that large LFV rates, observable in the near-future $\mu \to e$ conversion experiments, require the DM mass to be in the keV range. Moreover, the active-neutrino coupling to the Majoron-like scalar field could be probed in future detections of supernova neutrino bursts.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

The CP violating phase $\gamma$ from global fit of rare charmless hadronic B decays,Faster Parton Distribution Evaluation in Monte Carlos,True,"We study constraints on the CP violating phase $\gamma$ in the Kobayashi-Maskawa model using available experimental data. We first follow the conventional method to up date the constraint on $\gamma$ by performing a $\chi^2$ analysis using data from $|\epsilon_K|$, $\Delta m_{B_{d,s}}$ and $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$. We also include the recent information on $\sin2\beta$ in the analysis. We obtain the best fit for $\gamma$ to be $66^\circ$ and the 95% C.L. allowed range to be $42^\circ \sim 87^\circ$. We then develop a method to carry out a $\chi^2$ analysis based on SU(3) symmetry using data from $B\to \pi \pi$ and $B\to K \pi$. We also discuss SU(3) breaking effects from model estimate. We find that present data on $B\to \pi\pi, K \pi$ can also give some constraint on $\gamma$ although weaker than the earlier method limited by the present experimental errors. Future improved data will provide more stringent constraint. Finally we perform a combined fit using data from $|\epsilon_K|$, $\Delta m_{B_{d,s}}$, $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$, $\sin2\beta$ and rare charmless hadronic B decays. The combined analysis gives $\gamma=67^\circ$ for the best fit value and $43^\circ \sim 87^\circ$ as the 95% C.L. allowed range. Several comments on other methods to determine $\gamma$ based on SU(3) symmetry are also provided.","I recommend a few trivial changes to the routines that evaluate CTEQ parton distribution functions.

Thickness dependence of unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance in metallic bilayers,Little-Parks oscillations near a persistent current loop,True,"A nonlinear magnetoresistance - called unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance - is recently experimentally discovered in metallic bilayers consisting of a heavy metal and a ferromagnetic metal. To study the fundamental mechanism of the USMR, both ferromagnetic and heavy metallic layer thickness dependence of the USMR are presented in a Pt/Co/AlOx trilayer at room temperature. To avoid ambiguities, second harmonic Hall measurements are used for separating spin-Hall and thermal contributions to the non-linear magnetoresistance. The experimental results are fitted by using a drift-diffusion theory, with parameters extracted from an analysis of longitudinal resistivity of the Co layer within the framework of the Fuchs-Sondheimer model. A good agreement with the theory is found, demonstrating that the USMR is governed by both the spin-Hall effect in the heavy metallic layer and the metallic diffusion process in the ferromagnetic layer.","We investigate the Little-Parks oscillations caused by a persistent current loop set on the top edge of a mesoscopic superconducting thin-walled cylinder with a finite height. For a short cylinder the Little-Parks oscillations are approximately the same ones as the standard effect, as there is only one magnetic flux piercing the cylinder. For a tall cylinder the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field makes different magnetic fluxes pierce the cylinder at distinct heights and we show here that this produces two distinct Little-Parks oscillatory regimes according to the persistent current loop. We show that these two regimes, and also the transition between them, are observable in current measurements done in the superconducting cylinder. The two regimes stem from different behavior along the height, as seen in the order parameter, numerically obtained from the Ginzburg-Landau theory through the finite element method",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Direct T-violation measurements and T-odd effects in decay experiments,How well do we need to measure the Higgs boson mass and self-coupling?,True,"Motivated by the recent experimental announcements for direct measurements of time-reversal non-invariance in the neutral kaon system, we make a comparative discussion of the CPLEAR and KTeV measurements. The most suitable way to consistently incorporate the mixing, the time evolution and the decays of kaons, is to describe the neutral kaon system as a system with a non-Hermitean Hamiltonian. In this framework, the physical (decaying) incoming and outgoing states are distinct and belong to dual spaces. Moreover, since they are eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian, they never oscillate. This is directly manifest in the orthogonality conditions of the physical states, which entirely determine the evolution of the kaon system. Along these lines we conclude: CPLEAR studies K0-bar{K0} oscillations, a process where initial and final states can be reversed, the CPLEAR asymmetry being an effect directly related to the definition of time-reversal. Conclusively, CPLEAR provides a direct measurement of T-violation without any assumption either on unitarity or on CPT-invariance. The KTeV experiment studies in particular the process KL -> pi+ pi- e+ e- where they measure a T-odd effect. However, using unitarity together with estimates of the final state interactions, it should be possible to determine whether this effect can be identified with a genuine T-reversal violation.","Much of the discussion regarding future measurements of the Higgs boson mass and self-coupling is focussed on how well various collider options can do. In this article we ask a physics-based question of how well do we need colliders to measure these quantities to have an impact on discovery of new physics or an impact in how we understand the role of the Higgs boson in nature. We address the question within the framework of the Standard Model and various beyond the Standard Model scenarios, including supersymmetry and theories of composite Higgs bosons. We conclude that the LHC's stated ability to measure the Higgs boson to better than 150 MeV will be as good as we will ever need to know the Higgs boson mass in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, we estimate that the self-coupling will likely need to be measured to better than 20 percent to see a deviation from the Standard Model expectation.

Soliton disentangling and ferroelectric hysteresis in reconstructed moire superlattices,Potential mechanical loss mechanisms in bulk materials for future gravitational wave detectors,True,"Moire materials, created by lattice-mismatch or/and twist-angle, have spurred great interest in excavating novel quantum phases of matter. Latterly, emergent interfacial ferroelectricity has been surprisingly found in spatial inversion symmetry broken systems, such as rhombohedral-stacked bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, the evolution of moire superlattices corresponding to polarization switching and hysteresis is still unclear, which is crucial for giving insight into the interplay between lattice symmetry and band topology, as well as developing optoelectronic memory devices. Here we report on the observation of phonon splitting at strain soliton networks in reconstructed moire superlattices, arising from the twisting and relaxing induced strong three-fold rotational symmetry (C3) breaking. The interval of phonon splitting is tunable by a perpendicular displacement field and exhibits ferroelectric-related hysteresis loops. These phonon evolution features are attributed to the contribution of moire solitons disentangling and lattice viscosity during the motion of domain walls. Moreover, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle moire ferroelectric tunneling junction, whose barrier is modified by net polarization with a tunneling electroresistance of ~10^4. Our work not only reveals the lattice dynamics of moire solitons but also presents a potential pathway for future ferroelectric-based optoelectronic memory devices.","Low mechanical loss materials are needed to further decrease thermal noise in upcoming gravitational wave detectors. We present an analysis of the contribution of Akhieser and thermoelastic damping on the experimental results of resonant mechanical loss measurements. The combination of both processes allows the fit of the experimental data of quartz in the low temperature region (10 K to 25 K). A fully anisotropic numerical calculation over a wide temperature range (10 K to 300 K) reveals, that thermoelastic damping is not a dominant noise source in bulk silicon samples.

Disentangling AGN and Star Formation in Soft X-rays,The temperature of hot gas halos of early-type galaxies,True,"We have explored the interplay of star formation and AGN activity in soft X-rays (0.5-2 keV) in two samples of Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy2s). Using a combination of low resolution CCD spectra from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we modeled the soft emission of 34 Sy2s using power law and thermal models. For the 11 sources with high signal-to-noise Chandra imaging of the diffuse host galaxy emission, we estimate the luminosity due to star formation by removing the AGN, fitting the residual emission. The AGN and star formation contributions to the soft X-ray luminosity (i.e. L$_{x,AGN}$ and L$_{x,SF}$) for the remaining 24 Sy2s were estimated from the power law and thermal luminosities derived from spectral fitting. These luminosities were scaled based on a template derived from XSINGS analysis of normal star forming galaxies. To account for errors in the luminosities derived from spectral fitting and the spread in the scaling factor, we estimated L$_{x,AGN}$ and L$_{x,SF}$ from Monte Carlo simulations. These simulated luminosities agree with L$_{x,AGN}$ and L$_{x,SF}$ derived from Chandra imaging analysis within a 3\sigma\ confidence level. Using the infrared [NeII]12.8\mu m and [OIV]26\mu m lines as a proxy of star formation and AGN activity, respectively, we independently disentangle the contributions of these two processes to the total soft X-ray emission. This decomposition generally agrees with L$_{x,SF}$ and L$_{x,AGN}$ at the 3\sigma\ level. In the absence of resolvable nuclear emission, our decomposition method provides a reasonable estimate of emission due to star formation in galaxies hosting type 2 AGN.","Recently, the temperature T and luminosity L_X of the hot gas halos of early type galaxies have been derived with unprecedented accuracy from Chandra data, for 30 galaxies covering a wider range of galactic luminosity (and central velocity dispersion sigma_c) than before. This work investigates the origin of the observed temperatures, by examining the relationship between them and the galaxy structure, the gas heating due to Type Ia supernovae (SNIa's) and the gravitational potential, and the dynamical status of the gas flow. In galaxies with sigma_c<200 km/s, the T's are close to a fiducial average temperature for the gas when in outflow; at 200<sigma_c (km/s)<250, the T's are generally lower than this, and unrelated with sigma_c, which requires a more complex gas flow status; at larger sigma_c, the T's may increase as sigma_c^2, as expected for infall heating, though heating from SNIa's, independent of sigma_c, should be dominant. All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to ~0.5 keV. This additional heating can be provided in the X-ray brightest galaxies by SNIa's and infall heating, with a SNIa's energy input even lower than in standard assumptions; in the X-ray fainter ones it can be provided by SNIa's, whose energy input would be required close to the full standard value at the largest sigma_c. This same energy input, though, would produce temperatures larger than observed at low sigma_c, if entirely thermalized. The values of the observed T's increase from outflows to inflows; the gas is relatively hotter in outflows, though, if the T's are rescaled by the virial temperature. For 200<sigma_c(km/s)<250, lower L_X values tend to correspond to lower T's, which deserves further investigation.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Incorporating the Stern-Gerlach delayed-choice quantum eraser into the undergraduate quantum mechanics curriculum,Instructional Strategies that Foster Effective Problem-Solving,True,"As ""Stern-Gerlach first"" becomes the new paradigm within the undergraduate quantum mechanics curriculum, we show how one can extend the treatment found in conventional textbooks to cover some of the exciting new developments within the quantum field. Namely, we illustrate how one can employ Dirac notation and conventional quantum rules to describe a delayed choice variant of the quantum eraser which is realized within the Stern-Gerlach framework. Covering this material, allows the instructor to reinforce notions of changes of basis functions, quantum superpositions, quantum measurement, and the complementarity principle as expressed in whether we know ""which-way"" information or not. It also allows the instructor to dispel common misconceptions of when a measurement occurs and when a system is in a superposition of states. We comment at the end how a similar methodology can be employed when the more conventional two-slit experiment is treated.","Helping students become proficient problem solvers is a major goal of many physics courses from introductory to advanced levels.

Nuclear parton distribution functions and their effects on sin^2 theta_W anomaly,Higgs Bosons in a minimal R-parity conserving left-right supersymmetric model,True,Nuclear parton distribution functions (NPDFs) are investigated by analyzing the data on structure functions F_2^A and Drell-Yan cross sections sigma_{DY}^{pA}.

DM+$b\bar b$ simulations with DMSimp: an update,New QCD Sum Rule for $D(0^+)$,True,"Searches for dark matter (DM) produced using collider data probe wide regions of the allowed parameter space of many models and have become competitive with more traditional searches. The interpretations of the results can be efficiently performed in simplified models, which feature only a mediator and a DM candidate together with the interactions among them and the standard model particles. The DMSimp model in FeynRules currently features a wide set of $s$-channel simplified models and can be exploited by the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework to produce event samples including NLO QCD corrections for realistic simulations. Higher-order corrections typically have a sizeable impact on the total production rate and lead to a reduction of the theoretical uncertainties. In this short note we report on a recent update of the DMSimp model, which makes it possible to simulate dark matter production in association with bottom quarks in a mixed four-flavour scheme, where the $\overline{\rm MS}$ renormalisation for the bottom-quark Yukawa is employed, while the bottom quark mass is on shell. By comparing with five-flavour scheme, we show that the mixed four-flavor scheme provides reliable predictions for DM+$b\bar b$ final states in a wide range of DM masses.","We derive a new QCD sum rule for $D(0^+)$ which has only the $D\pi$ continuum with a resonance in the hadron side, using the assumption similar to that has been successfully used in our previous work to the mass of $D_s(0^+)(2317)$. For the value of the pole mass $M_c=1.38 $ GeV as used in the $D_s(0^+)$ case we find that the mass of $D(0^+)$ derived from this sum rule is significantly lower than that derived from the sum rule with the pole approximation.

A Unified Theory of Consequences of Spontaneous Emission in a $\Lambda$ System,Symmetry-based requirement for the measurement of electrical and thermal Hall conductivity under an in-plane magnetic field,True,"In a $\Lambda$ system with two nearly degenerate ground states and one excited state in an atom or quantum dot, spontaneous radiative decay can lead to a range of phenomena, including electron-photon entanglement, spontaneously generated coherence, and two-pathway decay. We show that a treatment of the radiative decay as a quantum evolution of a single physical system composed of a three-level electron subsystem and photons leads to a range of consequences depending on the electron-photon interaction and the measurement. Different treatments of the emitted photon channel the electron-photon system into a variety of final states. The theory is not restricted to the three-level system.","The in-plane (thermal) Hall effect is an unconventional transverse response when the applied magnetic field is in the (heat) current plane. In contrast to the normal Hall effect, the in-plane Hall effect requires the absence of certain crystal symmetries, and possibly manifests a non-trivial topology of quantum materials. An accurate estimation of the intrinsic in-plane (thermal) Hall conductivity is crucial to identify the underlying mechanisms as in the case of the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate alpha-RuCl3. Here, we give the symmetry conditions for the in-plane Hall effect and discuss the implications that may impede the experimental evaluation of the in-plane (thermal) Hall conductivity within the single-device measurement. First, the lack of symmetry in crystals can create merohedral twin domains that cancel the total Hall signal. Second, even in a twin-free crystal, the intrinsic response is potentially contaminated by the out-of-plane conduction in three-dimensional systems, which is systematically unavoidable in the in-plane Hall systems. Third, even in a quasi-two-dimensional system, the conversion of (thermal) resistivity, rho (lambda), to (thermal) conductivity, sigma (kappa) requires protocols beyond the widely-used simplified formula due to the lack of in-plane-rotational symmetry. In principle, two independent sample devices are necessary to accurately estimate the s_xy (k_xy). As a case study, we discuss the half-integer quantization of the in-plane thermal Hall effect in the spin-disordered state of alpha-RuCl3. For an accurate measurement of the thermal Hall effect, it is necessary to avoid crystals with the merohedral twins contributing oppositely to k_xy, while the out-of-plane transport may have a negligible effect.

Thermodynamic Behavior of Friedmann Equation at Apparent Horizon of FRW Universe,Renormalization group irreversible functions in more than two dimensions,True,"It is shown that the differential form of Friedmann equation of a FRW universe can be rewritten as a universal form $dE = TdS + WdV$ at apparent horizon, where $E$ and $V$ are the matter energy and volume inside the apparent horizon (the energy $E$ is the same as the Misner-Sharp energy in the case of Einstein general relativity), $W=(\rho-P)/2$ is the work density and $\rho$ and $P$ are energy density and pressure of the matter in the universe, respectively. From the thermodynamic identity one can derive that the apparent horizon has associated entropy $S= A/4G$ and temperature $T = \kappa / 2\pi$ in Einstein general relativity, where $A$ is the area of apparent horizon and $\kappa$ is the surface gravity at apparent horizon. We extend our procedure to the Gauss-Bonnet gravity and more general Lovelock gravity and show that the differential form of Friedmann equations in these gravities can also be rewritten to thee universal form $dE = TdS + WdV$ at the apparent horizon with entropy $S$ being given by expression previously known via black hole thermodynamics.","There are two general irreversibility theorems for the renormalization group in more than two dimensions: the first one is of entropic nature, while the second one, by Forte and Latorre, relies on the properties of the stress-tensor trace, and has been recently questioned by Osborn and Shore. We start by establishing under what assumptions this second theorem can still be valid. Then it is compared with the entropic theorem and shown to be essentially equivalent. However, since the irreversible function of the (corrected) Forte-Latorre theorem is non universal (whereas the relative entropy of the other theorem is universal), it needs the additional step of renormalization. On the other hand, the irreversibility theorem is only guaranteed to be unambiguous if the integral of the stress-tensor trace correlator is finite, which happens for free theories only in dimension smaller than four.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Symmetry breaking in commensurate graphene rotational stacking; a comparison of theory and experiment,Electronic structure of few-layer black phosphorus from $\mu$-ARPES,True,"Graphene stacked in a Bernal configuration (60 degrees relative rotations between sheets) differs electronically from isolated graphene due to the broken symmetry introduced by interlayer bonds forming between only one of the two graphene unit cell atoms. A variety of experiments have shown that non-Bernal rotations restore this broken symmetry; consequently, these stacking varieties have been the subject of intensive theoretical interest. Most theories predict substantial changes in the band structure ranging from the development of a Van Hove singularity and an angle dependent electron localization that causes the Fermi velocity to go to zero as the relative rotation angle between sheets goes to zero. In this work we show by direct measurement that non-Bernal rotations preserve the graphene symmetry with only a small perturbation due to weak effective interlayer coupling. We detect neither a Van Hove singularity nor any significant change in the Fermi velocity. These results suggest significant problems in our current theoretical understanding of the origins of the band structure of this material.","Black phosphorus (BP) stands out among two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors because of its high mobility and thickness dependent direct band gap. However, the quasiparticle band structure of ultrathin BP has remained inaccessible to experiment thus far. Here we use a recently developed laser-based micro-focus angle resolved photoemission ($\mu$-ARPES) system to establish the electronic structure of 2-9 layer BP from experiment. Our measurements unveil ladders of anisotropic, quantized subbands at energies that deviate from the scaling observed in conventional semiconductor quantum wells.

Superconductivity and single crystal growth of Ni0:05TaS2,Crystal Structure of the Sodium Cobaltate Deuterate Superconductor NaxCoO2o4xD2O (x=1/3),True,"Superconductivity was discovered in a Ni0:05TaS2 single crystal. A Ni0:05TaS2 single crystal was successfully grown via the NaCl/KCl flux method. The obtained lattice constant c of Ni0:05TaS2 is 1.1999 nm, which is significantly smaller than that of 2H-TaS2 (1.208 nm). Electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements reveal that the superconductivity transition temperature of Ni0:05TaS2 is enhanced from 0.8 K (2H-TaS2) to 3.9 K. The charge-density-wave transition of the matrix compound 2H-TaS2 is suppressed in Ni0:05TaS2. The success of Ni0:05TaS2 single crystal growth via a NaCl/KCl flux demonstrates that NaCl/KCl flux method will be a feasible method for single crystal growth of the layered transition metal dichalcogenides.","Neutron and x-ray powder diffraction have been used to investigate the crystal structures of a sample of the newly-discovered superconducting sodium cobaltate deuterate compound with composition Na0.31(3)CoO2o1.25(2)D2O and its anhydrous parent compound Na0.61(1)CoO2. The deuterate superconducting compound is formed by coordinating four D2O molecules (two above and two below) to each Na ion in a way that gives Na-O distances nearly equal to those in the parent compound. One deuteron of the D2O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO2 plane and the oxygen atom and the second deuteron of each D2O molecule lie approximately in a plane between the Na layer and the CoO2 layers. This coordination of Na by four D2O molecules leads to ordering of the Na ions and D2O molecules. The sample studied here, which has Tc=4.5 K, has a refined composition of Na0.31(3)CoO2o1.25(2)D2O, in agreement with the expected 1:4 ratio of Na to D2O. These results show that the optimal superconducting composition should be viewed as a specific hydrated compound, not a solid solution of Na and D2O (H2O) in NaxCoO2oyD2O. Studies of physical properties vs. Na or D2O composition should be viewed with caution until it is verified that the compound remains in the same phase over the composition range of the study.",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) VI: Kinematic Structures around the Very Low Mass Protostar IRAS 16253-2429,The MOSDEF Survey: the Variation of the Dust Attenuation Curve with Metallicity,True,"Precise estimates of protostellar masses are crucial to characterize the formation of stars of low masses down to brown-dwarfs (BDs; M* < 0.08 Msun). The most accurate estimation of protostellar mass uses the Keplerian rotation in the circumstellar disk around the protostar. To apply the Keplerian rotation method to a protostar at the low-mass end, we have observed the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the 1.3 mm continuum at an angular resolution of 0.07"" (10 au), and in the 12CO, C18O, 13CO (J=2-1), and SO (J_N = 6_5-5_4) molecular lines, as part of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). The continuum emission traces a non-axisymmetric, disk-like structure perpendicular to the associated 12CO outflow. The position-velocity (PV) diagrams in the C18O and 13CO lines can be interpreted as infalling and rotating motions. In contrast, the PV diagram along the major axis of the disk-like structure in the 12CO line allows us to identify Keplerian rotation. The central stellar mass and the disk radius are estimated to be ~0.12-0.17 Msun and ~13-19 au, respectively. The SO line suggests the existence of an accretion shock at a ring (r~28 au) surrounding the disk and a streamer from the eastern side of the envelope. IRAS 16253-2429 is not a proto-BD but has a central stellar mass close to the BD mass regime, and our results provide a typical picture of such very low-mass protostars.","We derive the UV-optical stellar dust attenuation curve of galaxies at z=1.4-2.6 as a function of gas-phase metallicity. We use a sample of 218 star-forming galaxies, excluding those with very young or heavily obscured star formation, from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey with H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and [NII]$\lambda 6585$ spectroscopic measurements. We constrain the shape of the attenuation curve by comparing the average flux densities of galaxies sorted into bins of dust obscuration using Balmer decrements, i.e., H$\alpha$-to-H$\beta$ luminosities. The average attenuation curve for the high-metallicity sample (12+log(O/H)>8.5, corresponding to $M_*\gtrsim10^{10.4}\,M_{\odot}$) has a shallow slope, identical to that of the Calzetti local starburst curve, and a significant UV 2175A extinction bump that is $\sim 0.5\times$ the strength of the Milky Way bump. On the other hand, the average attenuation curve of the low-metallicity sample (12+log(O/H) $\sim 8.2-8.5$) has a steeper slope similar to that of the SMC curve, only consistent with the Calzetti slope at the $3\sigma$ level. The UV bump is not detected in the low-metallicity curve, indicating the relative lack of the small dust grains causing the bump at low metallicities. Furthermore, we find that on average the nebular reddening (E(B-V)) is a factor of 2 times larger than that of the stellar continuum for galaxies with low metallicities, while the nebular and stellar reddening are similar for galaxies with higher metallicities. The latter is likely due to a high surface density of dusty clouds embedding the star forming regions but also reddening the continuum in the high-metallicity galaxies.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Scheme Dependence in Polarized Deep Inelastic Scattering,Symmetries of hadrons after unbreaking the chiral symmetry,True,We study the effect of scheme dependence upon the NLO QCD analysis of the world data on polarized DIS. The reliability of an analysis at NLO is demonstrated by the consistency of our polarized densities with the NLO transformation rules relating them to each other. We stress the importance of the chiral JET scheme in which all the hard effects are consistently absorbed in the Wilson coefficient functions.,"We study hadron correlators upon artificial restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. In a dynamical lattice simulation we remove the lowest lying eigenmodes of the Dirac operator from the valence quark propagators and study evolution of the hadron masses obtained. All mesons and baryons in our study, except for a pion, survive unbreaking the chiral symmetry and their exponential decay signals become essentially better. From the analysis of the observed spectroscopic patterns we conclude that confinement still persists while the chiral symmetry is restored. All hadrons fall into different chiral multiplets. The broken U(1)_A symmetry does not get restored upon unbreaking the chiral symmetry. We also observe signals of some higher symmetry that includes chiral symmetry as a subgroup. Finally, from comparison of the \Delta - N splitting before and after unbreaking of the chiral symmetry we conclude that both the color-magnetic and the flavor-spin quark-quark interactions are of equal importance.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Some remarks on a paper by G.-S. Yang and H.-C.Kim: Mass splitting of SU(3) baryons within a chiral soliton model,Probing Proton Structure at the Large Hadron electron Collider,True,"In a recent paper Yang and Kim discuss the lowest baryon mass formulas using a chiral soliton model. However, contrary to their assertion, their result is not equivalent to a generalized Gell Mann-Okubo mass formula derived (G.Morpurgo 1992) using only general properties of QCD (The General parameterization method). The reason for the non equivalence is that the generalized mass formula include all the main terms that break flavor at second order, whereas the Authors above do not go beyond first order flavor breaking (and should therefore find the usual Gell Mann Okubo formula). That is is not so, due to some inconsistencies. Below we confine to the part of the Yang-Kim paper dealing with the mass formula. We will not consider the other items of their paper.","For the foreseeable future, the exploration of the high-energy frontier will be the domain of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Of particular significance will be its high-luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC), which will operate until the mid-2030s. In this endeavour, for the full exploitation of the HL-LHC physics potential an improved understanding of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton is critical. The HL-LHC program would be uniquely complemented by the proposed Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC), a high-energy lepton-proton and lepton-nucleus collider based at CERN. In this work, we build on our recent PDF projections for the HL-LHC to assess the constraining power of the LHeC measurements of inclusive and heavy quark structure functions. We find that the impact of the LHeC would be significant, reducing PDF uncertainties by up to an order of magnitude in comparison to state-of-the-art global fits. In comparison to the HL-LHC projections, the PDF constraints from the LHeC are in general more significant for small and intermediate values of the momentum fraction x. At higher values of x, the impact of the LHeC and HL-LHC data is expected to be of a comparable size, with the HL-LHC constraints being more competitive in some cases, and the LHeC ones in others. Our results illustrate the encouraging complementarity of the HL-LHC and the LHeC in terms of charting the quark and gluon structure of the proton.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

The Rate and Spatial Distribution of Novae in M31 as Determined by a Twenty-Year Survey,Rotating and infalling motion around the high-mass young stellar object Cepheus A-HW2 observed with the methanol maser at 6.7 GHz,True,"A long-term (1995-2016) survey for novae in the nearby Andromeda galaxy (M31) was conducted as part of the Research-Based Science Education initiative. During the course of the survey 180 nights of observation were completed at Kitt Peak, Arizona. A total of 262 novae were either discovered or confirmed, 40 of which have not been previously reported. Of these, 203 novae form a spatially-complete sample detected by the KPNO/WIYN 0.9-m telescope within a $20'\times20'$ field centered on the nucleus of M31. An additional 50 novae are part of a spatially-complete sample detected by the KPNO 4-m telescope within a larger $36'\times36'$ field. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the spatial distribution of novae in both surveys follows the bulge light of M31 somewhat more closely than the overall background light of the galaxy. After correcting for the limiting magnitude and the spatial and temporal coverage of the surveys, a final nova rate in M31 is found to be $R=40^{+5}_{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is considerably lower than recent estimates. When normalized to the $K$-band luminosity of M31, this value yields a luminosity-specific nova rate, $\nu_K = 3.3\pm0.4$ yr$^{-1} [10^{10} L_{\odot,K}]^{-1}$. By scaling the M31 nova rate using the relative infrared luminosities of M31 and our Galaxy, a nova rate of $R_\mathrm{G}=28^{+5}_{-4}$ is found for the Milky Way.","We have measured the internal proper motions of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers associated with Cepheus A (Cep A) HW2 using Very Long Baseline Interferometery (VLBI) observations. We conducted three epochs of VLBI monitoring observations of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers in Cep A-HW2 with the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN) over the period between 2006-2008. In 2006, we were able to use phase-referencing to measure the absolute coordinates of the maser emission with an accuracy of a few milliarcseconds. We compared the maser distribution with other molecular line observations that trace the rotating disk. We measured the internal proper motions for 29 methanol maser spots, of which 19 were identified at all three epochs and the remaining ten at only two epochs. The magnitude of proper motions ranged from 0.2 to 7.4 km/s, with an average of 3.1 km/s. Although there are large uncertainties in the observed internal proper motions of the methanol maser spots in Cep A, they are well fitted by a disk that includes both rotation and infall velocity components. The derived rotation and infall velocities at the disk radius of 680 au are 0.5 +- 0.7 and 1.8 +- 0.7 km/s, respectively. Assuming that the modeled disk motion accurately represents the accretion disk around the Cep A-HW2 high-mass YSO, we estimated the mass infall rate to be 3 x 10^{-4} n_8 Msun/yr (n_8 is the gas volume density in units of 10^{8} cm^{-3}). The combination of the estimated mass infall rate and the magnitude of the fitted infall velocity suggests that Cep A-HW2 is at an evolutionary phase of active gas accretion from the disk onto the central high-mass YSO. The infall momentum rate is estimated to be 5 x 10^{-4} n_8 Msun/yr km/s, which is larger than the estimated stellar radiation pressure of the HW2 object, supporting the hypothesis that this object is in an active gas accretion phase.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Electronic Transport Properties of Carbon NanoBuds,Understanding Variations in Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence in Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides,True,"Fullerene functionalized carbon nanotubes -- NanoBuds -- form a novel class of hybrid carbon materials, which possesses many advantageous properties as compared to the pristine components. Here, we report a theoretical study of the electronic transport properties of these compounds. We use both ab initio techniques and tight-binding calculations to illustrate these materials' transmission properties, and give physical arguments to interpret the numerical results. Specifically, above the Fermi energy we find a strong reduction of electron transmission due to localized states in certain regions of the structure while below the Fermi energy all considered structures exhibit a high-transmission energy band with a geometry dependent width.","Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides are promising materials for valleytronic operations. They exhibit two inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin zone, and the valley populations can be directly controlled and determined using circularly polarized optical excitation and emission. The photoluminescence polarization reflects the ratio of the two valley populations. A wide range of values for the degree of circularly polarized emission, Pcirc, has been reported for monolayer WS2, although the reasons for the disparity are unclear. Here we optically populate one valley, and measure Pcirc to explore the valley population dynamics at room temperature in a large number of monolayer WS2 samples synthesized via chemical vapor deposition. Under resonant excitation, Pcirc ranges from 2% to 32%, and we observe a pronounced inverse relationship between photoluminescence (PL) intensity and Pcirc. High quality samples exhibiting strong PL and long exciton relaxation time exhibit a low degree of valley polarization, and vice versa. This behavior is also demonstrated in monolayer WSe2 samples and transferred WS2, indicating that this correlation may be more generally observed and account for the wide variations reported for Pcirc. Time resolved PL provides insight into the role of radiative and non-radiative contributions to the observed polarization. Short non-radiative lifetimes result in a higher measured polarization by limiting opportunity for depolarizing scattering events.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Black holes in quartic-order beyond-generalized Proca theories,Theoretical priors in scalar-tensor cosmologies: Thawing quintessence,True,"The generalized Proca theories with second-order equations of motion can be healthily extended to a more general framework in which the number of propagating degrees of freedom remains unchanged. In the presence of a quartic-order nonminimal coupling to gravity arising in beyond-generalized Proca theories, the speed of gravitational waves $c_t$ on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological background can be equal to that of light $c$ under a certain condition. By using this condition alone, we show that the speed of gravitational waves in the vicinity of static and spherically symmetric black holes is also equivalent to $c$ for the propagation of odd-parity perturbations along both radial and angular directions. As a by-product, the black holes arising in our beyond-generalized Proca theories are plagued by neither ghost nor Laplacian instabilities against odd-parity perturbations. We show the existence of both exact and numerical black hole solutions endowed with vector hairs induced by the quartic-order coupling.","The late time acceleration of the Universe can be characterized in terms of an extra, time dependent, component of the universe -- dark energy. The simplest proposal for dark energy is a scalar-tensor theory -- quintessence -- which consists of a scalar field, $\phi$, whose dynamics is solely dictated by its potential, $V(\phi)$. Such a theory can be uniquely characterized by the equation of state of the scalar field energy momentum-tensor. We find the time dependence of the equation of state for a broad family of potentials and, using this information, we propose an analytic prior distribution for the most commonly used parametrization. We show that this analytic prior can be used to accurately predict the distribution of observables for the next generation of cosmological surveys.

"Second-order, number-conserving description of non-equilibrium dynamics in finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensates",Reduced density matrix approach to ultracold few-fermion systems in one dimension,True,"While the Gross--Pitaevskii equation is well-established as the canonical dynamical description of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at zero-temperature, describing the dynamics of BECs at finite temperatures remains a difficult theoretical problem, particularly when considering low-temperature, non-equilibrium systems in which depletion of the condensate occurs dynamically as a result of external driving. In this paper, we describe a fully time-dependent numerical implementation of a second-order, number-conserving description of finite-temperature BEC dynamics. This description consists of equations of motion describing the coupled dynamics of the condensate and non-condensate fractions in a self-consistent manner, and is ideally suited for the study of low-temperature, non-equilibrium, driven systems. The \delta-kicked-rotor BEC provides a prototypical example of such a system, and we demonstrate the efficacy of our numerical implementation by investigating its dynamics at finite temperature. We demonstrate that the qualitative features of the system dynamics at zero temperature are generally preserved at finite temperatures, and predict a quantitative finite-temperature shift of resonance frequencies which would be relevant for, and could be verified by, future experiments.","The variational determination of the two-fermion reduced density matrix is described for harmonically trapped, ultracold few-fermion systems in one dimension with equal spin populations. This is accomplished by formulating the problem as a semi-definite program, with the two-fermion reduced density matrix being subject to well-known $N$-representability conditions. The ground-state energies, as well as the density, pair-correlation function, and lower-order eigenvalues of the two-fermion reduced density matrix of various fermionic systems are found by utilising an augmented Lagrangian method for semi-definite programming. The ground-state energies are found to match well to those determined by full-configuration interaction and coupled-cluster calculations and the density, pair-correlation function, and eigenvalue results demonstrate that the salient features of these systems are well-described by this method. These results collectively demonstrate the utility of the reduced density matrix method firstly in describing strong correlation arising from short-range interactions, suggesting that the well-known N-representability conditions are sufficient to model ultracold fermionic systems, and secondly in illustrating the prospect of treating larger systems currently out of the reach of established methods.",Quantum Gases,"Quantum gases in condensed matter physics focuses on ultracold atomic and molecular gases, Bose-Einstein condensation, Feshbach resonances, spinor condensates, optical lattices, quantum simulation with cold atoms and molecules, and macroscopic interference phenomena."
The various accretion modes of AM Herculis: Clues from multi-wavelength observations in high accretion states,IceCube Search for High-Energy Neutrino Emission from TeV Pulsar Wind Nebulae,True,"We report on XMM-Newton and NuSTAR X-ray observations of the prototypical polar, AM Herculis, supported by ground-based photometry and spectroscopy, all obtained in high accretion states. In 2005, AM Herculis was in its regular mode of accretion, showing a self-eclipse of the main accreting pole. X-ray emission during the self-eclipse was assigned to a second pole through its soft X-ray emission and not to scattering. In 2015, AM Herculis was in its reversed mode with strong soft blobby accretion at the far accretion region. The blobby acretion region was more luminous than the other, persistently accreting, therefore called main region. Hard X-rays from the main region did not show a self-eclipse indicating a pronounced migration of the accretion footpoint. Extended phases of soft X-ray extinction through absorption in interbinary matter were observed for the first time in AM Herculis. The spectral parameters of a large number of individual soft flares could be derived. Simultaneous NuSTAR observations in the reversed mode of accretion revealed clear evidence for Compton reflection of radiation from the main pole at the white dwarf surface. This picture is supported by the trace of the Fe resonance line at 6.4 keV through the whole orbit. Highly ionized oxygen lines observed with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) were tentatively located at the bottom of the accretion column, although the implied densities are quite different from expectations. In the regular mode of accretion, the phase-dependent modulations in the ultraviolet (UV) are explained with projection effects of an accretion-heated spot at the prime pole. In the reversed mode projection effects cannot be recognized. The light curves reveal an extra source of UV radiation and extended UV absorbing dips. An Ha Doppler map obtained contemporaneously (abstract abridged)","Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are the main gamma-ray emitters in the Galactic plane. They are diffuse nebulae that emit nonthermal radiation. Pulsar winds, relativistic magnetized outflows from the central star, shocked in the ambient medium produce a multiwavelength emission from the radio through gamma rays. Although the leptonic scenario is able to explain most PWNe emission, a hadronic contribution cannot be excluded. A possible hadronic contribution to the high-energy gamma-ray emission inevitably leads to the production of neutrinos. Using 9.5 yr of all-sky IceCube data, we report results from a stacking analysis to search for neutrino emission from 35 PWNe that are high-energy gamma-ray emitters.

Terahertz Quantum Hall Effect in a Topological Insulator,Coulomb Frustrated Phase Separation in Quasi-Two-Dimensional Organic Conductors on the Verge of Charge Ordering,True,"Using THz spectroscopy in external magnetic fields we investigate the low-temperature charge dynamics of strained HgTe, a three dimensional topological insulator. From the Faraday rotation angle and ellipticity a complete characterization of the charge carriers is obtained, including the 2D density, the scattering rate and the Fermi velocity. The obtained value of the Fermi velocity provides further evidence for the Dirac character of the carriers in the sample. In resonator experiments, we observe quantum Hall oscillations at THz frequencies. The 2D density estimated from the period of these oscillations agrees well with direct transport experiments on the topological surface state. Our findings open new avenues for the studies of the finite-frequency quantum Hall effect in topological insulators.","On the basis of an analysis of a 3/4-filled two-dimensional (2D) extended Hubbard model under the fluctuation-exchange approximation, we find Coulomb frustrated phase separation (PS) in a region of nonzero temperature, where the quantum critical phenomenon of charge ordering (CO) dominates.

Hadronic resonance production and interaction in p-Pb collisions at LHC energies in EPOS3,Candidates for the 5$\alpha$ condensed state in ${}^{20}$Ne,True,"Using the EPOS3 model with UrQMD to describe the hadronic phase, we study the production of short-lived hadronic resonances and the modification of their yields and $p_{T}$ spectra in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. High-multiplicity p-Pb collisions exhibit similar behavior to mid-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies, and we find indications of a short-lived hadronic phase in p-Pb collisions that can modify resonance yields and $p_{T}$ spectra through scattering processes. The evolution of resonance production is investigated as a function of the system size, which is related to the lifetime of the hadronic phase, in order to study the onset of collective effects in p-Pb collisions. We also study hadron production separately in the core and corona parts of these collisions, and explore how this division affects the total particle yields as the system size increases.","We conducted the coincidence measurement of $\alpha$ particles inelastically scattered from ${}^{20}$Ne at $0^{\circ}$ and decay charged particles in order to search for the alpha-particle condensed state.

Tuning correlation effects with electron-phonon interactions,Extent of frustration in the classical Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model via bond anisotropy,True,"We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double kondo peak arrangement","In the pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ honeycomb Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling, there are two types of bond-dependent exchange interactions, named Kitaev ($K$) and $\Gamma$, leading to strong frustration. While the ground state of the Kitaev model is a quantum spin liquid with fractionalized excitations, the ground state of the $\Gamma$ model remains controversial. In particular, the phase diagram of the $K\Gamma$ model with ferromagnetic $K$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma$ interactions has been intensively studied because of its relevance to candidate materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. Numerical studies also included the effects of tuning the bond strengths, i.e., $z$-bond strength different from the other bonds. However, no clear consensus on the overall phase diagram has been reached yet. Here we study the classical $K\Gamma$ model with the anisotropic bond strength using Monte Carlo simulations to understand the emerging phases out of competition between the two frustrated limits. We also address how the anisotropic bond strength affects the phase diagram and strength of quantum fluctuations. We found various large unit cell phases due to the competing frustrations, and analyzed their intrinsic degeneracy based on the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Using the linear spin wave theory we showed that the anisotropic bond strength enhances quantum fluctuations in the $\Gamma$-dominant regime where a small reduced moment is observed. The implications of our findings in relation to the quantum model are also discussed.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Unified trade-off optimization of a three-level quantum refrigerator,Entanglement Properties of a Higher-Integer-Spin AKLT Model with Quantum Group Symmetry,True,"We study the optimal performance of a three-level quantum refrigerator using a trade-off objective function, $\Omega$ function, which represents a compromise between the energy benefits and the energy losses of a thermal device. First, we optimize the performance of our refrigerator by employing a two-parameter optimization scheme and show that the first two-terms in the series expansion of the obtained coefficient of performance (COP) match with those of some classical models of refrigerator. Then, in the high-temperature limit, optimizing with respect to one parameter while constraining the other one, we obtain the lower and upper bounds on the COP for both strong as well as weak (intermediate) matter-field coupling conditions. In the strong matter-field coupling regime, the obtained bounds on the COP exactly match with the bounds already known for some models of classical refrigerators. Further for weak matter-field coupling, we derive some new bounds on the the COP of the refrigerator which lie beyond the range covered by bounds obtained for strong matter-field coupling. Finally, in the parameter regime where both cooling power and $\Omega$ function can be maximized, we compare the cooling power of the quantum refrigerator at maximum $\Omega$ function with the maximum cooling power.","We study the entanglement properties of a higher-integer-spin Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model with quantum group symmetry in the periodic boundary condition. We exactly calculate the finite size correction terms of the entanglement entropies from the double scaling limit. We also evaluate the geometric entanglement, which serves as another measure for entanglement. We find the geometric entanglement reaches its maximum at the isotropic point, and decreases with the increase of the anisotropy. This behavior is similar to that of the entanglement entropies.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Quantum Feedback Cooling of a Mechanical Oscillator Using Variational Measurements:Tweaking Heisenberg's Microscope,Tunable sign change of spin Hall magnetoresistance in Pt/NiO/YIG structures,True,"We revisit the problem of preparing a mechanical oscillator in the vicinity of its quantum-mechanical ground state by means of feedback cooling based on continuous optical detection of the oscillator position. In the parameter regime relevant to ground state cooling, the optical back-action and imprecision noise set the bottleneck of achievable cooling and must be carefully balanced. This can be achieved by adapting the phase of the local oscillator in the homodyne detection realizing a so-called variational measurement. The trade-off between accurate position measurement and minimal disturbance can be understood in terms of Heisenberg's microscope and becomes particularly relevant when the measurement and feedback processes happen to be fast within the quantum coherence time of the system to be cooled. This corresponds to the regime of large quantum cooperativity $C_{\text{q}}\gtrsim1$, which was achieved in recent experiments on feedback cooling. Our method provides a simple path to further pushing the limits of current state-of-the-art experiments in quantum optomechanics.","Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) has been investigated in Pt/NiO/YIG structures in a wide range of temperature and NiO thickness. The SMR shows a negative sign below a temperature which increases with the NiO thickness. This is contrary to a conventional SMR theory picture applied to Pt/YIG bilayer which always predicts a positive SMR. The negative SMR is found to persist even when NiO blocks the spin transmission between Pt and YIG, indicating it is governed by the spin current response of NiO layer. We explain the negative SMR by the NiO 'spin-flop' coupled with YIG, which can be overridden at higher temperatures by positive SMR contribution from YIG. This highlights the role of magnetic structure in antiferromagnets for transport of pure spin current in multilayers.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Two-Moment Neutrino Flavor Transformation with applications to the Fast Flavor Instability in Neutron Star Mergers,Follow-up of X-ray transients detected by SWIFT with COLORES using the BOOTES network,True,"Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (MMA) has produced a wealth of data with much more to come in the future. This enormous data set will reveal new insights into the physics of Core Collapse SuperNovae (CCSN), Binary Neutron Star Mergers (BNSM), and many other objects where it is actually possible, if not probable, that new physics is in operation. To tease out different possibilities, we will need to analyze signals from photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves, and chemical elements. This task is made all the more difficult when it is necessary to evolve the neutrino component of the radiation field and associated quantum-mechanical property of flavor in order to model the astrophysical system of interest -- a numerical challenge that has not been addressed to this day. In this work, we take a step in this direction by adopting the technique of angular-integrated moments with a truncated tower of dynamical equations and a closure, convolving a flavor-transformation with spatial transport to evolve the neutrino radiation quantum field. We show that moments capture the dynamical features of Fast Flavor Instabilities (FFI) and provide comparable results to a more precise particle-in-cell method. We propose areas for improvement in the future.","The Burst Observer and Optical Transient Exploring System (BOOTES) is a network of telescopes that allows the continuous monitoring of transient astrophysical sources.

Next-to-Leading Order QCD Corrections to Inclusive Heavy-Flavor Production in Polarized Deep-Inelastic Scattering,Spin Physics with Top Quarks at Hadron Colliders,True,"We provide a first calculation of the complete next-to-leading order QCD corrections for heavy flavor contributions to the inclusive structure function $g_1$ in longitudinally polarized deep-inelastic scattering. The results are derived with largely analytical methods and retain the full dependence on the heavy quark's mass. We discuss all relevant technical details of the calculation and present numerical results for the heavy quark scaling functions. We perform important crosschecks to verify our results in the known limit of photoproduction and for the unpolarized electroproduction of heavy quarks. We also compare our calculations to the available, partial results in the polarized case, in particular, in the limit of asymptotically large photon virtualities, and analyze the behavior of the scaling functions near threshold. First steps towards phenomenological applications are taken by providing some estimates for inclusive charm production in polarized deep-inelastic scattering at a future electron-ion collider and studying their sensitivity to the polarized gluon distribution.

Higher-order topological insulators and superconductors protected by inversion symmetry,Coherent control via weak measurements in $^{31}$P single-atom electron and nuclear spin qubits,True,"We study surface states of topological crystalline insulators and superconductors protected by inversion symmetry. These fall into the category of ""higher-order"" topological insulators and superconductors which possess surface states that propagate along one-dimensional curves (hinges) or are localized at some points (corners) on the surface. We show that the surface states of higher-order topological insulators and superconductors can be thought of as globally irremovable topological defects and provide a complete classification of these inversion-protected phases in any spatial dimension for the ten symmetry classes by means of a layer construction. Furthermore, we discuss possible physical realizations of such states starting with a time-reversal invariant topological insulator (class AII) in three dimensions or a time-reversal invariant topological superconductor (class DIII) in two or three dimensions. The former can be used to build a three-dimensional second-order topological insulator which exhibits one-dimensional chiral or helical modes propagating along opposite edges, whereas the latter enables the construction of three-dimensional third-order or two-dimensional second-order topological superconductors hosting Majorana zero modes localized to two opposite corners. Being protected by inversion, such states are not pinned to a specific pair of edges or corners thus offering the possibility of controlling their location by applying inversion-symmetric perturbations such as magnetic field.","The understanding of weak measurements and interaction-free measurements has greatly expanded the conceptual and experimental toolbox to explore the quantum world. Here we demonstrate single-shot variable-strength weak measurements of the electron and the nuclear spin states of a single $^{31}$P donor in silicon. We first show how the partial collapse of the nuclear spin due to measurement can be used to coherently rotate the spin to a desired pure state. We explicitly demonstrate that phase coherence is preserved throughout multiple sequential single-shot weak measurements, and that the partial state collapse can be reversed. Second, we use the relation between measurement strength and perturbation of the nuclear state as a physical meter to extract the tunneling rates between the $^{31}$P donor and a nearby electron reservoir from data, conditioned on observing no tunneling events.

Assessing the detectability of the secondary spin in extreme mass-ratio inspirals with fully-relativistic numerical waveforms,Gamma-ray Polarimetry of Transient Sources with POLAR,True,"Extreme mass-ratio inspirals~(EMRIs) detectable by the Laser Inteferometric Space Antenna~(LISA) are unique probes of astrophysics and fundamental physics. Parameter estimation for these sources is challenging, especially because the waveforms are long, complicated, known only numerically, and slow to compute in the most relevant regime, where the dynamics is relativistic. We perform a time-consuming Fisher-matrix error analysis of the EMRI parameters using fully-relativistic numerical waveforms to leading order in an adiabatic expansion on a Kerr background, taking into account the motion of the LISA constellation, higher harmonics, and also including the leading correction from the spin of the secondary in the post-adiabatic approximation. We pay particular attention to the convergence of the numerical derivatives in the Fisher matrix and to the numerical stability of the covariance matrix, which for some systems requires computing the numerical waveforms with approximately $90$-digit precision. Our analysis confirms previous results (obtained with approximated but much more computationally efficient waveforms) for the measurement errors on the binary's parameters. We also show that the inclusion of higher harmonics improves the errors on the luminosity distance and on the orbital angular momentum angles by one order and two orders of magnitude, respectively, which might be useful to identify the environments where EMRIs live. We particularly focus on the measurability of the spin of the secondary, confirming that it cannot be measured with sufficient accuracy. However, due to correlations, its inclusion in the waveform model can deteriorate the accuracy on the measurements of other parameters by orders of magnitude, unless a physically-motivated prior on the secondary spin is imposed.","Polarization measurements of the gamma-ray component of transient sources are of great scientific interest, they are however, also highly challenging. This is due to the typical low signal to noise and the potential for significant systematic errors. Both issues are made worse by the transient nature of the events which prompt one to observe a large portion of the sky. The POLAR instrument was designed as a dedicated transient gamma-ray polarimeter. It made use of a large effective area and large field of view to maximize the signal to noise as well as the number of observed transients. Additionally, it was calibrated carefully on ground and in orbit to mitigate systematic errors. The main scientific goal of POLAR was to measure the polarization of the prompt emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts. During the 6 months operation in orbit POLAR observed 55 Gamma-Ray Bursts of which 14 were bright enough to allow for constraining polarization measurements. In this chapter we mainly discuss about the POLAR instrument along with the calibration and analysis procedures. Two analyses are described, the first is a straightforward method previously implemented in polarization measurements, whilst the second was developed to improve the sensitivity and to mitigate several of the issues with the former.

Condensate fraction in a 2D Bose gas measured across the Mott-insulator transition,Local field of magnetic islands: role of their shape,True,"We realize a single-band 2D Bose-Hubbard system with Rb atoms in an optical lattice and measure the condensate fraction as a function of lattice depth, crossing from the superfluid to the Mott-insulating phase. We quantitatively identify the location of the superfluid to normal transition by observing when the condensed fraction vanishes.

I consider three kinds of elongated magnetic islands: ellipse-, diamond- and rectangular shaped islands which were magnetized uniformly along long axis. This report concentrates on the role of their shape upon distribution of the field. Calculations show that unlike rectangular-shaped magnet, ellipse-shaped and diamond-shaped ones produce much more localized field in proximity of its magnetic poles. Additionally in the case of ellipse-shaped islands the magnitude of induced field is large. This two facts favor arrays of ellipse-shaped magnetic islands to build zero-dimensional spin traps in a hybrid based on Ferromagnet/Semiconductor structure.",Other Condensed Matter,Other condensed matter in physics focuses on topics that fall outside the scope of more specific categories.

Two-dimensional easy-plane SU$(3)$ magnet with the transverse field: Anisotropy-driven multicriticality,Equivalence of Spatial and Particle Entanglement Growth After a Quantum Quench,True,"The two-dimensional easy-plane SU$(3)$ magnet subjected to the transverse field was investigated with the exact-diagonalization method. So far, as to the $XY$ model (namely, the easy-plane SU$(2)$ magnet), the transverse-field-driven order-disorder phase boundary has been investigated with the exact-diagonalization method, and it was claimed that the end-point singularity (multicriticality) at the $XX$-symmetric point does not accord with large-$N$-theory's prediction. Aiming to reconcile the discrepancy, we extend the internal symmetry to the easy-plane SU$(3)$ with the anisotropy parameter $\eta$, which interpolates the isotropic ($\eta=0$) and fully anisotropic ($\eta=1$) cases smoothly. As a preliminary survey, setting $\eta=1$, we analyze the order-disorder phase transition through resorting to the fidelity susceptibility $\chi_F$, which exhibits a pronounced signature for the criticality. Thereby, with $\eta$ scaled carefully, the $\chi_F$ data are cast into the crossover-scaling formula so as to determine the crossover exponent $\phi$, which seems to reflect the extension of the internal symmetry group to SU(3).","We analyze fermions after an interaction quantum quench in one spatial dimension and study the growth of the steady state entanglement entropy density under either a spatial mode or particle bipartition. For integrable lattice models, we find excellent agreement between the increase of spatial and particle entanglement entropy, and for chaotic models, an examination of two further neighbor interaction strengths suggests similar correspondence.

Localization Transition in a Ballistic Quantum Wire,Bilayer Insulator Tunnel Barriers for Graphene-Based Vertical Hot-electron Transistors,True,"The many-body wave-function of an interacting one-dimensional electron system is probed, focusing on the low-density, strong interaction regime. The properties of the wave-function are determined using tunneling between two long, clean, parallel quantum wires in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, allowing for gate-controlled electron density. As electron density is lowered to a critical value the many-body state abruptly changes from an extended state with a well-defined momentum to a localized state with a wide range of momentum components. The signature of the localized states appears as discrete tunneling features at resonant gate-voltages, corresponding to the depletion of single electrons and showing Coulomb-blockade behavior. Typically 5-10 such features appear, where the one-electron state has a single-lobed momentum distribution, and the few-electron states have double-lobed distributions with peaks at $\pm k_F$. A theoretical model suggests that for a small number of particles (N<6), the observed state is a mixture of ground and thermally excited spin states.","Vertical graphene-based device concepts that rely on quantum mechanical tunneling are intensely being discussed in literature for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. In this work, the carrier transport mechanisms in semiconductor-insulator-graphene (SIG) capacitors are investigated with respect to their suitability as the electron emitter in vertical graphene base transistors (GBTs). Several dielectric materials as tunnel barriers are compared, including dielectric double layers. Using bilayer dielectrics, we experimentally demonstrate significant improvements in the electron injection current by promoting Fowler-Nordheim tunneling (FNT) and step tunneling (ST) while suppressing defect mediated carrier transports. High injected tunneling current densities approaching 10$^3$ A/cm$^2$ (limited by series resistance), and excellent current-voltage nonlinearity and asymmetry are achieved using a 1 nm-thick high quality dielectric, thulium silicate (TmSiO), as the first insulator layer, and titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) as a high electron affinity second layer insulator. We also confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach in a full GBT structure which shows dramatic improvement in the collector on-state current density with respect to the previously reported GBTs.

Techniques for High Contrast Imaging in Multi-Star Systems I: Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control,Characterization of a silicon photomultiplier for the Ultra-Fast Astronomy telescope,True,"Extra-solar planets direct imaging is now a reality with the deployment and commissioning of the first generation of specialized ground-based instruments (GPI, SPHERE, P1640 and SCExAO). These systems allow of planets $ 10 ^ 7 $ times fainter than their host star. For space-based missions (EXCEDE, EXO-C, EXO-S, WFIRST), various teams have demonstrated laboratory contrasts reaching $ 10 ^ { -10 } $ within a few diffraction limits from the star. However, all of these current and future systems are designed to detect faint planets around a single host star or unresolved multiples, while most non M-dwarf stars such as Alpha Centauri belong to multi-star systems. Direct imaging around binaries/multiple systems at a level of contrast allowing Earth-like planet detection is challenging because the region of interest is contaminated by the hosts star companion as well as the host Generally, the light leakage is caused by both diffraction and aberrations in the system. Moreover, the region of interest usually falls outside the correcting zone of the deformable mirror (DM) for the companion. Until now, it has been thought that removing the light of a companion star is too challenging, leading to the exclusion of binary systems from target lists of direct imaging coronographic missions. In this paper, we will show different new techniques for high-contrast imaging of planets around multi-star systems and detail the Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control (SNWC) method, which allows to control wavefront errors beyond nominal control region of the DM. Using the SNWC we reached contrasts around $ 5 \times 10 ^ { -9 } $ in a 10% bandwidth.","We characterized the S13360-3050CS Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC), a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K..

Thermodynamic interpretation of the de Sitter swampland conjecture,Open Wilson Lines in Noncommutative Gauge Theory and Tomography of Holographic Dual Supergravity,True,"We interpret the de Sitter swampland conjecture in the thermodynamic point of view. When the number of degrees of freedom is enhanced as the modulus rolls down the potential, the bound on $m_{\rm Pl} \nabla V/V$ is equivalent to the condition for the positive temperature phase. The boundary between the positive- and the negative temperature phases is preferred by the classical system since the entropy density is maximized. The distance conjecture imposes that (quasi-)de Sitter spacetime is entirely in the negative temperature phase and statistically disfavored. By investigating the concave potential, we also justify the bound on $m_{\rm Pl}^2 \nabla^2 V/V$.","We study the issue of gauge-invariant observables in d=4, N=4 noncommutative gauge theory and UV-IR relation therein.

The influence of star formation history on the gravitational wave signal from close double degenerates in the thin disc,OGLE-2016-BLG-1469L: Microlensing Binary Composed of Brown Dwarfs,True,"The expected gravitational wave (GW) signal due to double degenerates (DDs) in the thin Galactic disc is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The number of young close DDs that will contribute observable discrete signals in the frequency range $1.58 - 15.8$ mHz is estimated by comparison with the sensitivity of proposed GW observatories. The present-day DD population is examined as a function of Galactic star-formation history alone.

A Near-Infrared Chemical Inventory of the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e,Assessing $TESS$'s Yield of Rocky Planets Around Nearby M Dwarfs,True,"We present high-resolution near-infrared spectra taken during eight transits of 55 Cancri e, a nearby low-density super-Earth with a short orbital period (< 18 hours). While this exoplanet's bulk density indicates a possible atmosphere, one has not been detected definitively. Our analysis relies on the Doppler cross-correlation technique, which takes advantage of the high spectral resolution and broad wavelength coverage of our data, to search for the thousands of absorption features from hydrogen-, carbon-, and nitrogen-rich molecular species in the planetary atmosphere. Although we are unable to detect an atmosphere around 55 Cancri e, we do place strong constraints on the levels of HCN, NH${}_3$, and C${}_2$H${}_2$ that may be present. In particular, at a mean molecular weight of 5 amu we can rule out the presence of HCN in the atmosphere down to a volume mixing ratio (VMR) of 0.02%, NH${}_3$ down to a VMR of 0.08%, and C${}_2$H${}_2$ down to a VMR of 1.0%. If the mean molecular weight is relaxed to 2 amu, we can rule out the presence of HCN, NH${}_3$, and C${}_2$H${}_2$ down to VMRs of 0.001%, 0.0025%, and 0.08% respectively. Our results reduce the parameter space of possible atmospheres consistent with the analysis of HST/WFC3 observations by Tsiaras et al. (2016), and indicate that if 55 Cancri e harbors an atmosphere, it must have a high mean molecular weight and/or clouds.","Terrestrial planets are easier to detect around M dwarfs than other types of stars, making them promising for next-generation atmospheric characterization studies. The $TESS$ mission has greatly increased the number of known M dwarf planets that we can use to perform population studies, allowing us to explore how the rocky planet occurrence rate varies with host radius, following in the footsteps of past work with $Kepler$ data. In this paper, we use simulations to assess $TESS$'s yield of small ($0.5\,R_\oplus \,<\,R_p\,<\,2\,R_\oplus$) planet candidates around nearby ($d\,<\,30$ pc) M dwarfs. We highlight the underappreciated fact that while $TESS$ was indeed expected to find a large number of planets around M dwarfs overall, it was not expected to have a high planetary yield for the latest M dwarfs. Furthermore, we find that $TESS$ has detected fewer planets around stars with $R_*\,<\,0.3 R_\odot$ than even was expected (11 observed vs. $24\,\pm\,5$ expected). We find evidence that the photometric noise of stars in the $TESS$ bandpass increases with decreasing radius for M dwarfs. However, this trend cannot explain the observed distribution of planets. Our main conclusions are: (1) the planet occurrence rate likely doesn't increase, and may decrease for the latest M dwarfs; and (2) there are at least 17, and potentially three times that number, transiting planets around nearby late M dwarfs that still won't be detected by the end of $TESS$'s 4th year.",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"Earth and planetary astrophysics focuses on interplanetary medium, planetary physics, planetary astrobiology, extrasolar planets, comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

Integration of Superforms and Super-Thom Class,Dissipative effects in finite density holographic superfluids,True,"We address the basic problem of constructing the Thom class for a supermanifold. Given a cohomological class of a supermanifold and the restriction of the supermanifold to its bosonic submanifold, the Thom class gives a prescription to define the integral over the bosonic submanifold in terms of the integral over the entire supermanifold. In addition, we provide some new interesting examples of supermanifolds obtained by extending a given bosonic manifold, we discuss the construction of superforms of special type (which transform as Berezinian under change of supercoordinates) and we define the de Rham cohomology. We review the construction of the Thom class in the conventional geometry and we discuss the extension to the supermanifolds. Then, we compute explicitly the Thom class for the case of CP^{(1|2)} and, as expected, the result is singular. We provide a regularization technique to handle the fermionic Thom class in practical applications. We conclude with some remarks about Calabi-Yau spaces and their embedding into super-CY.","We derive the leading dissipative corrections of holographic superfluids at finite temperature and chemical potential by employing our recently developed techniques to study dissipative effects in the hydrodynamic limit of holographic theories. As part of our results, we express the incoherent conductivity, the shear and the three bulk viscosities in terms of thermodynamics and the black hole horizon data of the dual bulk geometries. We use our results to show that all three bulk viscosities exhibit singular behaviour close to the critical point.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Impact of the Design Parameters on the Microwave Displacement Sensor Performance,A resistance bridge based on a cryogenic current comparator achieving sub-$10^{-9}$ measurement uncertainties,True,"The investigations have been conducted on the involved design parameters to analyze the behavior of the microwave displacement sensor output characteristics. To implement this, a dielectric resonator loaded to a reflection mode operated microstrip line circuit is proposed. For the proposed reflection mode sensor, the sensor features like resonant frequency, impedance matching position, sensitivity, and dynamic range are sensitive to the displacement of DR to microstrip line. The impact of the substrate shape and size, and resonators geometrical properties are numerically analyzed and experimentally validated by using VNA. The sensor analysis shows good matching between both HFSS simulations and VNA measurements.","A new resistance bridge has been built at the Laboratoire national de m\'etrologie et d'essais (LNE) to improve the ohm realization in the $Syst\`eme International$ (SI) of units from the quantum Hall effect. We describe the instrument, the performance of which relies on two synchronized and noise-filtered current sources, an accurate and stable current divider and a cryogenic current comparator (CCC) having a low noise of $\mathrm{80~pA.t/Hz^{1/2}}$.

Azimuthal asymmetries in single polarized proton-proton Drell-Yan processes,A model-independent analysis of the dependence of the anomalous J/psi suppression on the number of participant nucleons,True,"We study the azimuthal asymmetries in proton-proton Drell-Yan processes with one incident proton being transversely or longitudinally polarized. We consider particularly the asymmetries contributed by the leading-twist chiral-odd quark distributions. We analyze the asymmetries with $\sin(2\phi+\phi_S)$ and $\sin(2\phi-\phi_S)$ modulations in transverse single polarized $p^\uparrow p$ Drell-Yan and $\sin2\phi$ asymmetries in longitudinal single polarized $p^\rightarrow p$ Drell-Yan at RHIC, J-PARC, E906 (Fermi Lab) and NICA (JINR). We show that the measurements of the asymmetries in those facilities can provide valuable information of the chiral-odd structure of the nucleon both in the valence and sea regions.","A recently published experimental dependence of the J/psi to Drell-Yan ratio on the measured, by a zero degree calorimeter, forward energy E_ZDC in Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS is analyzed. Using a model-independent approach it is shown that the data are at variance with an earlier published experimental dependence of the same quantity on the transverse energy of neutral hadrons E_T. The discrepancy is related to a moderate centrality region: 100 < N_p < 200 (N_p is the number of participant nucleons) and is peculiar only to the data obtained within the `minimum bias' analysis (using the `theoretical Drell-Yan'). This could result from systematic experimental errors in the minimum bias sample. A possible source of the errors is discussed.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Self-Repolarization process in dual-Omnipolarizers,Focal Properties of Planar Curvilinear Mirrors Applied to Hydrodynamic Soliton Analysis,True,"We report on an extension of the concept of nonlinear self-repolarization process by means of two different architectures based on dual-Omnipolarizers. More specifically, we compare the performance in terms of polarization attraction capabilities provided by two novel arrangements: The first configuration relies on two cascaded Omnipolarizers, whilst the second architecture integrates an additional device directly into the feedback loop. Our study reveals that for a constant power budget, the cascading of two subsequent Omnipolarizers enables to improve the efficiency of the attraction process, yielding an output Degree-of-Polarization close to unity, but at the cost of twofold equipments.","The free surface of hydrodynamic waves behaves as a time-varying planar curvilinear mirror, whose focal properties determine the light intensity distribution in a reflected light beam. Variational criteria for determination of foci of planar curvilinear mirrors illuminated by a coplanar light source are studied in the realm of Geometric Optics. Intrinsic functions of the optical setup (called focal potentials in the text) which are stationary at mirror points corresponding to cusp points of the caustic of reflected light rays are analyzed. The eccentricity of the osculating conic defined at each mirror point is shown to be a dimensionless, coordinate independent focal potential.

Transient Exchange Interaction in a Helical Antiferromagnet,Multipeak quasielastic light scattering and high-frequency electronic excitations in honeycomb Li$_2$RuO$_3$,True,We have performed time-resolved resonant x-ray scattering studies in the Lanthanide metal Dy to reveal the dynamic response of the helical order exchange coupling to injection of unpolarized spins. The observed spin dynamics are significantly slower than that exhibited by the ferromagnetic phase in Lanthanide metals and are strongly dependent on temperature and excitation fluence. This unique behavior results from transient changes in the shape of the conduction electron Fermi surface and subsequent scattering events that transfer the excitation to the core spin.,"We measured the temperature dependence of low-frequency Raman spectra in Li$_2$RuO$_3$, and observed multipeak quasielastic scattering in the Ru honeycomb polarizations below and above the magnetostructural transition temperature. We attribute this scattering to the fluctuations of the energy density in the spin system. High-frequency electronic light scattering was observed at 2150 $cm^{-1}$. Its intensity increased significantly below the transition temperature, confirming substantial modification of electronic structure due to removal of degeneracy in $t_{2g}$-manifold of Ru$^{4+}$ ions.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Resolving the extended atmosphere and the inner wind of Mira ($o$ Ceti) with long ALMA baselines,Fast Calculation of the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram Using Graphics Processing Units,True,"The prototypical Mira variable, $o$ Cet (Mira), has been observed as a Science Verification target in the 2014 ALMA Long Baseline Campaign with a longest baseline of 15 km. ALMA clearly resolves the images of the continuum and molecular line emission/absorption at an angular resolution of ~30 mas at 220 GHz. We image the data of the $^{28}$SiO v=0, 2 $J$=5-4 and H$_2$O $\nu_2$=1 $J(K_a,K_c)$=5(5,0)-6(4,3) transitions and extract spectra from various lines-of-sight towards Mira's extended atmosphere. In the course of imaging, we encountered ambiguities in the resulting images and spectra that appear to be related to the performance of the CLEAN algorithm. We resolve Mira's millimetre continuum emission and our data are consistent with a radio photosphere with a brightness temperature of 2611$\pm$51 K, in agreement with recent results obtained with the VLA. We do not confirm the existence of a compact region (<5 mas) of enhanced brightness. We derive the gas density, kinetic temperature, molecular abundance and outflow/infall velocities in Mira's extended atmosphere by modelling the SiO and H$_2$O lines. We find that SiO-bearing gas starts to deplete beyond 4$R_\star$ and at a kinetic temperature of $\lesssim$600 K. The inner dust shells are probably composed of grain types other than pure silicates. During this observation, Mira's atmosphere generally exhibited infall motion, with a shock front of velocity $\lesssim$12 km/s outside the radio photosphere. The structures predicted by the hydrodynamical model CODEX can reproduce the observed spectra in astonishing detail; while some other models fail when confronted with the new data. Combined with radiative transfer modelling, ALMA successfully demonstrates the ability to reveal the physical conditions of the extended atmospheres and inner winds of AGB stars in unprecedented detail.

Higher winding number in a non-unitary photonic quantum walk,Relaxation of a Colloidal Particle into a Nonequilibrium Steady State,True,"Topological matter exhibits exotic properties yet phases characterized by large topological invariants are difficult to implement, despite rapid experimental progress. A promising route toward higher topological invariants is via engineered Floquet systems, particularly in photonics, where flexible control holds the potential of extending the study of conventional topological matter to novel regimes. Here we implement a one-dimensional photonic quantum walk to explore large winding numbers. By introducing partial measurements and hence loss into the system, we detect winding numbers of three and four in multi-step non-unitary quantum walks, which agree well with theoretical predictions. Moreover, by probing statistical moments of the walker, we identify locations of topological phase transitions in the system, and reveal the breaking of pseudo-unitary near topological phase boundaries. As the winding numbers are associated with non-unitary time evolution, our investigation enriches understanding of topological phenomena in non-unitary settings.","We study the relaxation of a single colloidal sphere which is periodically driven between two nonequilibrium steady states. Experimentally, this is achieved by driving the particle along a toroidal trap imposed by scanned optical tweezers. We find that the relaxation time after which the probability distributions have been relaxed is identical to that obtained by a steady state measurement. In quantitative agreement with theoretical calculations the relaxation time strongly increases when driving the system further away from thermal equilibrium.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition in Two-Dimensional Dipolar Stripes,Temperature-driven crossover in the Lieb-Liniger model,True,"A two-dimensional quantum system of dipoles, with a polarization angle not perpendicular to the plane, shows a transition from a gas to a stripe phase. We have studied the thermal properties of these two phases using the path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method. By simulating the thermal density matrix, PIMC provides exact results for magnitudes of interest such as the superfluid fraction and the one-body density matrix. As it is well known, in two dimensions the superfluid-to-normal phase transition follows the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) scenario. Our results show that both the anisotropic gas and the stripe phases follow the BKT scaling laws. At fixed density and increasing the tilting angle, the transition temperature decreases in going from the gas to the stripe phase. Superfluidity in the perpendicular direction to the stripes is rather small close to the critical temperature but it becomes larger at lower temperatures, mainly close to the transition to the gas. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the supersolidity observed recently in a quasi-one-dimensional array of dipolar droplets.",The large-distance behavior of the density-density correlation function in the Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature is investigated by means of the recently derived nonlinear integral equations characterizing the correlation lengths. We present extensive numerical results covering all the physical regimes fromweak to strong interaction and all temperatures. We find that the leading term of the asymptotic expansion becomes oscillatory at a critical temperature which decreases with the strength of the interaction. As we approach the Tonks-Girardeau limit the asymptotic behavior becomes more complex with a double crossover of the largest and next-largest correlation lengths.

Quasifission dynamics in TDHF,Probing universal dynamics with topological data analysis in a gluonic plasma,True,"For light and medium mass systems the capture cross-section may be considered to be the same as that for complete fusion, whereas for heavy systems leading to superheavy formations the evaporation residue cross-section is dramatically reduced due to the quasifission (QF) and fusion-fission processes thus making the capture cross-section to be essentially the sum of these two cross-sections, with QF occurring at a much shorter time-scale. Consequently, quasifission is the primary reaction mechanism that limits the formation of superheavy nuclei. Within the last few years the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) approach has been utilized for studying the dynamics of quasifission. The study of quasifission is showing a great promise to provide insight based on very favorable comparisons with experimental data. In this article we will focus on the TDHF calculations of quasifission observables for the $^{48}$Ca+$^{249}$Bk system.","We study nonequilibrium dynamics of SU(2) lattice gauge theory in Minkowski space-time in a classical-statistical regime, where characteristic gluon occupancies are much larger than unity. In this strongly correlated system far from equilibrium, the correlations of energy and topological densities show self-similar behavior related to a turbulent cascade towards higher momentum scales. We employ persistent homology to infer topological features of the gluonic plasma via a hierarchy of simplicial and cubical complexes. All topological observables under investigation are also manifestly gauge invariant and are shown to exhibit self-similar evolution, which relate the spatial and temporal properties of the plasma in terms of universal scaling exponents and functions.

Position distribution in a generalised run and tumble process,Linear and anomalous front propagation in system with non Gaussian diffusion: the importance of tails,True,"We study a class of stochastic processes of the type $\frac{d^n x}{dt^n}= v_0\, \sigma(t)$ where $n>0$ is a positive integer and $\sigma(t)=\pm 1$ represents an `active' telegraphic noise that flips from one state to the other with a constant rate $\gamma$. For $n=1$, it reduces to the standard run and tumble process for active particles in one dimension. This process can be analytically continued to any $n>0$ including non-integer values. We compute exactly the mean squared displacement at time $t$ for all $n>0$ and show that at late times while it grows as $\sim t^{2n-1}$ for $n>1/2$, it approaches a constant for $n<1/2$. In the marginal case $n=1/2$, it grows very slowly with time as $\sim \ln t$. Thus the process undergoes a {\em localisation} transition at $n=1/2$. We also show that the position distribution $p_n(x,t)$ remains time-dependent even at late times for $n\ge 1/2$, but approaches a stationary time-independent form for $n<1/2$. The tails of the position distribution at late times exhibit a large deviation form, $p_n(x,t)\sim \exp\left[-\gamma\, t\, \Phi_n\left(\frac{x}{x^*(t)}\right)\right]$, where $x^*(t)= v_0\, t^n/\Gamma(n+1)$. We compute the rate function $\Phi_n(z)$ analytically for all $n>0$ and also numerically using importance sampling methods, finding excellent agreement between them. For three special values $n=1$, $n=2$ and $n=1/2$ we compute the exact cumulant generating function of the position distribution at all times $t$.","We investigate front propagation in systems with diffusive and sub-diffusive behavior. The scaling behavior of moments of the diffusive problem, both in the standard and in the anomalous cases, is not enough to determine the features of the reactive front. In fact, the shape of the bulk of the probability distribution of the transport process, which determines the diffusive properties, is important just for pre-asymptotic behavior of front propagation, while the precise shape of the tails of the probability distribution determines asymptotic behavior of front propagation.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

$\rho$-Meson Production and Decay in Proton-Nucleus Collisions,Tomography of the Quark Gluon Plasma by Heavy Quarks,True,"We analyze the production of $\rho$-mesons in $p + A$ reactions including both the production by proton-nucleon as well as pion-nucleon collisions within a coupled channel transport approach. The final state interactions of the $\rho$-meson with nucleons are evaluated from a resonance model which allows to extract elastic and inelastic cross sections. We include the latter final state interactions, the $\rho$-meson decay into two pions as well as the final pion-nucleon interactions within the transport approach. We find the invariant mass distribution of pion pairs to be sensitive to the $\rho$-meson properties in the nuclear medium. However, due to the strong final state interactions of pions only light targets like $^{12}C$ might be suited to extract a $\rho$-signal from the uncorrelated two pion background which carries information about the in-medium properties of the $\rho$-meson.","Using the recently published model \cite{Gossiaux:2008jv,goss2} for the collisional energy loss of heavy quarks in a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), based on perturbative QCD (pQCD), we study the centrality dependence of $R_{AA}$ and $R_{AA}(p_T^{min})$, %= \frac{dN_{AA}/dp_T}{<N_{binary}> dN_{pp}/dp_T}$ measured by the Phenix collaboration, and compare our model with other approaches based on pQCD and on Anti de Sitter/ Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT)",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

CO$_2$ Infrared Phonon Modes in Interstellar Ice Mixtures,Complex organic molecules detected in twelve high-mass star-forming regions with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA),True,"CO$_2$ ice is an important reservoir of carbon and oxygen in star and planet forming regions. Together with water and CO, CO$_2$ sets the physical and chemical characteristics of interstellar icy grain mantles, including desorption and diffusion energies for other ice constituents. A detailed understanding of CO$_2$ ice spectroscopy is a prerequisite to characterize CO$_2$ interactions with other volatiles both in interstellar ices and in laboratory experiments of interstellar ice analogs. We report laboratory spectra of the CO$_2$ longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode in pure CO$_2$ ice and in CO$_2$ ice mixtures with H$_2$O, CO, O$_2$ components. We show that the LO phonon mode position is sensitive to the mixing ratio of various ice components of astronomical interest. In the era of JWST, this characteristic could be used to constrain interstellar ice compositions and morphologies. More immediately, LO phonon mode spectroscopy provides a sensitive probe of ice mixing in the laboratory and should thus enable diffusion measurements with higher precision than has been previously possible.","Recent astrochemical models and experiments have explained that complex organic molecules (COMs; molecules composed of six or more atoms) are produced on the dust grain mantles in cold and dense gas in prestellar cores. However, the detailed chemical processes and the roles of physical conditions on chemistry are still far from understood. To address these questions, we investigated twelve high-mass star-forming regions using the ALMA band 6 observations. They are associated with 44/95GHz class I and 6.7 GHz class II CH$_{3}$OH masers, indicative of undergoing active accretion. We found 28 hot cores with COMs emission among 68 continuum peaks at 1.3 mm and specified 10 hot cores associated with 6.7 GHz class II CH$_{3}$OH masers. Up to 19 COMs are identified including oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing molecules and their isotopologues in cores. The derived abundances show a good agreement with those from other low- and high-mass star-forming regions, implying that the COMs chemistry is predominantly set by the ice chemistry in the prestellar core stage. One clear trend is that the COMs detection rate steeply grows with the gas column density, which can be attributed to the efficient formation of COMs in dense cores. In addition, cores associated with a 6.7 GHz class II CH$_{3}$OH maser tend to be enriched with COMs. Finally, our results suggest that the enhanced abundances of several molecules in our hot cores could be originated by the active accretion as well as different physical conditions of cores.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Tuning the magnetic properties of Fe50-xMnxPt50 thin films,Six-Dimensional Quantum Dynamics of Adsorption and Desorption of H_2 at Pd(100): Steering and Steric Effects,True,"The magnetic and structural properties of highly ordered (S ~ 0.82) epitaxial Fe50-xMnxPt50 thin films were investigated. We report the change in the magnetic properties of Mn doped FePt epitaxial thin films. This study differs from the earlier experimental studies on Mn doped FePt based alloys. Ordered L10 Fe50-xMnxPt50 (x=0, 6, 9, 12 and 15) thin films with a constant thickness of 45 nm were prepared by co-sputtering Fe50Pt50 and Mn50Pt50 on to MgO (100) single crystal substrate. We find a significant increase in the coercivity for Fe-Mn-Pt thin films. We have shown that this increase in magnetic properties coincide with the tetragonal distortion, while the recent first principles study of Mn doped FePt showed the sub lattice ordering of ferromagnetically aligned Mn atoms would lead to increase in magnetic properties in the FeMnPt ternary alloy system with fixed Pt concentration. At x=12 the coercivity has increased by 46.4 % when compared to Fe50Pt50. The increase in magnetic properties in Fe50-xMnxPt50 is due to the tetragonal distortion as experimental c/a ratio is larger than the expected c/a ratio for ferromagnetically ordered Mn atoms in the sublattice at the concentration x=12. Thus we show that high temperature deposition and high temperature annealing is one of the methods to achieve large coercivity in Mn doped FePt as it leads to tetragonal distortion.","We report the first six-dimensional quantum dynamical calculations of dissociative adsorption and associative desorption. Using a potential energy surface obtained by density functional theory calculations, we show that the initial decrease of the sticking probability with increasing kinetic energy in the system H_2/Pd(100), which is usually attributed to the existence of a molecular adsorption state, is due to dynamical steering.

Has JWST already falsified dark-matter-driven galaxy formation?,The AIMSS Project I: Bridging the Star Cluster - Galaxy Divide,True,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered several luminous high-redshift galaxy candidates with stellar masses of $M_{*} \gtrsim 10^{9} \, \rm{M_{\odot}}$ at photometric redshifts $z_{\mathrm{phot}} \gtrsim 10$ which allows to constrain galaxy and structure formation models. For example, Adams et al. identified the candidate ID 1514 with $\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) = {9.8}_{-0.2}^{+0.2}$ located at $z_{\mathrm{phot}} = 9.85_{-0.12}^{+0.18}$ and Naidu et al. found even more distant candidates labeled as GL-z11 and GL-z13 with $\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) = 9.4_{-0.3}^{+0.3}$ at $z_{\mathrm{phot}}=10.9_{-0.4}^{+0.5}$ and $\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) = 9.0_{-0.4}^{+0.3}$ at $z_{\mathrm{phot}} = 13.1_{-0.7}^{+0.8}$, respectively. Assessing the computations of the IllustrisTNG (TNG50-1 and TNG100-1) and EAGLE projects, we investigate if the stellar mass buildup as predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm is consistent with these observations assuming that the early JWST calibration is correct and that the candidates are indeed located at $z \gtrsim 10$. Galaxies formed in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm are by more than an order of magnitude less massive in stars than the observed galaxy candidates implying that the stellar mass buildup is more efficient in the early Universe than predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM models. This in turn would suggest that structure formation is more enhanced at $z \gtrsim 10$ than predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We show that different star formation histories could reduce the stellar masses of the galaxy candidates alleviating the tension. Finally, we calculate the galaxy-wide initial mass function (gwIMF) of the galaxy candidates assuming the integrated galaxy IMF theory. The gwIMF becomes top-heavy for metal-poor starforming galaxies decreasing therewith the stellar masses compared to an invariant canonical IMF.","We describe the structural and kinematic properties of the first compact stellar systems discovered by the AIMSS project. These spectroscopically confirmed objects have sizes ($\sim$6 $<$ R$_{\rm e}$ [pc] $<$ 500) and masses ($\sim$2$\times$10$^{6}$ $<$ M$_*$/M$_\odot$ $<$ 6$\times$10$^{9}$) spanning the range of massive globular clusters (GCs), ultra compact dwarfs (UCDs) and compact elliptical galaxies (cEs), completely filling the gap between star clusters and galaxies. Several objects are close analogues to the prototypical cE, M32. These objects, which are more massive than previously discovered UCDs of the same size, further call into question the existence of a tight mass-size trend for compact stellar systems, while simultaneously strengthening the case for a universal ""zone of avoidance"" for dynamically hot stellar systems in the mass-size plane. Overall, we argue that there are two classes of compact stellar systems: 1) massive star clusters and 2) a population closely related to galaxies. Our data provide indications for a further division of the galaxy-type UCD/cE population into two groups, one population that we associate with objects formed by the stripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies, and a second population that formed through the stripping of bulged galaxies or are lower-mass analogues of classical ellipticals. We find compact stellar systems around galaxies in low to high density environments, demonstrating that the physical processes responsible for forming them do not only operate in the densest clusters.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Towards physics responsible for large-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ forest bias parameters,The Substructure Hierarchy in Dark Matter Haloes,True,"Using a series of carefully constructed numerical experiments based on hydrodynamic cosmological SPH simulations, we attempt to build an intuition for the relevant physics behind the large scale density ($b_\delta$) and velocity gradient ($b_\eta$) biases of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Starting with the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation applied to the smoothed total density field in real-space, and progressing through redshift-space with no thermal broadening, redshift-space with thermal broadening and hydrodynamicaly simulated baryon fields, we investigate how approximations found in the literature fare. We find that Seljak's 2012 analytical formulae for these bias parameters work surprisingly well in the limit of no thermal broadening and linear redshift-space distortions. We also show that his $b_\eta$ formula is exact in the limit of no thermal broadening. Since introduction of thermal broadening significantly affects its value, we speculate that a combination of large-scale measurements of $b_\eta$ and the small scale flux PDF might be a sensitive probe of the thermal state of the IGM. We find that large-scale biases derived from the smoothed total matter field are within 10-20\% to those based on hydrodynamical quantities, in line with other measurements in the literature.","We present a new algorithm for identifying the substructure within simulated dark matter haloes. The method is an extension of that proposed by Tormen et al. (2004) and Giocoli et al. (2008a), which identifies a subhalo as a group of self-bound particles that prior to being accreted by the main progenitor of the host halo belonged to one and the same progenitor halo (hereafter satellite). However, this definition does not account for the fact that these satellite haloes themselves may also have substructure, which thus gives rise to sub-subhaloes, etc. Our new algorithm identifies substructures at all levels of this hierarchy, and we use it to determine the mass function of all substructure (counting sub-haloes, sub-subhaloes, etc.). On average, haloes which formed more recently tend to have a larger mass fraction in substructure and to be less concentrated than average haloes of the same mass. We provide quantitative fits to these correlations. Even though our algorithm is very different from that of Gao et al. (2004), we too find that the subhalo mass function per unit mass at redshift z = 0 is universal. This universality extends to any redshift only if one accounts for the fact that host haloes of a given mass are less concentrated at higher redshifts, and concentration and substructure abundance are anti-correlated. This universality allows a simple parametrization of the subhalo mass function integrated over all host halo masses, at any given time. We provide analytic fits to this function which should be useful in halo model analyses which equate galaxies with halo substructure when interpreting clustering in large sky surveys. Finally, we discuss systematic differences in the subhalo mass function that arise from different definitions of (host) halo mass.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

ALMA imaging of the CO snowline of the HD 163296 disk with DCO+,Deuterium Enrichment of the Interstellar Medium,True,"The high spatial and line sensitivity of ALMA opens the possibility of resolving emission from molecules in circumstellar disks.

We vary the upper- and lower-limit temperatures of the region in which DCO+ is present as well as the abundance of DCO+ in order to fit channel maps of the DCO+ J=5-4 line. To determine the abundance enhancement compared to the general interstellar medium, we carry out similar fitting to HCO+ J=4-3 and H13CO+ J=4-3 observations. ALMA images show centrally peaked extended emission from HCO+ and H13CO+. DCO+ emission lies in a resolved ring from ~110 to 160 AU. The outer radius approximately corresponds to the size of the CO snowline as measured by previous lower resolution observations of CO lines in this disk. The ALMA DCO+ data now resolve and image the CO snowline directly. In the best fitting models, HCO+ exists in a region extending from the 19 K isotherm to the photodissociation layer with an abundance of 3x10^-10 relative to H2. DCO+ exists within the 19-21 K region of the disk with an abundance ratio [DCO+] / [HCO+] = 0.3. This represents a factor of 10^4 enhancement of the DCO+ abundance within this narrow region of the HD 163296 disk. Such a high enhancement has only previously been seen in prestellar cores. The inferred abundances provide a lower limit to the ionization fraction in the midplane of the cold outer disk (approximately greater than 4x10^-10), and suggest the utility of DCO+ as a tracer of its parent molecule H2D+. Abridged","Despite low elemental abundance of atomic deuterium in interstellar medium (ISM), observational evidences suggest that several species in gas-phase and in ices could be heavily fractionated. We explore various aspects of deuterium enrichment by constructing a chemical evolution model in gas and grain phases. Depending on various physical parameters, gas and grains are allowed to interact with each other through exchange of their chemical species. It is known that HCO+ and N2H+ are two abundant gas phase ions in ISM and their deuterium fractionation are generally used to predict degree of ionization in various regions of a molecular cloud. To have a more realistic estimation, we consider a density profile of a collapsing cloud. We present radial distributions of important interstellar molecules along with their deuterated isotopomers. We carry out quantum chemical simulation to study effects of isotopic substitution on spectral properties of these important interstellar species. We calculate vibrational (harmonic) frequency of the most important deuterated species (neutral & ions). Rotational and distortional constants of these molecules are also computed to predict rotational transitions of these species. We compare vibrational (harmonic) and rotational transitions as computed by us with existing observational, experimental and theoretical results.

Hadronic Parity-Violation on the Lattice,Resonance poles and threshold energies for hadron physical problems by a model-independent universal algorithm,True,"We motivate lattice QCD studies of the parity-violating pion-nucleon coupling constant and extend flavor-conserving hadronic parity-violation from QCD to partially-quenched QCD. The parity-violating pion-nucleon coupling and the anapole form factor (and moment) of the proton are computed to one-loop order in the partially-quenched chiral expansion. For the parity-violating pion-nucleon interaction, we include the contributions from total derivative operators necessary to match the kinematics that will be used in lattice simulations.","We show how complex resonance poles and threshold energies for systems in hadron physics can be accurately obtained by using a method based on the Pad\'{e}-approximant which was recently developed for the calculation of resonance poles for atomic and molecular auto-ionization systems. The main advantage of this method is the ability to calculate the resonance poles and threshold energies from \emph{real} spectral data. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of this method we apply it here to an analytical model as well as to experimental data for the squared modulus of the vector pion form factor, the S0 partial wave amplitude for $\pi\pi$ scattering and the cross section ratio $R(s)$ for $e^+e^-$ collisions. The extracted values for the resonance poles of the $\rho(770)$ and the $f_0(500)$ or $\sigma$ meson are in very good agreement with the literature. When the data are noisy the prediction of decay thresholds proves to be less accurate but feasible.",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

The Left-Right Symmetric Composite Higgs,Dependence of elastic hadron collisions on impact parameter,True,"We find the exchange symmetry between left and right handed top quark in composite Higgs model with partial compositeness is efficient to soften the Higgs potential and reduce fine tuning. This symmetry can keep the Higgs potential in top sector invariant under trigonometric parity $\sin (h/f) \leftrightarrow \cos (h/f)$ and thus the Higgs quadratic divergences can be completely cancelled, resulting a UV insensitive Higgs potential. We explicitly construct the minimal left-right symmetric model based on coset space $SO(6)/SO(5)$ which is locally isomorphic to $SU(4)/Sp(4)$ and thus has well defined fermionic UV completion. This UV completion can automatically keep Higgs potential in gauge sector finite even the gauge sector breaks this discrete symmetry. We find that the vector mesons can be very heavy while the colored top partners are relatively light ($>1.5$ TeV) to obtain a light Higgs.","Elastic proton-proton collisions represent probably the greatest ensemble of available measured data, the analysis of which may provide large amount of new physical results concerning fundamental particles. It is, however, necessary to analyze first some conclusions concerning pp collisions and their interpretations differing fundamentally from our common macroscopic experience. It has been argued, e.g., that elastic hadron collisions have been more central than inelastic ones, even if any explanation of the existence of so different process, i.e., elastic and inelastic (with hundreds of secondary particles) collisions, under the same conditions has not been given until now. The given conclusion has been based on a greater number of simplifying mathematical assumptions (done already in earlier calculations), without their influence on physical interpretation being analyzed and entitled; the corresponding influence has started to be studied in the approach based on eikonal model. The possibility of peripheral interpretation of elastic collisions will be demonstrated and corresponding results summarized. The arguments will be given why no preference may be given to the mentioned centrality against the standard peripheral behaviour.

Radiative coupling and weak lasing of exciton-polariton condensates,Sub-picosecond molecular dynamics modulate the energies of spin states for hundreds of nanoseconds,True,"In spite of having finite life-time exciton-polaritons in microcavities are known to condense at strong enough pumping of the reservoir. We present an analytical theory of such Bose-condensates on a set of localized one-particle states: condensation centers. To understand physics of these arrays one has to supplement the Josephson coupling by the radiative coupling caused by the interference of the light emitted by different centers. Combination of these couplings with the one-site interaction between the bosons leads to a rich nonlinear dynamics. In particular, a new regime of radiation appears. We call it weak lasing: the centers have macroscopic occupations and radiate coherently, but the coupling alone is sufficient for stabilization. The system can have several stable states and switch between them. Moreover, the time reversal symmetry in this regime is, as a rule, broken. A number of existing experimental puzzles find natural interpretation in the framework of this theory.","Molecular vibrations are increasingly seen as a key factor for spin dynamics in single-ion magnets and molecular spin qubits. Herein we show how an inexpensive combination of molecular dynamics calculations and a crystal field analysis can be employed to obtain a dynamical picture of the crystal field splitting. We present the time evolution during 500ns of the spin energy levels in a terbium complex. Our calculations evidence an amplitude of up to tens of cm-1 for the oscillations of the spin energy levels in the fs time scale. Crucially, we also see that the oscillations average out and practically disappear at longer time scales, thus ruling out the modulation of spin energy levels by phonons of long wavelength $\lambda$ (up to $\lambda$ = 40 $\AA$). Our results are compatible with the common approximation of focusing on local vibrations, but at the same time highlight the risks of assuming that the spin energy levels are time- and temperature-independent.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Inflation without Inflaton(s),Weyl-Dirac zero-mode for calorons,True,"We propose a model for early universe cosmology without the need for fundamental scalar fields. Cosmic acceleration and phenomenologically viable reheating of the universe results from a series of energy transitions, where during each transition vacuum energy is converted to thermal radiation. We show that this `cascading universe' can lead to successful generation of adiabatic density fluctuations and an observable gravity wave spectrum in some cases, where in the simplest case it reproduces a spectrum similar to slow-roll models of inflation. We also find the model provides a reasonable reheating temperature after inflation ends. This type of model may also be relevant for addressing the smallness of the vacuum energy today.",We give the analytic result for the fermion zero-mode of the SU(2) calorons with non-trivial holonomy.

The $1/N_c$ expansion in hadron effective field theory,Superscaling of Inclusive Electron Scattering from Nuclei,True,"We study the $N_c$ scalings of pion-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon scatterings and find that a consistent large $N_c$ counting can be established if we assume Witten's counting rules are applied to matrix elements or scattering amplitudes which use the relativistic normalization for the nucleons. With the pionless effective field theory, we also find that the $S$-wave nucleon-nucleon interaction is so strong that it should be treated nonperturbatively at the leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion. By summing all the leading order diagrams, we find that the deuteron binding energy is of order $1/N_c$. In contrast, meson-meson interaction is so weak that loosely-bound meson-meson molecular states may not exist in the large $N_c$ limit.","We investigate the degree to which the concept of superscaling, initially developed within the framework of the relativistic Fermi gas model, applies to inclusive electron scattering from nuclei. We find that data obtained from the low energy loss side of the quasielastic peak exhibit the superscaling property, i.e., the scaling functions f(\psi') are not only independent of momentum transfer (the usual type of scaling: scaling of the first kind), but coincide for A \geq 4 when plotted versus a dimensionless scaling variable \psi' (scaling of the second kind).

The pentaquark chain,Charm Physics at CDF II,True,"We discuss the differences between several partial-wave analysis formalisms used in the construction of three-body decay amplitudes involving fermions. Specifically, we consider the decay Lambda_b -> psi p K- , where the hidden charm pentaquark signal has been reported. We analyze the analytical properties of the amplitudes and separate kinematical and dynamical singularities.

Cosmography in $f(Q)$ gravity,The gravity duals of SO/USp superconformal quivers,True,"Cosmography is an ideal tool to investigate the cosmic expansion history of the Universe in a model-independent way. The equations of motion in modified theories of gravity are usually very complicated; cosmography may select practical models without imposing arbitrary choices a priori. We use the model-independent way to derive $f(z)$ and its derivatives up to fourth order in terms of measurable cosmographic parameters. We then fit those functions into the luminosity distance directly. We perform the MCMC analysis by considering three different sets of cosmographic functions. Using the largest supernovae Ia Pantheon sample, we derive the constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the cosmographic functions, and find that the former two terms in Taylor expansion of luminosity distance work dominantly in $f(Q)$ gravity.","We study the gravity duals of SO/USp superconformal quiver gauge theories realized by M5-branes wrapping on a Riemann surface (""G-curve"") together with a Z_2-quotient. When the G-curve has no punctures, the gravity solutions are classified by the genus g of the G-curve and the torsion part of the four-form flux G_4. We also find that there is an interesting relation between anomaly contributions from two mysterious theories: T_{SO(2N)} theory with SO(2N)^3 flavor symmetry and \tilde{T}_{SO(2N)} theory with SO(2N) x USp(2N-2)^2 flavor symmetry.

Scalar Dark Matter Candidates -- Revisited,Heavy quarkonia,True,"We revisit the possibility of light scalar dark matter, in the MeV to GeV mass bracket and coupled to electrons through fermion or vector mediators, in light of significant experimental and observational advances that probe new physics below the GeV-scale. We establish new limits from electron colliders and fixed-target beams, and derive the strength of loop-induced processes that are probed by precision physics, among other laboratory probes. In addition, we compute the cooling bound from SN1987A, consider self-scattering, structure formation, and cosmological constraints as well as the limits from dark matter-electron scattering in direct detection experiments. We then show that the combination of constraints largely excludes the possibility that the galactic annihilation of these particles may explain the long-standing INTEGRAL excess of 511 keV photons as observed in the galactic bulge. As caveat to these conclusions we identify the resonant annihilation regime where the vector mediator goes nearly on-shell.","Two complementary approaches to the theory of heavy quarkonia are discussed.

Constraints on jet formation mechanisms with the most energetic giant outbursts in MS 0735+7421,The Accretion of Gas onto Galaxies as Traced by their Satellites,True,"Giant X-ray cavities lie in some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) locating in central galaxies of clusters, most of these cavities are thought to be inflated by jets of AGNs. The jets can be either powered by rotating black holes or the accretion disks surrounding black holes, or both. In this work, we choose the most energetic cavity, MS 0735+7421, with stored energy ~ 10^62 erg, to constrain the jet formation mechanisms and the evolution of the central massive black hole in this source. The bolometric luminosity of the AGN in this cavity is ~ 10^(-5) L_Edd, however, the mean power of the jet required to inflate the cavity is estimated as ~ 0.02 L_Edd, which implies that the source has experienced strong outbursts previously. During outbursts, the jet power and the mass accretion rate should be significantly higher than its present values. We construct an accretion disk model, in which the angular momentum and energy carried away by jets is properly included, to calculate the spin and mass evolution of the massive black hole. In our calculations, different jet formation mechanisms are employed, and we find that the jets generated with the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism are unable to produce the giant cavity with ~ 10^62 erg in this source. Only the jets accelerated with the combination of the Blandford-Payne (BP) and BZ mechanisms can successfully inflate such a giant cavity, if the magnetic pressure is close to equipartition with the total (radiation+gas) pressure of the accretion disk. For dynamo generated magnetic field in the disk, such an energetic giant cavity can be inflated by the magnetically driven jets only if the initial black hole spin parameter a_0 > 0.95. Our calculations show that the final spin parameter a of the black hole is always ~ 0:9 - 0.998 for all the computational examples which can provide sufficient energy for the cavity of MS 0735+7421.","We have compiled a large sample of isolated central galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which do not have a neighbour of comparable brightness within a projected distance of 1 Mpc. We use the colours, luminosities and surface brightnesses of satellite galaxies in the vicinity of these objects to estimate their atomic gas content and to derive the average total mass of HI gas contained in satellites as a function of projected radius from the primary. Recent calibrations of merging timescales from N-body simulations are used to estimate the rate at which this gas will accrete onto the primaries. Our estimated accretion rates fall short of those needed to maintain the observed level of star formation in these systems by nearly two orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, there are strong correlations between the total mass of gas in satellites and the colours and specific star formation rates of central galaxies of all stellar masses. The correlations are much weaker if we consider the total stellar mass in the satellites, rather than their total gas mass. We ask why star formation in the central galaxies should be correlated with gas contained in satellites at projected separations of a Mpc or more, well outside the virial radius of the dark matter halos of these systems. We suggest that gas-rich satellites trace an underlying reservoir of ionized gas that is accreted continuously, and that provides the fuel for ongoing star formation in galaxies in the local Universe.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Long-Lived Vortex Structures in Collisional Pure and Gas-Discharge Nonneutral Electron Plasmas,Anomalies in Universal Intensity Scaling in Ultrarelativistic Laser-Plasma Interactions,True,"The analysis of experimental investigations of equilibrium, interaction and dynamics of vortex structures in pure electron and gas-discharge electron nonneutral plasmas during the time much more than the electron-neutral collision time has been carried out. The problem of long confinement of the column of pure electron plasma in Penning-Malmberg trap is considered. The mechanism of stability of long-lived vortex structure in gas-discharge nonneutral electron plasma is investigated. The collapse of electron sheath in gas-discharge nonneutral electron plasma in Penning cell at high pressures of neutral gas is described. The interaction between the stable vortex structure and the annular electron sheath, and the action of vortex structures on the transport of electrons along and across the magnetic field are discussed.","Laser light incident on targets at intensities such that the electron dynamics is ultrarelativistic gives rise to a harmonic power spectrum extending to high orders and characterized by a relatively slow decay with the harmonic number m that follows a power law dependence, m^{-p}. Relativistic similarity theory predicts a universal value for p = 8/3 up to some cut-off m = m*. The results presented in this work suggest that under conditions in which plasma effects contribute to the emission spectrum, the extent of this contribution may invalidate the concept of universal decay.

Cosmological Parameter Estimation Using the Genus Amplitude - Application to Mock Galaxy Catalogs,Power-spectrum simulations of radial redshift distributions,True,"We study the topology of the matter density field in two dimensional slices, and consider how we can use the amplitude $A$ of the genus for cosmological parameter estimation. Using the latest Horizon Run 4 simulation data, we calculate the genus of the smoothed density field constructed from lightcone mock galaxy catalogs. Information can be extracted from the amplitude of the genus by considering both its redshift evolution and magnitude. The constancy of the genus amplitude with redshift can be used as a standard population, from which we derive constraints on the equation of state of dark energy $w_{\rm de}$ - by measuring $A$ at $z \sim 0.1$ and $z \sim 1$, we can place an order $\Delta w_{\rm de} \sim {\cal O}(15\%)$ constraint on $w_{\rm de}$. By comparing $A$ to its Gaussian expectation value we can potentially derive an additional stringent constraint on the matter density $\Delta \Omega_{\rm mat} \sim 0.01$. We discuss the primary sources of contamination associated with the two measurements - redshift space distortion and shot noise. With accurate knowledge of galaxy bias, we can successfully remove the effect of redshift space distortion, and the combined effect of shot noise and non-linear gravitational evolution is suppressed by smoothing over suitably large scales $R_{\rm G} \ge 15 {\rm Mpc}/h$. Without knowledge of the bias, we discuss how joint measurements of the two and three dimensional genus can be used to constrain the growth factor $\beta = f/b$. The method can be applied optimally to redshift slices of a galaxy distribution generated using the drop-off technique.","On the base of the simplest model of a modulation of 3D Gaussian field in $k$-space we produce a set of simulations to bring out the effects of a modulating function $f_{\rm mod} (k)=f_1 (k) + f_2 (k)$ on power spectra of radial (shell-like) distributions of cosmological objects, where a model function $f_1 (k)$ reproduces the smoothed power spectrum of underlying 3D density fluctuations, while $f_2 (k)$ is a wiggling function imitating the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). It is shown that some excess of realizations of simulated radial distributions actually displays quasi-periodical components with periods about a characteristic scale $2\pi/k \sim 100~h^{-1}$~Mpc detected as power-spectrum peaks in vicinity of the first maximum of the modulation function $f_2 (k)$. We revised our previous estimations of the significance of such peaks and found that they were largely overestimated. Thereby quasi-periodical components appearing in some radial distributions of matter are likely to be stochastic (rather than determinative), while the amplitudes of the respective spectral peaks can be quite noticeable. They are partly enhanced by smooth part of the modulating function $f_1(k)$ and, to a far lesser extent, by effects of the BAO (i.e. $f_2(k)$). The results of the simulations match quite well with statistical properties of the radial distributions of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs).",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Annular billiard dynamics in a circularly polarized strong laser field,Effective unidirectional pumping for steady-state amplification without inversion,True,"We analyze the dynamics of a valence electron of the buckminsterfullerene molecule (C60) subjected to a circularly polarized laser field by modeling it with the motion of a classical particle in an annular billiard. We show that the phase space of the billiard model gives rise to three distinct trajectories: ""Whispering gallery orbits"", which only hit the outer billiard wall, ""daisy orbits"" which hit both billiard walls (while rotating solely clockwise or counterclockwise for all time), and orbits which only visit the downfield part of the billiard, as measured relative to the laser term. These trajectories, in general, maintain their distinct features, even as intensity is increased from 10^10 to 10^14 W*cm^-2. We attribute this robust separation of phase space to the existence of twistless tori.","We discuss an opportunity to achieve amplification without inversion in three-level cascade scheme using an effective unidirectional pumping via bidirectional incoherent pump.

Stealth Supersymmetry Simplified,Charmed baryon resonances with heavy-quark spin symmetry,True,"In Stealth Supersymmetry, bounds on superpartners from direct searches can be notably weaker than in standard supersymmetric scenarios, due to suppressed missing energy. We present a set of simplified models of Stealth Supersymmetry that motivate 13 TeV LHC searches. We focus on simplified models within the Natural Supersymmetry framework, in which the gluino, stop, and Higgsino are assumed to be lighter than other superpartners. Our simplified models exhibit novel decay patterns that differ significantly from topologies of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, with and without $R$-parity. We determine limits on stops and gluinos from searches at the 8 TeV LHC. Existing searches constitute a powerful probe of Stealth Supersymmetry gluinos with certain topologies. However, we identify simplified models where the gluino can be considerably lighter than 1 TeV.

Relativistic corrections for two- and three-body flux tube model,"Hadronic Higgs production through NLO+PS in the SM, the 2HDM and the MSSM",True,"We generalize the relativistic flux tube model for arbitrary two- or three-body systems. The spin-independent and spin-dependent contributions of the flux tube to the total Hamiltonian are computed in perturbation. In particular, we show that the spin-dependent part exhibits a universal spin-orbit form: It does not depend on the nature of the confined particles. The general equations we present, being well-defined for light particles, can thus be applied to usual as well as exotic hadrons such as hybrid mesons and glueballs.","The NLO cross section of the gluon fusion process is matched to parton showers in the MC@NLO approach. We work in the framework of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and document the inclusion of the full quark-mass dependence in the SM as well as the state-of-the-art squark and gluino effects within the MSSM embodied in the program SusHi. The combination of the two programs is realized by a script which is publicly available and whose usage is detailed. We discuss the input cards and the relevant parameter switches.

Inverse magneto-rotational catalysis and the phase diagram of a rotating hot and magnetized quark matter,"Tensor mesons, AdS/QCD and information",True,"We study the properties of a hot and magnetized quark matter in a rotating cylinder in the presence of a constant magnetic field. To do this, we solve the corresponding Dirac equation using the Ritus eigenfunction method. This leads to the energy dispersion relation, Ritus eigenfunctions, and the quantization relation for magnetized fermions. To avoid causality-violating effects, we impose a certain global boundary condition, and study its effect, in particular, on the energy eigenmodes and the quantization relations of fermions. Using the fermion propagator arising from this method, we then solve the gap equation at zero and nonzero temperatures. At zero temperature, the dynamical mass $\bar{m}$ does not depend on the angular frequency, as expected. We thus study its dependence on the distance $r$ relative to the axis of rotation and the magnetic field $B$, and explore the corresponding finite size effect for various couplings $G$. We then consider the finite temperature case. The dependence of $\bar{m}$ on the temperature $T$, magnetic field $B$, angular frequency $\Omega$, and distance $r$ for various $G$ is studied. We show that $\bar{m}$ decreases, in general, with $B$ and $\Omega$. This is the ''inverse magneto-rotational catalysis (IMRC)'' or the ''rotational magnetic inhibition'', previously discussed in the literature. To explore the evidence of this effect in the phase diagrams of our model, we examine the phase portraits of the critical temperature $T_c$ as well as the critical angular frequency $\Omega_c$ with respect to $G, B,\Omega$, and $r$ as well as $G, B, T$, and $r$, respectively. We show that $T_{c}$ and $\Omega_c$ decrease, in particular, with $B$. This is interpreted as clear evidence for IMRC.","The Kaluza-Klein tower of higher spin-$S$ tensor meson resonances is here scrutinized in the AdS/QCD hard wall model, encompassing the already established resonances $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$, $\omega_3(1670)$, $f_4(2050)$, $\rho_5(2350)$, $f_6(2510)$ in PDG. A hybrid model employs both information theory and AdS/QCD, where configurational-entropic Regge trajectories, relating the configurational entropy of the tensor mesons family to their $S$ spin, and also to their experimental mass spectra, are derived and analyzed.

Improved constraints on $\gamma$: CKM2014 update,Signal Processing in the MicroBooNE LArTPC,True,"I report on an updated combination of all currently available tree-level measurements of the CKM angle $\gamma$ from LHCb. This combination currently gives LHCb's most precise value of $\gamma = (73^{+9}_{-10})^\circ$ obtained from $B\to DK$-like decays. For the first time in a single experiment, the uncertainty has dropped below $10^\circ$. When using $B\to D\pi$ decays in addition, the situation becomes more difficult to interpret.","The MicroBooNE experiment is designed to observe interactions of neutrinos with a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector from the on-axis Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) and off-axis Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The detector consists of a $2.5~m\times 2.3~m\times 10.4~m$ TPC including an array of 32 PMTs used for triggering and timing purposes. The TPC is housed in an evacuable and foam insulated cryostat vessel. It has a 2.5 m drift length in a uniform field up to 500 V/cm. There are 3 readout wire planes (U, V and Y co-ordinates) with a 3-mm wire pitch for a total of 8,256 signal channels. The fiducial mass of the detector is 60 metric tons of LAr. In a LArTPC, ionization electrons from a charged particle track drift along the electric field lines to the detection wire planes inducing bipolar signals on the U and V (induction) planes, and a unipolar signal collected on the (collection) Y plane. The raw wire signals are processed by specialized low-noise front-end readout electronics immersed in LAr which shape and amplify the signal. Further signal processing and digitization is carried out by warm electronics. We present the techniques by which the observed final digitized waveforms, which comprise the original ionization signal convoluted with detector field response and electronics response as well as noise, are processed to recover the original ionization signal in charge and time. The correct modeling of these ingredients is critical for further event reconstruction in LArTPCs.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

The refractive index and wave vector in passive or active media,Toroidal dipole excitations in metamolecules formed by interacting plasmonic nanorods,True,"Materials that exhibit loss or gain have a complex valued refractive index $n$. Nevertheless, when considering the propagation of optical pulses, using a complex $n$ is generally inconvenient -- hence the standard choice of real-valued refractive index, i.e. $n_s = \RealPart (\sqrt{n^2})$. However, an analysis of pulse propagation based on the second order wave equation shows that use of $n_s$ results in a wave vector \emph{different} to that actually exhibited by the propagating pulse. In contrast, an alternative definition $n_c = \sqrt{\RealPart (n^2)}$, always correctly provides the wave vector of the pulse. Although for small loss the difference between the two is negligible, in other cases it is significant; it follows that phase and group velocities are also altered. This result has implications for the description of pulse propagation in near resonant situations, such as those typical of metamaterials with negative (or otherwise exotic) refractive indices.","We show how the elusive toroidal dipole moment appears as a radiative excitation eigenmode in a metamolecule resonator that is formed by pairs of plasmonic nanorods. We analyze one such nanorod configuration - a toroidal metamolecule. We find that the radiative interactions in the toroidal metamolecule can be qualitatively represented by a theoretical model based on an electric point dipole arrangement. Both a finite-size rod model and the point dipole approximation demonstrate how the toroidal dipole moment is subradiant and difficult to excite by incident light. By means of breaking the geometric symmetry of the metamolecule, the toroidal mode can be excited by linearly polarized light and appears as a Fano resonance dip in the forward scattered light. We provide simple optimization protocols for maximizing the toroidal dipole mode excitation. This opens up possibilities for simplified control and driving of metamaterial arrays consisting of toroidal dipole unit-cell resonators.",Optics,Optics in physics focuses on adaptive optics.

"Dressed vs. Pairwise States, and the Geometric Phase of Monopoles and Charges",Affinity of NJL$_2$ and NJL$_{4}$ model results on duality and pion condensation in chiral asymmetric dense quark matter,True,"We construct the Faddeev-Kulish dressed multiparticle states of electrically and magnetically charged particles, incorporating the effects of real and virtual soft photons. We calculate the properties of such dressed states under Lorentz transformations, and find that they can be identified with the pairwise multi-particle states that transform under the pairwise little group. The shifts in the dressing factors under Lorentz transformations are finite and have a simple geometric interpretation. Using the transformation properties of the dressed states we also present a novel, fully quantum field theoretic derivation of the geometric (Berry) phase obtained by an adiabatic rotation of the Dirac string, and also of the Dirac quantization condition. For half integer pairwise helcity, we show that these multiparticle states have flipped spin-statistics, reproducing the surprising fact that fermions can be made out of bosons.","In this paper we investigate the phase structure of a (1+1) and (3+1)-dimensional quark model with four-quark interaction and in the presence of baryon ($\mu_B$), isospin ($\mu_I$) and chiral isospin ($\mu_{I5}$) chemical potentials. It is shown that the chemical potential $\mu_{I5}$ promotes the appearance of the charged PC phase with nonzero baryon density. Results of both models are qualitatively the same, this fact enhances one's confidence in %the faith in the obtained predictions.

CP violation in $B^{\pm} \rightarrow \pi^{\pm}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ in the region with low invariant mass of one $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pair,A new determination of the charm mass from the non-analytic reconstruction of the heavy quark correlator,True,"Recently, the large CP asymmetries in $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm\pi^+\pi^-$ decays were found by the LHCb Collaboration to localize in the region $m_{\pi^+\pi^-}^2<0.4 \text{GeV}^2$. We find such large localized CP asymmetries may be due to the interference between a light scalar and $\rho^0(770)$ intermediate resonances. Consequently, we argue that the distribution of CP asymmetries in the Dalitz plots of three-body B decays could be very helpful for identifying the presence of the scalar resonance.","Using the new non-analytic reconstruction method obtained from Mellin-Barnes properties, one can extract the value $m_c(\bar{\text{MS}}) = 1.12 \pm 0.08 \;\; \text{GeV}$ from experimental data of the radiation-corrected measured hadronic cross section to the calculated lowest-order cross section for muon pair production in the heavy-quark approximation.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Proposal for a new quantum theory of gravity,The Bethe Ansatz for Z_S Orbifolds of N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory,True,"We recall a classical theory of torsion gravity with an asymmetric metric, sourced by a Nambu-Goto + Kalb-Ramond string . We explain why this is a significant gravitational theory, and in what sense classical general relativity is an approximation to it. We propose that a non-commutative generalisation of this theory (in the sense of Connes' non-commutative geometry and Adler's Trace Dynamics) is a `quantum theory of gravity'. The theory is in fact a classical matrix dynamics with only two fundamental constants -- the square of the Planck length and the speed of light, along with the two string tensions as parameters. The guiding symmetry principle is that the theory should be covariant under general coordinate transformations of non-commuting coordinates.The action for this non-commutative torsion gravity can be elegantly expressed as an invariant area integral, and represents an atom of space-time-matter. The statistical thermodynamics of a large number of such atoms yields the laws of quantum gravity and quantum field theory, at thermodynamic equilibrium. Spontaneous localisation caused by large fluctuations away from equilibrium is responsible for the emergence of classical space-time and the field equations of classical general relativity. The resolution of the quantum measurement problem by spontaneous collapse is an inevitable consequence of this process. Quantum theory and general relativity, are both seen as emergent phenomena, resulting from coarse-graining of the underlying non-commutative geometry. We explain the profound role played by entanglement in this theory: entanglement describes interaction between the atoms of space-time-matter, and indeed entanglement appears to be more fundamental than quantum theory or space-time. We also comment on possible implications for black hole entropy and evaporation, and for cosmology.","Worldsheet techniques can be used to argue for the integrability of string theory on AdS_5xS^5/Z_S, which is dual to the strongly coupled Z_S-orbifold of N=4 SYM.

The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS): Catalog of galaxy clusters and groups,"CLASH: Joint Analysis of Strong-Lensing, Weak-Lensing Shear and Magnification Data for 20 Galaxy Clusters",True,"The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey has been carried out during the PV phase of the SRG/eROSITA telescope and completed in November 2019. This survey is designed to provide the first eROSITA-selected sample of galaxy clusters and groups and to test the predictions for the all-sky survey in the context of cosmological studies with clusters. In the 140 deg$^2$ area covered by eFEDS, 542 candidate clusters and groups are detected as extended X-ray sources, down to a flux of $\sim10^{-14} $erg/s/cm$^2$ in the soft band (0.5-2 keV) within 1'. In this work, we provide the catalog of candidate galaxy clusters and groups in eFEDS. We perform imaging and spectral analysis on the eFEDS clusters with eROSITA X-ray data, and study the properties of the sample. The clusters are distributed in the redshift range [0.01, 1.3], with the median redshift at 0.35. We obtain the ICM temperature measurement with $>2\sigma$ c.l. for $\sim$1/5 (102/542) of the sample. The average temperature of these clusters is $\sim$2 keV. Radial profiles of flux, luminosity, electron density, and gas mass are measured from the precise modeling of the imaging data. The selection function, the purity and completeness of the catalog are examined and discussed in detail. The contamination fraction is $\sim1/5$ in this sample, dominated by misidentified point sources. The X-ray Luminosity Function of the clusters agrees well with the results obtained from other recent X-ray surveys. We also find 19 supercluster candidates in eFEDS, most of which are located at redshifts between 0.1 and 0.5. The eFEDS cluster and group catalog provides a benchmark proof-of-concept for the eROSITA All-Sky Survey extended source detection and characterization. We confirm the excellent performance of eROSITA for cluster science and expect no significant deviations from our pre-launch expectations for the final All-Sky Survey.","We present a comprehensive analysis of strong-lensing, weak-lensing shear and magnification data for a sample of 16 X-ray-regular and 4 high-magnification galaxy clusters selected from the CLASH survey. Our analysis combines constraints from 16-band HST observations and wide-field multi-color imaging taken primarily with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. We reconstruct surface mass density profiles of individual clusters from a joint analysis of the full lensing constraints, and determine masses and concentrations for all clusters. We find internal consistency of the ensemble mass calibration to be $\le 5\% \pm 6\%$ by comparison with the CLASH weak-lensing-only measurements of Umetsu et al. For the X-ray-selected subsample, we examine the concentration-mass relation and its intrinsic scatter using a Bayesian regression approach. Our model yields a mean concentration of $c|_{z=0.34} = 3.95 \pm 0.35$ at $M_{200c} \simeq 14\times 10^{14}M_\odot$ and an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma(\ln c_{200c}) = 0.13 \pm 0.06$, in excellent agreement with LCDM predictions when the CLASH selection function based on X-ray morphological regularity and the projection effects are taken into account. We also derive an ensemble-averaged surface mass density profile for the X-ray-selected subsample by stacking their individual profiles. The stacked mass profile is well described by a family of density profiles predicted for cuspy dark-matter-dominated halos, namely, the NFW, Einasto, and DARKexp models, whereas the single power-law, cored isothermal and Burkert density profiles are disfavored by the data. We show that cuspy halo models that include the two-halo term provide improved agreement with the data. For the NFW halo model, we measure a mean concentration of $c_{200c} = 3.79^{+0.30}_{-0.28}$ at $M_{200c} = 14.1^{+1.0}_{-1.0}\times 10^{14}M_\odot$, demonstrating consistency between complementary analysis methods.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Non-Equilibrium Quantum Dissipation,Optimal control of circuit quantum electrodynamics in one and two dimensions,True,"Dissipative processes in non-equilibrium many-body systems are fundamentally different than their equilibrium counterparts. Such processes are of great importance for the understanding of relaxation in single molecule devices. As a detailed case study, we investigate here a generic spin-fermion model, where a two-level system couples to two metallic leads with different chemical potentials. We present results for the spin relaxation rate in the nonadiabatic limit for an arbitrary coupling to the leads, using both analytical and exact numerical methods. The non-equilibrium dynamics is reflected by an exponential relaxation at long times and via complex phase shifts, leading in some cases to an ""anti-orthogonality"" effect. In the limit of strong system-lead coupling at zero temperature we demonstrate the onset of a Marcus-like Gaussian decay with {\it voltage difference} activation. This is analogous to the equilibrium spin-boson model, where at strong coupling and high temperatures the spin excitation rate manifests temperature activated Gaussian behavior. We find that there is no simple linear relationship between the role of the temperature in the bosonic system and a voltage drop in a non-equilibrium electronic case. The two models also differ by the orthogonality-catastrophe factor existing in a fermionic system, which modifies the resulting lineshapes. Implications for current characteristics are discussed. We demonstrate the violation of pair-wise Coulomb gas behavior for strong coupling to the leads. The results presented in this paper form the basis of an exact, non-perturbative description of steady-state quantum dissipative systems.","Optimal control can be used to significantly improve multi-qubit gates in quantum information processing hardware architectures based on superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics. We apply this approach not only to dispersive gates of two qubits inside a cavity, but, more generally, to architectures based on two-dimensional arrays of cavities and qubits. For high-fidelity gate operations, simultaneous evolutions of controls and couplings in the two coupling dimensions of cavity grids are shown to be significantly faster than conventional sequential implementations. Even under experimentally realistic conditions speedups by a factor of three can be gained. The methods immediately scale to large grids and indirect gates between arbitrary pairs of qubits on the grid.

The Dunhuang chinese sky: a comprehensive study of the oldest known star atlas,Solar System Physics for Exoplanet Research,True,"This paper presents an analysis of the star atlas included in the medieval Chinese manuscript (Or.8210/S.3326), discovered in 1907 by the archaeologist Aurel Stein at the Silk Road town of Dunhuang and now held in the British Library. Although partially studied by a few Chinese scholars, it has never been fully displayed and discussed in the Western world. This set of sky maps (12 hour angle maps in quasi-cylindrical projection and a circumpolar map in azimuthal projection), displaying the full sky visible from the Northern hemisphere, is up to now the oldest complete preserved star atlas from any civilisation. It is also the first known pictorial representation of the quasi-totality of the Chinese constellations. This paper describes the history of the physical object - a roll of thin paper drawn with ink. We analyse the stellar content of each map (1339 stars, 257 asterisms) and the texts associated with the maps. We establish the precision with which the maps are drawn (1.5 to 4 degrees for the brightest stars) and examine the type of projections used. We conclude that precise mathematical methods were used to produce the atlas. We also discuss the dating of the manuscript and its possible author and confirm the dates 649-684 (early Tang dynasty) as most probable based on available evidence. This is at variance with a prior estimate around +940. Finally we present a brief comparison with later sky maps, both in China and in Europe.","Over the past three decades, we have witnessed one of the great revolutions in our understanding of the cosmos - the dawn of the Exoplanet Era. Where once we knew of just one planetary system (the Solar system), we now know of thousands, with new systems being announced on a weekly basis. Of the thousands of planetary systems we have found to date, however, there is only one that we can study up-close and personal - the Solar system. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the Solar system for the exoplanetary science community - with a focus on the processes thought to have shaped the system we see today. In section one, we introduce the Solar system as a single well studied example of the many planetary systems now observed.

Constraining models with a large scalar multiplet,GUT inspired $SO(5) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ gauge-Higgs unification,True,"Models in which the Higgs sector is extended by a single electroweak scalar multiplet X can possess an accidental global U(1) symmetry at the renormalizable level if X has isospin T greater or equal to 2.

The effect of initial nuclear deformation on dielectron photoproduction in hadronic heavy-ion collisions,Rapid Thermalization by Baryon Injection in Gauge/Gravity Duality,True,"Significant excesses of $e^+e^-$ pair production at very low transverse momentum ($p_T <$ 0.15 GeV/c) were observed by the STAR collaboration in hadronic heavy-ion collisions. Such enhancement is assumed to be a sign of photon-photon production in heavy-ion collisions with hadronic overlap, based on comparisons with model calculations for spherical Au + Au collisions. However, there is a lack of calculations for $e^+e^-$ pair production from coherent photon-photon interactions in hadronic U + U collisions, due to the deformity of Uranium nuclei. In this article, we present calculations for $e^+e^-$ pair photoproduction at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV in both spherical and deformed U + U collisions within STAR detector acceptance using the equivalent photon approximation (EPA). We conduct event-by-event analysis to investigate the effects of initial nuclear deformation on pair production. Our numerical results show good agreement with experimental data for the 40%--60% and 60%--80% centrality classes in U + U collisions, and the differences between spherical and deformed configurations are approximately 3\%. We also calculate the yields of the photoproduced $e^+e^-$ pair in hadronic deformed Ru + Ru and Zr + Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The results reveal that the ratios of the yields of Ru to Zr exhibit very small differences ($<$ 1%) between spherical and deformed cases.","Using the AdS/CFT correspondence for strongly coupled gauge theories, we calculate thermalization of mesons caused by a time-dependent change of a baryon number chemical potential. On the gravity side, the thermalization corresponds to a horizon formation on the probe flavor brane in the AdS throat. Since heavy ion collisions are locally approximated by a sudden change of the baryon number chemical potential, we discuss implication of our results to RHIC and LHC experiments, to find a rough estimate of rather rapid thermalization time-scale t_{th} < 1 [fm/c].

How prominent are microemulsion phases in 2D electron systems?,Synthetic Topological Qubits in Conventional Bilayer Quantum Hall Systems,True,"In two-dimensional electronic systems, direct first-order phase transitions are prohibited as a consequence of the long-range Coulomb interaction, which implies a stiff energetic penalty for macroscopic phase separation. A prominent proposal is that any direct first-order transition is instead replaced by a sequence of ""microemulsion"" phases, in which the two phases are mixed in patterns of mesoscopic domains. In this note, we comment on the range $\Delta n$ of average electron density that such microemulsion phases may occupy. We point out that, even without knowing the value of a phenomenological parameter associated with surface tension between the two phases, one can place a fairly strong upper bound on the value of $\Delta n$. We make numerical estimates for $\Delta n$ in the case of the Fermi liquid to Wigner crystal transition and find $\Delta n$ to be on the order of $10^7$ cm$^{-2}$. This value is much smaller than the width of the phase transition observed in experiments, suggesting that disorder is a more likely explanation for the apparent broadening of the transition.","The idea of topological quantum computation is to build powerful and robust quantum computers with certain macroscopic quantum states of matter called topologically ordered states. These systems have degenerate ground states that can be used as robust ""topological qubits"" to store and process quantum information. However, a topological qubit has not been realized since the proposed systems either require sophisticated topologically ordered states that are not available yet, or require complicated geometries that are too difficult to realize. In this paper, we propose a new experimental setup which can realize topological qubits in a simple bilayer fractional quantum Hall (FQH) system with proper electric gate configurations. Compared to previous works, our proposal is accessible with current experimental techniques and only involves well-established topological states.

On Estimating the High-Energy Cutoff in the X-ray Spectra of Black Holes via Reflection Spectroscopy,Radio Variability in Seyfert Nuclei,True,"The fundamental parameters describing the coronal spectrum of an accreting black hole are the slope $\Gamma$ of the power-law continuum and the energy $E_{cut}$ at which it rolls over. Remarkably, this parameter can be accurately measured for values as high as 1 MeV by modeling the spectrum of X-rays reflected from a black hole accretion disk at energies below 100 keV. This is possible because the details in the reflection spectrum, rich in fluorescent lines and other atomic features, are very sensitive to the spectral shape of the hardest coronal radiation illuminating the disk. We show that fitting simultaneous NuSTAR (3-79 keV) and low-energy (e.g., Suzaku) data with the most recent version of our reflection model RELXILL, one can obtain reasonable constraints on $E_{cut}$ at energies from tens of keV up to 1 MeV, for a source as faint as 1 mCrab in a 100 ks observation.","Comparison of 8.4-GHz radio images of a sample of 11 early-type Seyfert galaxies with previous observations reveals possible variation in the nuclear radio flux density in 5 of them over a 7-yr period. We find no correlation between radio variability and nuclear radio luminosity or Seyfert nuclear type, although the sample is small and dominated by type 2 Seyferts. Instead, a possible correlation between the presence of nuclear radio variability and the absence of ~100-pc-scale radio emission is seen. NGC2110 is the only source with significant extended radio structure and strong nuclear variability (>38% nuclear decline over seven years). Our results suggest that all Seyferts may exhibit variation in their nuclear radio flux density at 8.4 GHz, but that variability is more easily recognised in compact sources in which emission from the variable nucleus is not diluted by unresolved, constant flux density radio-jet emission within the central ~50 pc. If flares in radio light curves correspond to ejection of new relativistic components or emergence of shocks in the underlying flow, we suggest that radio jets may be intrinsically non-relativistic during quiescence, but that Seyferts, as black-hole driven AGN, have the capacity to accelerate relativistic jets during radio flares. Taken together with the increased detection rate of flat spectrum radio nuclei in Seyferts imaged at VLBI resolutions and the detection of variable water megamaser emission, our results support the paradigm of intermittent periods of quiescence and nuclear outburst across the Seyfert population.

Adiabatic waveforms for extreme mass-ratio inspirals via multivoice decomposition in time and frequency,A Hard X-Ray Power-Law Spectral Cutoff in Centaurus X-4,True,"We compute adiabatic waveforms for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) by ""stitching"" together a long inspiral waveform from a sequence of waveform snapshots, each of which corresponds to a particular geodesic orbit. We show that the complicated total waveform can be regarded as a sum of ""voices."" Each voice evolves in a simple way on long timescales, a property which can be exploited to efficiently produce waveform models that faithfully encode the properties of EMRI systems. We look at examples for a range of different orbital geometries: spherical orbits, equatorial eccentric orbits, and one example of generic (inclined and eccentric) orbits. To our knowledge, this is the first calculation of a generic EMRI waveform that uses strong-field radiation reaction. We examine waveforms in both the time and frequency domains. Although EMRIs evolve slowly enough that the stationary phase approximation (SPA) to the Fourier transform is valid, the SPA calculation must be done to higher order for some voices, since their instantaneous frequency can change from chirping forward ($\dot f > 0$) to chirping backward ($\dot f < 0$). The approach we develop can eventually be extended to more complete EMRI waveform models, for example to include effects neglected by the adiabatic approximation such as the conservative self force and spin-curvature coupling.","The low-mass X-ray binary Cen X-4 is the brightest and closest (<1.2 kpc) quiescent neutron star transient. Previous 0.5-10 keV X-ray observations of Cen X-4 in quiescence identified two spectral components: soft thermal emission from the neutron star atmosphere and a hard power-law tail of unknown origin. We report here on a simultaneous observation of Cen X-4 with NuSTAR (3-79 keV) and XMM-Newton (0.3-10 keV) in 2013 January, providing the first sensitive hard X-ray spectrum of a quiescent neutron star transient. The 0.3-79 keV luminosity was 1.1 x 10^(33) erg/s (for D=1kpc), with around 60 percent in the thermal component. We clearly detect a cutoff of the hard spectral tail above 10 keV, the first time such a feature has been detected in this source class. We show that thermal Comptonization and synchrotron shock origins for the hard X-ray emission are ruled out on physical grounds. However, the hard X-ray spectrum is well fit by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with an 18 keV electron temperature, which can be understood as arising either in a hot layer above the neutron star atmosphere or in a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). The power-law cutoff energy may be set by the degree of Compton cooling of the bremsstrahlung electrons by thermal seed photons from the neutron star surface. Lower thermal luminosities should lead to higher (possibly undetectable) cutoff energies. We compare Cen~X-4's behavior with PSR J1023+0038, IGR J18245-2452, and XSS J12270-4859, which have shown transitions between LMXB and radio pulsar modes at a similar X-ray luminosity.",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"High energy astrophysical phenomena focuses on cosmic ray production, acceleration, propagation, detection.

Bose-Einstein condensation in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory,CONNECTIONS of the LIOUVILLE MODEL and XXZ SPIN CHAIN,True,"In this paper we study the corrections emergent from a Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz extension of the complex scalar sector to the Bose-Einstein condensation and to the thermodynamics parameters. We initially discussed some features of the model to only then compute the corrections to the Bose-Einstein condensation. The calculations were done by computing the generating functional, from which we extract the thermodynamics parameters. We also obtained the Lifshitz scaling correction for the critical temperature $T_c$ that sets the Bose-Einstein Condensation.","The quantum theory of the Liouville model with imaginary field is considered using the quantum inverse scattering method. An integrable structure with nontrivial spectral parameter dependence is developed for lattice Liouville theory by scaling the $L$-matrix of lattice sine-Gordon theory. This $L$-matrix yields Bethe Ansatz equations for Liouville theory, by the methods of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. Using the string picture of exited Bethe states, the lattice Liouville Bethe equations are mapped to the corresponding equations for the spin 1/2 XXZ chain. The well developed theory of finite size corrections in spin chains is used to deduce the conformal properties of the lattice Liouville Bethe states. The unitary series of conformal field theories emerge for Liouville couplings of the form $\gam = \pi\frac{\nu}{\nu+1}$, corresponding to root of unity XXZ anisotropies. The Bethe states give the full spectrum of the corresponding unitary conformal field theory, with the primary states in the \Kac table parameterized by a string length $K$, and the remnant of the chain length mod $(\nu+1)$.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

"Glauber-model analysis of total reaction cross sections for Ne, Mg, Si, and S isotopes with Skyrme-Hartree-Fock densities",Collective longitudinal polarization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at very high energy,True,"A systematic analysis is made on the total reaction cross sections for Ne, Mg, Si, and S isotopes. The high-energy nucleus-nucleus collision is described based on the Glauber model. Using the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method in the three-dimensional grid-space representation, we determine the nuclear density distribution for a wide range of nuclei self-consistently without assuming any spatial symmetry. The calculated total reaction cross sections consistently agree with the recent cross section data on Ne$+^{12}$C collision at 240$A$\,MeV, which makes it possible to discuss the radius and deformation of the isotopes. The total reaction cross sections for Mg$+^{12}$C, Si$+^{12}$C and S$+^{12}$C cases are predicted for future measurements. We also find that the high-energy cross section data for O, Ne, and Mg isotopes on a $^{12}$C target at around 1000\,$A$MeV can not be reproduced consistently with the corresponding data at 240\,$A$MeV.","We study the polarization of particles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at very high energy along the beam direction within a relativistic hydrodynamic framework. We show that this component of the polarization decreases much slower with center-of-mass energy compared to the transverse component, even in the ideal longitudinal boost-invariant scenario with non-fluctuating initial state, and that it can be measured by taking advantage of its quadrupole structure in the transverse momentum plane. In the ideal longitudinal boost-invariant scenario, the polarization is proportional to the gradient of temperature at the hadronization and its measurement can provide important information about the cooling rate of the Quark Gluon Plasma around the critical temperature.",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

Investigations of Azimuthal Asymmetry in Semi-Inclusive Leptoproduction,Associated top quark pair production with a heavy boson: differential cross sections at NLO+NNLL accuracy,True,"We consider the azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic leptoproduction arising due to both perturbative and nonperturbative effects at HERMES energies and show that the $k_T^2/Q^2$ order corrections to $< \cos\phi >$ and $< \cos2\phi >$ are significant. We also reconsider the results of perturbative effects for $< \cos\phi >$ at large momentum transfers \cite{A1} using the more recent sets of scale-dependent distribution and fragmentation functions, which bring up to $18{%}$ difference in $< \cos\phi >$. In the same approach we calculate the $< \cos2\phi >$ as well.","We present theoretical predictions for selected differential cross sections for the process $pp \to t \bar{t} B$ at the LHC, where $B$ can be a Higgs ($H$), a $Z$ or a $W$ boson.

Neutral carbon and highly excited CO in a massive star-forming main sequence galaxy at z=2.2,Formation of complex organic molecules in hot molecular cores through nondiffusive grain-surface and ice-mantle chemistry,True,"We used the Plateau De Bure Interferometer to observe multiple CO and neutral carbon transitions in a z=2.2 main sequence disk galaxy, BX610. Our observation of CO(7-6), CO(4-3), and both far-infrared(FIR) [CI] lines complements previous observations of H$\alpha$ and low-J CO, and reveals a galaxy that is vigorously forming stars with UV fields (Log($G$ G$_0^{-1}) \lesssim3.25);$ although less vigorously than local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies or most starbursting submillimeter galaxies in the early universe. Our observations allow new independent estimates of the cold gas mass which indicate $M_\textrm{gas}\sim2\times10^{11}$M$_\odot$, and suggest a modestly larger $\alpha_{\textrm{CO}}$ value of $\sim$8.2. The corresponding gas depletion timescale is $\sim$1.5 Gyr. In addition to gas of modest density (Log($n$ cm$^3)\lesssim3$ ) heated by star formation, BX610 shows evidence for a significant second gas component responsible for the strong high-J CO emission. This second component might either be a high-density molecular gas component heated by star formation in a typical photodissociation region, or could be molecular gas excited by low-velocity C shocks. The CO(7-6)-to-FIR luminosity ratio we observe is significantly higher than typical star-forming galaxies and suggests that CO(7-6) is not a reliable star-formation tracer in this galaxy.","A new, more comprehensive model of gas-grain chemistry in hot molecular cores is presented, in which nondiffusive reaction processes on dust-grain surfaces and in ice mantles are implemented alongside traditional diffusive surface/bulk-ice chemistry. We build on our nondiffusive treatments used for chemistry in cold sources, adopting a standard collapse/warm-up physical model for hot cores. A number of other new chemical model inputs and treatments are also explored in depth, culminating in a final model that demonstrates excellent agreement with gas-phase observational abundances for many molecules, including some (e.g. methoxymethanol) that could not be reproduced by conventional diffusive mechanisms. Observed ratios of structural isomers methyl formate, glycolaldehyde and acetic acid are well reproduced by the models. The main temperature regimes are identified in which various complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed. Nondiffusive chemistry advances the production of many COMs to much earlier times and lower temperatures than in previous model implementations. Those species may form either as by-products of simple-ice production, or via early photochemistry within the ices while external UV photons can still penetrate. Cosmic ray-induced photochemistry is less important than in past models, although it affects some species strongly over long timescales. Another production regime occurs during the high-temperature desorption of solid water, whereby radicals trapped in the ice are released onto the grain/ice surface, where they rapidly react. Several recently-proposed gas-phase COM-production mechanisms are also introduced, but they rarely dominate. New surface/ice reactions involving CH and CH$_2$ are found to contribute substantially to the formation of certain COMs.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Band structure asymmetry of bilayer graphene revealed by infrared spectroscopy,Tuning of heat and charge transport by Majorana fermions,True,"We report on infrared spectroscopy of bilayer graphene integrated in gated structures. We observed a significant asymmetry in the optical conductivity upon electrostatic doping of electrons and holes. We show that this finding arises from a marked asymmetry between the valence and conduction bands, which is mainly due to the inequivalence of the two sublattices within the graphene layer. From the conductivity data, the energy difference of the two sublattices is determined.","We investigate theoretically thermal and electrical conductances for the system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) connected both to a pair of Majorana fermions residing the edges of a Kitaev wire and two metallic leads. We demonstrate that both quantities reveal pronounced resonances, whose positions can be controlled by tuning of an asymmetry of the couplings of the QD and a pair of MFs.

Protocol dependence of the jamming transition,Anomalous mobility of a driven active particle in a steady laminar flow,True,"We propose a theoretical framework for predicting the protocol dependence of the jamming transition for frictionless spherical particles that interact via purely repulsive contact forces. We study isostatic jammed disk packings obtained via two protocols: isotropic compression and simple shear. We show that for frictionless systems, all jammed packings can be obtained via either protocol. However, the probability to obtain a particular jammed packing depends on the packing-generation protocol. We predict the average shear strain required to induce jamming in initially unjammed packings from the measured probability to jam at packing fraction $\phi$ from isotropic compression. We compare our predictions to results from numerical simulations of jamming and find quantitative agreement. We also show that the packing fraction range, over which strain-induced jamming occurs, tends to zero in the large system limit for frictionless packings with overdamped dynamics.","We study, via extensive numerical simulations, the force-velocity curve of an active particle advected by a steady laminar flow, in the nonlinear response regime. Our model for an active particle relies on a colored noise term that mimics its persistent motion over a time scale $\tau_A$. We find that the active particle dynamics shows non-trivial effects, such as negative differential and absolute mobility (NDM and ANM, respectively). We explore the space of the model parameters and compare the observed behaviors with those obtained for a passive particle ($\tau_A=0$) advected by the same laminar flow. Our results show that the phenomena of NDM and ANM are quite robust with respect to the details of the considered noise: in particular for finite $\tau_A$ a more complex force-velocity relation can be observed.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Low-energy three-body dynamics in binary quantum gases,Few interacting fermions in one-dimensional harmonic trap,True,"The universal three-body dynamics in ultra-cold binary Fermi and Fermi-Bose mixtures is studied. Two identical fermions of the mass $m$ and a particle of the mass $m_1$ with the zero-range two-body interaction in the states of the total angular momentum L=1 are considered. Using the boundary condition model for the s-wave interaction of different particles, both eigenvalue and scattering problems are treated by solving hyper-radial equations, whose terms are derived analytically. The dependencies of the three-body binding energies on the mass ratio $m/m_1$ for the positive two-body scattering length are calculated; it is shown that the ground and excited states arise at $m/m_1 \ge \lambda_1 \approx 8.17260$ and $m/m_1 \ge \lambda_2 \approx 12.91743$, respectively. For $m/m_1 \alt \lambda_1$ and $m/m_1 \alt \lambda_2$, the relevant bound states turn to narrow resonances, whose positions and widths are calculated. The 2 + 1 elastic scattering and the three-body recombination near the three-body threshold are studied and it is shown that a two-hump structure in the mass-ratio dependencies of the cross sections is connected with arising of the bound states.","We study spin-1/2 fermions, interacting via a two-body contact potential, in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. Applying exact diagonalization, we investigate their behavior at finite interaction strength, and discuss the role of the ground-state degeneracy which occurs for sufficiently strong repulsive interaction.

Turning drops into bubbles: Elastic cavitation by diffusion,"Physics of drying complex fluid drop: flow field, pattern formation, and desiccation cracks",True,"Some members of the vegetal kingdom can achieve surprisingly fast movements making use of a clever combination of evaporation, elasticity and cavitation. In this process, enthalpic energy is transformed into elastic energy and suddenly released in a cavitation event which produces kinetic energy. Here we study this uncommon energy transformation by a model system: a droplet in an elastic medium shrinks slowly by diffusion and eventually transforms into a bubble by a rapid cavitation event. The experiments reveal the cavity dynamics over the extremely disparate timescales of the process, spanning 9 orders of magnitude. We model the initial shrinkage as a classical diffusive process, while the sudden bubble growth and oscillations are described using an inertial-(visco)elastic model, in excellent agreement with the experiments. Such a model system could serve as a new paradigm for motile synthetic materials.","Drying complex fluids is a common phenomenon where a liquid phase transforms into a dense or porous solid. This transformation involves several physical processes, such as the diffusion of liquid molecules into the surrounding atmosphere and the movement of dispersed phases through evaporation-driven flow. As a result, the solute forming a dried deposit exhibits unique patterns and often displays structural defects like desiccation cracks, buckling, or wrinkling. Various drying configurations have been utilized to study the drying of colloids, the process of their consolidation, and fluid-flow dynamics. This review focuses on the drying of colloids and the related phenomena, specifically the drying-induced effects observed during sessile drop drying. We first present a theoretical overview of the physics of drying pure and binary liquid droplets, followed by drying colloidal droplets.

Fluid ferroelectric filaments,Comparison of splashing in high and low viscosity liquids,True,"Freestanding slender fluid filaments of room temperature ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals are described. They are stabilized either by internal electric fields of bound charges formed due to polarization splay, or by external voltage applied between suspending wires. The phenomenon is similar to those observed in dielectric fluids, such as deionized water, except that in ferroelectric nematic materials the voltages required are 3 orders of magnitudes smaller and the aspect ratio is much higher. The observed ferroelectric fluid threads are not only unique and novel, but also offer measurements of basic physical quantities, such as the ferroelectric polarization and viscosity. Ferroelectric nematic fluid threads may have practical applications in nano-fluidic micron-size logic devices, switches, and relays.","We explore the evolution of a splash when a liquid drop impacts a smooth, dry surface. There are two splashing regimes that occur when the liquid viscosity is varied, as is evidenced by its dependence on ambient gas pressure. A high-viscosity drop splashes by emitting a thin sheet of liquid from a spreading liquid lamella long after the drop has first contacted the solid. Likewise, we find that there is also a delay in the ejection of a thin sheet when a low-viscosity drop splashes. We show how the ejection time of the thin sheet depends on liquid viscosity and ambient gas pressure.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Superconductivity by Kinetic Energy Saving?,Majorana zero modes in a quantum wire platform without Rashba spin-orbit coupling,True,"A brief introduction is given in the generic microscopic framework of superconductivity. The consequences for the temperature dependence of the kinetic energy, and the correlation energy are discussed for two cases: The BCS scenario and the non-Fermi liquid scenario. A quantitative comparison is made between the BCS-prediction for d-wave pairing in a band with nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor hoppping and the experimental specific heat and the optical intraband spectral weight along the plane. We show that the BCS-prediction produces the wrong sign for the kink at Tc of the intraband spectral weight, even though the model calculation agrees well with the specific heat.","We propose a platform for engineering helical fermions in a hybridized double-quantum-wire setup.

Problems with the oversimplified string description of the Wilson flux sheet are discussed.,"In the large-$N$ and strong-coupling limit, maximally supersymmetric SU($N$) Yang--Mills theory in $(2 + 1)$ dimensions is conjectured to be dual to the decoupling limit of a stack of $N$ D$2$-branes, which may be described by IIA supergravity.We study this conjecture in the Euclidean setting using nonperturbative lattice gauge theory calculations.Our supersymmetric lattice construction naturally puts the theory on a skewed Euclidean 3-torus. Taking one cycle to have anti-periodic fermion boundary conditions, the large-torus limit is described by certain Euclidean black holes. We compute the bosonic action---the variation of the partition function---and compare our numerical results to the supergravity prediction as the size of the torus is changed, keeping its shape fixed.

Accuracy of effective mass equation for a single and double cylindrical quantum dot,Helical liquids and Majorana bound states in quantum wires,True,"In this contribution we study the accuracy of various forms of electron effective mass equation in reproducing spectral and spin-related features of quantum dot systems. We compare the results of the standard 8 band k.p model to those obtained from effective mass equations obtained by perturbative elimination procedures in various approximations for a cylindrical quantum dot or a system of two such dots. We calculate the splitting of electronic shells, the electron g-factor and spin-orbit induced spin mixing and show that for a cylindrical dot the g-factor is reproduced very exactly, while for the two other quantities the effective mass equation is much less accurate.","We show that the combination of spin-orbit coupling with a Zeeman field or strong interactions may lead to the formation of a helical liquid in single-channel quantum wires. In a helical liquid, electrons with opposite velocities have opposite spin precession.

Heterogeneous Dynamics in Columnar Liquid Crystals of Parallel Hard Rods,"""Cooling by heating"" - demonstrating the significance of the longitudinal specific heat",True,"In the wake of previous studies on the rattling-and-jumping diffusion in smectic liquid crystal phases of colloidal rods, we analyze here for the first time the heterogeneous dynamics in columnar phases. More specifically, we perform computer simulations to investigate the relaxation dynamics of a binary mixture of perfectly aligned hard spherocylinders. We detect that the columnar arrangement of the system produces free-energy barriers the particles should overcome to jump from one column to another, thus determining a hopping-type diffusion. This phenomenon accounts for the non-Gaussian inter-column diffusion and shows a two-step structural relaxation which is remarkably analogous to that of out-of-equilibrium glass-forming systems and gels. Surprisingly enough, slight deviations from the behavior of simple liquids due to transient cages is also observed in the direction perpendicular to this plane, where the system is usually referred to as liquid-like.","Heating a solid sphere at the surface induces mechanical stresses inside the sphere. If a finite amount of heat is supplied, the stresses gradually disappear as temperature becomes homogeneous throughout the sphere. We show that before this happens, there is a temporary lowering of pressure and density in the interior of the sphere, inducing a transient lowering of the temperature here. For ordinary solids this effect is small because c_p is almost equal to c_V. For fluent liquids the effect is negligible because their dynamic shear modulus vanishes. For a liquid at its glass transition, however, the effect is generally considerably larger than in solids. This paper presents analytical solutions of the relevant coupled thermoviscoelastic equations. In general, there is a difference between the isobaric specific heat, c_p, measured at constant isotropic pressure and the longitudinal specific heat, c_l, pertaining to mechanical boundary conditions that confine the associated expansion to be longitudinal. In the exact treatment of heat propagation the heat diffusion constant contains c_l rather than c_p. We show that the key parameter controlling the magnitude of the ""cooling-by-heating"" effect is the relative difference between these two specific heats. For a typical glass-forming liquid, when temperature at the surface is increased by 1 K, a lowering of the temperature in the sphere center of order 5 mK is expected if the experiment is performed at the glass transition. The cooling-by-heating effect is confirmed by measurements on a 19 mm diameter glucose sphere at the glass transition.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Testing heavy neutral leptons produced in the supernovae explosions with future neutrino detectors,Evidence of non-luminous matter in the center of M62,True,"Hypothetical particles called heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) can be produced in large quantities in the cores of supernovae during the first seconds of the explosion. These particles then decay, producing secondary energetic neutrinos that can be detected by neutrino detectors. In this paper, I identify a region of the HNL parameter space that could be tested using this method, assuming a supernova explosion at distances from 0.2 to 10 kpc. The range of HNLs masses $m_N \sim 160-700$ MeV and lifetimes of $\tau_N \gtrsim 0.02$ seconds can be probed using the Hyper-Kamiokande neutrino detector. This region of the parameter space is complementary to existing bounds from primordial nucleosynthesis and to the expected sensitivity of the future SHiP experiment, thus covering a gap in our current knowledge of HNLs up to masses of $m_N \simeq 400$ MeV.","Theoretical models suggest that intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) may form and reside in the centers of globular clusters. IMBHs are still elusive to observations, but the accelerations of pulsars may bring along a unique fingerprint of their presence. In this work, we focus on the pulsars in the globular cluster M62. Using the new distance of M62 obtained from Gaia observations, we find that the measured pulsars' accelerations suggest a central excess of mass in the range [1200, 6000]$M_{\odot}$, corresponding to [0.2, 1] percent of the current total mass of the cluster.

Properties of DBD Plasma Jets using Powered Electrode With and Without Contact with the Plasma,Topological approach for laser acceleration investigation,True,"An experimental investigation comparing the properties of plasma jets in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) configurations using a powered electrode with and without a dielectric barrier, while keeping a second dielectric barrier over the grounded electrode, is reported in this work. For this purpose, two different power sources were used to produce the plasma jets, with one of them producing a pulsed high-voltage (HV) output and the other one producing a pulse-like HV output, which consists of a damped sine HV waveform. Measurements of plasma parameters were performed for both configurations using argon and helium as working gases. As a result, if the pulsed power source is used, significant differences were found in discharge power ($P_{plasma}$), rotational and vibrational temperatures ($T_r$ and $T_v$, respectively) when switching from one configuration to the other. On the other hand, using the pulse-like HV only the $P_{plasma}$ parameter presented significant differences when switching the electrode's configuration. For the pulsed source it has been observed that despite the remarkable increase in $P_{plasma}$ when changing from the double barrier configuration to the single barrier one, the values obtained for $T_r$ and $T_v$ also increased, but not in the same proportion as the increase in $P_{plasma}$, which suggests a non-linear dependency between temperatures and discharge power in the plasma jet. As an example for application of plasmas in both configurations, tests in an attempt to remove copper films deposited on alumina substrates were performed and, as a result, there was significant material removal only when the powered electrode was in contact with the plasma. As a general conclusion, if higher power is really required for some application it is better to use this configuration.","An approach using topology reveals a new understanding and knowledge of laser particle acceleration. Laser pulse irradiation on a thin-foil target is examined using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Through topology, laser ion acceleration schemes are classified depending on whether the deformed target shape after laser irradiation is homeomorphic with respect to the initial target. High energy ions are generated with high-efficiency when the deformed target shape is non-homeomorphic. In this case, the target thickness greatly affects the obtained ion energy. However, when the deformed target shape is homeomorphic, the obtained ion energy is low, and the effect of the target thickness is small.",Plasma Physics,"Plasma physics focuses on fundamental plasma physics.

Investigating saturation effects in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC with the color dipole model,Alpha-induced reactions for the astrophysical p-process: the case of 151Eu,True,"We investigate saturation effects in $ep$ scattering as well as in ultraperipheral $p$A and AA collisions at small $x$ with four variants of the impact parameter dependent color dipole model: with and without gluon saturation and with and without a novel mechanism that suppresses unphysical dipole radii above the confinement scale, a problem not addressed by most implementations. We show that $ep$ scattering at HERA can be very well described by any of the four variants. When going from $ep$ to $e$A scattering, saturation effects are expected to increase as $\sim$A$^{1/3}$. In lieu of an electron-ion collider, we confront the different versions of the dipole model with data recorded in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC in order to estimate the sensitivity of the data to gluon saturation in the target nuclei. We find that ultraperipheral PbPb collisions indicate strong saturation effects while $p$Pb collisions turn out to not have any discriminating power to distinguish saturation from non-saturation scenarios.","The cross sections of 151Eu(alpha,gamma)155Tb and 151Eu(alpha,n)154Tb reactions have been measured with the activation method.

Yang-Mills glueball masses from spectral reconstruction,\chi_{cJ} polarizations at the Fermilab Tevatron,True,"We compute masses of the two lightest glueballs from spectral reconstructions of timelike interaction channels of the four-gluon vertex in Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory. The Euclidean spacelike dressings of the vertex are calculated with the functional renormalisation group. For the spectral reconstruction of these Euclidean data, we employ Gaussian process regression. The glueball resonances can be identified straightforwardly and we obtain $m_{sc} = 1870(75)~$ MeV as well as $m_{ps} = 2700(120)~$ MeV, in accordance with functional bound state and lattice calculations.","We propose the measurement of $\chi_{cJ}$ polarizations at high energy hadron colliders to study heavy quarkonium production mechanism. We find that the color-singlet model in the $k_t$ factorization approach predicts very different behavior for $\chi_{cJ}$ polarizations at the Fermilab Tevatron compared with the NRQCD predictions in the collinear parton model. In the color-singlet $k_t$ factorization approach, for both $\chi_{c1}$ and $\chi_{c2}$ productions, the helicity $h=0$ states dominate over other helicity states at large $p_T$. These properties are very useful in distinguishing between the two production mechanisms which are related to the interesting issue of $J\psi$ and $\psi'$ polarizations, and may provide a crucial test for the $k_t$ factorization approach.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Strong Cosmic Censorship in Charged de Sitter spacetime with Scalar Field Non-minimally Coupled to Curvature,Hawking radiation in the kappa-spacetime,True,"We examine the stability and the strong cosmic censorship in the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter (RN-dS) black hole by investigating the evolution of a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the curvature. We find that when the coupling parameter is negative, the RN-dS black hole experiences instability. The instability disappears when the coupling parameter becomes non-negative. With the increase of the coupling parameter, the violation of the strong cosmic censorship occurs at a larger critical charge ratio. But such an increase of the critical charge is suppressed by the increase of the cosmological constant. Different from the minimal coupling situation, it is possible to accommodate $\beta\ge1$ in the near extremal black hole when the scalar field is non-minimally coupled to curvature. The increase of the cosmological constant can allow $\beta\ge1$ to be satisfied for even smaller value of the coupling parameter. The existence of $\beta\ge1$ implies that the resulting curvature can continuously cross the Cauchy horizon.","In this paper, we analyze the Hawking radiation of a kappa-deformed Schwarzchild black hole and obtain the deformed Hawking temperature. For this, we first derive deformed metric for the kappa-spacetime, which in the generic case, is not a symmetric tensor and also has a momentum dependence. We show that the Schwarzchild metric obtained in the kappa-deformed spacetime has a dependence on energy. We use the fact that the deformed metric is conformally flat in the 1+1 dimensions, to solve the kappa-deformed Klein-Gordon equation in the background of the Schwarzchild metric. The method of Boguliobov coefficients is then used to calculate the thermal spectrum of kappa-deformed-Schwarzchild black hole and show that the Hawking temperature is modified by the non-commutativity of the kappa-spacetime.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Variance-Based Sensitivity Analysis of $\Lambda$-type Quantum Memory,Polarization-Selective Control of Nonlinear Optomechanical Interactions in Subwavelength Elliptical Waveguides,True,"The storage and retrieval of photonic quantum states, quantum memory, is a key resource for a wide range of quantum applications. Here we investigate the sensitivity of $\Lambda$-type quantum memory to experimental fluctuations and drift. We use a variance-based approach, focusing on the effects of fluctuations and drift on memory efficiency. We consider shot-to-shot fluctuations of the memory parameters, and separately we consider longer timescale drift of the control field parameters. We find the parameters that a quantum memory is most sensitive to depend on the quantum memory protocol being employed, where the observed sensitivity agrees with physical interpretation of the protocols. We also present a general framework that is applicable to other figures of merit beyond memory efficiency. These results have practical ramifications for quantum memory experiments.","Photonic devices exhibiting all-optically reconfigurable polarization dependence with a large dynamic range would be highly attractive for active polarization control. Here, we report that strongly polarization-selective nonlinear optomechanical interactions emerge in subwavelength waveguides. By using full-vectorial finite element analysis, we find that at certain core ellipticities (aspect ratios) the forward simulated light scattering mediated by a specific acoustic mode is eliminated for one polarization mode, whereas that for the other polarization mode is rather enhanced. This intriguing phenomenon can be explained by the interplay between the electrostrictive force and radiation pressure and turns out to be tailorable by choice of waveguide materials.",Optics,Optics in physics focuses on adaptive optics.

"Beyond boundaries of redshift surveys: assessing mass fluctuations on ""super-survey"" scales",Generation of Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves from Dilaton-Gauge Field Dynamics,True,"The observed density field in redshift space is directly affected by the radial motions generated from mass fluctuations outside the volume occupied by a given galaxy redshift survey. These motions introduce redshift space anisotropies which are more pronounced at larger distances from the survey's center, thus offering clues to the nature of mass fluctuations on super-survey scales. Furthermore, we note that all estimates of the growth factor derived from redshift space distortions are based on relations which explicitly assume that the velocity field is generated by mass fluctuations inside the survey volume. This may cause uncertainties in these estimates which are on the order of a few percent.","We study the observational signatures from particle production of a $U(1)$ gauge field kinetically coupled to an inflaton. Regarding the form of gauge kinetic function, we consider the possibility that it becomes stabilized at a certain time, which makes the growing power of the gauge field evolve non-monotonically with a sharp transition. Remarkably, the copious production of the gauge field occurs on super-horizon scales at the late stage of inflation and perturbations are enhanced on the intermediate scales during inflation. We find that it can predict a bumpy shape of the curvature power spectrum which leads to the generation of primordial black holes as a dark matter after inflation. We also estimate two types of tensor modes sourced by the gauge field: the primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation and the induced gravitational waves provided by the enhanced curvature perturbation after inflation.

Phase coherent transport in bilayer and trilayer MoS2,Dicke Superradiance in a magnetoplasma,True,"Bilayer MoS2 is a centrosymmetric semiconductor with degenerate spin states in the six valleys at the corners of the Brillouin zone. It has been proposed that breaking of this inversion symmetry by an out-of-plane electric field breaks this degeneracy, allowing for spin and valley lifetimes to be manipulated electrically in bilayer MoS2 with an electric field. In this work, we report phase-coherent transport properties of double-gated mono-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS2. We observe a similar crossover from weak localization to weak anti-localization, from which we extract the spin relaxation time as a function of both electric field and temperature. We find that the spin relaxation time is inversely proportional to momentum relaxation time, indicating that D'yakonov-Perel mechanism is dominant in all devices despite its centrosymmetry. Further, we found no evidence of electric-field induced changes in spin-orbit coupling strength. This suggests that the interlayer coupling is sufficiently weak and that electron-doped dichalcogenide multilayers behave electrically as decoupled monolayers.","We present theoretical results for superradiance, i.e. the collective coherent decay of a radiating system, in a semiconductor heterostructure under a strong quantizing magnetic field. We predict a strong peak (`Dicke-peak') in the emission intensity as a function of time, which should be observable after a short initial excitation of electrons into the conduction band. This peak has a characteristic dependence on the magnetic field and should be observable on sub-picosecond time scales.

Using cluster theory to calculate the experimental structure factors of antibody solutions,Circling particles and drafting in optical vortices,True,"Monoclonal antibody solutions are set to become a major therapeutic tool in the years to come, capable of targeting various diseases by clever designing their antigen binding site. However, the formulation of stable solutions suitable for patient self-administration typically presents challenges, as a result of the increase in viscosity that often occurs at high concentrations. Here, we establish a link between the microscopic molecular details and the resulting properties of an antibody solution through the characterization of clusters, which arise in the presence of self-associating antibodies. In particular, we find that experimental small-angle X-ray scattering data can be interpreted by means of analytical models previously exploited for the study of polymeric and colloidal objects, based on the presence of such clusters. The latter are determined by theoretical calculations and supported by computer simulations of a coarse-grained minimal model, in which antibodies are treated as Y-shaped colloidal molecules and attractive domains are designed as patches. Using the theoretically-predicted cluster size distributions, we are able to describe the experimental structure factors over a wide range of concentration and salt conditions. We thus provide microscopic evidence for the well-established fact that the concentration-dependent increase in viscosity is originated by the presence of clusters. Our findings bring new insights on the self-assembly of monoclonal antibodies, which can be exploited for guiding the formulation of stable and effective antibody solutions.",Particles suspended in a viscous fluid circle in optical vortices generated by holographic optical-tweezer techniques [Curtis J E and Grier D G 2003 Phys.

Massless scalar field in de Sitter spacetime: unitary quantum time evolution,Holographic Cosmology $n$-point function map from the Wavefunction of the Universe,True,"We prove that, under the standard conformal scaling, a massless field in de Sitter spacetime admits an O(4)-invariant Fock quantization such that time evolution is unitarily implemented. This result disproves previous claims in the literature. We discuss the relationship between this quantization with unitary dynamics and the family of O(4)-invariant Hadamard states given by Allen and Folacci, as well as with the Bunch-Davies vacuum.","In this note we show explicitly that, applying an extension of Maldacena's map for the wavefunction of the Universe $Z[\phi]=\Psi[\phi]$ from de Sitter inflation to holographic cosmology, we find the relations previously derived for 2-point functions, $\langle h_{ij}(p) h_{kl}(-p)\rangle \sim 1/[{\rm Im}\langle T_{ij}(-ip)T_{kl}(+ip)\rangle]$ and a similar one for currents, which were used to show that holographic cosmology matches CMBR data and solves Big Bang problems as well as inflation. Higher point functions are done similarly, and as an application, we check the result for the 3-point functions of scalar and tensor fluctuations and find the result for the monopole non-Gaussianity arising from the 3-point functions of currents.

The Role of N2 as a Geo-Biosignature for the Detection and Characterization of Earth-like Habitats,The Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler (HEK): V. A Survey of 41 Planetary Candidates for Exomoons,True,"Since the Archean, N2 has been a major atmospheric constituent in Earth's atmosphere. Nitrogen is an essential element in the building blocks of life, therefore the geobiological nitrogen cycle is a fundamental factor in the long term evolution of both Earth and Earth-like exoplanets. We discuss the development of the Earth's N2 atmosphere since the planet's formation and its relation with the geobiological cycle. Then we suggest atmospheric evolution scenarios and their possible interaction with life forms: firstly, for a stagnant-lid anoxic world, secondly for a tectonically active anoxic world, and thirdly for an oxidized tectonically active world. Furthermore, we discuss a possible demise of present Earth's biosphere and its effects on the atmosphere. Since life forms are the most efficient means for recycling deposited nitrogen back into the atmosphere nowadays, they sustain its surface partial pressure at high levels. Also, the simultaneous presence of significant N2 and O2 is chemically incompatible in an atmosphere over geological timescales. Thus, we argue that an N2-dominated atmosphere in combination with O2 on Earth-like planets within circumstellar habitable zones can be considered as a geo-biosignature. Terrestrial planets with such atmospheres will have an operating tectonic regime connected with an aerobe biosphere, whereas other scenarios in most cases end up with a CO2-dominated atmosphere. We conclude with implications for the search for life on Earth-like exoplanets inside the habitable zones of M to K-stars.","We present a survey of 41 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) for exomoons using Bayesian photodynamics, more than tripling the number of KOIs surveyed with this technique. We find no compelling evidence for exomoons although thirteen KOIs yield spurious detections driven by instrumental artifacts, stellar activity and/or perturbations from unseen bodies. Regarding the latter, we find seven KOIs exhibiting >5 sigma evidence of transit timing variations, including the 'mega-Earth' Kepler-10c, likely indicating an additional planet in that system. We exploit the moderately large sample of 57 unique KOIs surveyed to date to infer several useful statistics. For example, although there is a diverse range in sensitivities, we find that we are sensitive to Pluto-Charon mass-ratio systems for ~40% of KOIs studied and Earth-Moon mass-ratios for 1 in 8 cases. In terms of absolute mass, our limits probe down to 1.7 Ganymede masses, with a sensitivity to Earth-mass moons for 1 in 3 cases studied and to the smallest moons capable of sustaining an Earth-like atmosphere (0.3 Earth masses) for 1 in 4. Despite the lack of positive detections to date, we caution against drawing conclusions yet, since our most interesting objects remain under analysis. Finally, we point out that had we searched for the photometric transit signals of exomoons alone, rather than using photodynamics, we estimate that 1 in 4 KOIs would have erroneously been concluded to harbor exomoons due to residual time correlated noise in the Kepler data, posing a serious problem for alternative methods.",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"Earth and planetary astrophysics focuses on interplanetary medium, planetary physics, planetary astrobiology, extrasolar planets, comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

Comparison of Chiral Perturbation Theory and QCD Sum Rule Results for Pseudoscalar Isoscalar-Isovector Mixing,The study of fusion barriers of neutron-rich colliding nuclei using various isospin-dependent potentials,True,"The forms of the neutral, non-strange pseudoscalar propagator matrix and mixed axial current correlator, $\lngle0|T(A_\mu^3 A_\nu^8)|0\rangle$, are discussed at next-to-leading (one-loop) order in chiral perturbation theory, and the results compared to those obtained using QCD sum rules. This comparison provides a check of the truncations employed in the sum rule treatment of the current correlator. Values for the slope of the correlator with $q^2$ in the two approaches are found to differ by more than an order of magnitude and the source of this discrepancy is shown to be the incorrect chiral behavior of the sum rule result.","A detailed study fusion of neutron-rich colliding nuclei is performed using various isospin dependent potentials.

Bootstrapping a Five-Loop Amplitude Using Steinmann Relations,Prospects and Problems of Tachyon Matter Cosmology,True,"The analytic structure of scattering amplitudes is restricted by Steinmann relations, which enforce the vanishing of certain discontinuities of discontinuities. We show that these relations dramatically simplify the function space for the hexagon function bootstrap in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Armed with this simplification, along with the constraints of dual conformal symmetry and Regge exponentiation, we obtain the complete five-loop six-particle amplitude.","We consider the evolution of FRW cosmological models and linear perturbations of tachyon matter rolling towards a minimum of its potential. The tachyon coupled to gravity is described by an effective 4d field theory of string theory tachyon. In the model where a tachyon potential $V(T)$ has a quadratic minimum at finite value of the tachyon field $T_0$ and $V(T_0)=0$, the tachyon condensate oscillates around its minimum with a decreasing amplitude. It is shown that its effective equation of state is $p=-\epsilon/3$. However, linear inhomogeneous tachyon fluctuations coupled to the oscillating background condensate are exponentially unstable due to the effect of parametric resonance. In another interesting model, where tachyon potential exponentially approaches zero at infinity of $T$, rolling tachyon condensate in an expanding universe behaves as pressureless fluid. Its linear fluctuations coupled with small metric perturbations evolve similar to these in the pressureless fluid. However, this linear stage changes to a strongly non-linear one very early, so that the usual quasi-linear stage observed at sufficiently large scales in the present Universe may not be realized in the absence of the usual particle-like cold dark matter.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Towards A Holographic Model of Color Superconductivity,Thick brane models in generalized mimetic gravity,True,"In this note, we discuss the basic elements that should appear in a gravitational system dual to a confining gauge theory displaying color superconductivity at large baryon density. We consider a simple system with these minimal elements, and show that for a range of parameters, the phase structure of this model as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential exhibits phases that can be identified with confined, deconfined, and color superconducting phases in the dual field theory. We find that the critical temperature at which the superconducting phase disappears is remarkably small (relative to the chemical potential). This small number arises from the dynamics, and is unrelated to any small parameter in the model that we study. We discuss similar models which exhibit flavor superconductivity.","In this work, we investigate braneworld models in mimetic gravity, with the source field having generalized dynamics.

The proof is based on a careful analysis of the first two orders of the perturbation theory.,"We consider constructing the relativistic system of collective coordinates of a field theory soliton on the basis of a simple principle: The collective coordinates must be introduced into the static solution in such a way that the equation of motion of the collective coordinates ensures that of the original field theory. As an illustration, we apply this principle to the quantization of spinning motion of the Skyrmion by incorporating the leading relativistic correction to the rigid body approximation. We calculate the decay constant and various static properties of nucleons, and find that the relativistic corrections are in the range of 5% -- 20%.

In the presence of the FI term, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at tree level (on the Coulomb branch), leaving a pseudo-flat direction in the classical potential. This vacuum degeneracy is removed once quantum corrections are taken into account. Due to the SU(2) gauge dynamics, the effective potential exhibits a local minimum at the dyon point, where not only supersymmetry but also U(1)_R symmetry is broken, while a supersymmetric vacuum would be realized toward infinity with the runaway behavior of the potential. This local minimum is found to be parametrically long-lived.

These fields are embedded in a perfectly conducting fluid bounded by a pair of rigid plates where each field is anchored, taking the plates perpendicular to the uniform field. Those force-free fields obtainable from the uniform field by continuous magnetic footpoint displacements at the plates have field topologies that are shown to be a restricted subset of the field topologies similarly created without imposing the force-free equilibirum condition.

Distinct core and halo stellar populations and the formation history of the bright Coma cluster early-type galaxy NGC 4889,The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS): X-ray Properties and Scaling Relations of Galaxy Clusters and Groups,True,"We study the stellar population far into the halo of one of the two brightest galaxies in the Coma cluster, NGC 4889, based on deep medium resolution spectroscopy with FOCAS at the Subaru 8.2m telescope. We fit single stellar population models to the measured line-strength (Lick) indices (Hbeta, Mgb, [MgFe]' and <Fe>). Combining with literature data, we construct radial profiles of metallicity, [alpha/Fe] element abundance ratio and age for NGC 4889, from the center out to ~60 kpc (~4Re). We find evidence for different chemical and star formation histories for stars inside and outside 1.2Re = 18 kpc radius. The inner regions are characterized by a steep [Z/H] gradient and high [alpha/Fe] at ~2.5 times solar value. In the halo, between 18 and 60 kpc, the [Z/H] is near-solar with a shallow gradient, while [alpha/Fe] shows a strong negative gradient, reaching solar values at ~60 kpc. We interpret these data in terms of different formation histories for both components. The data for the inner galaxy are consistent with a rapid, quasi-monolithic, dissipative merger origin at early redshifts, followed by one or at most a few dry mergers. Those for the halo argue for later accretion of stars from old systems with more extended star formation histories. The half-light radius of the inner component alone is estimated as ~6 kpc, suggesting a significantly smaller size of this galaxy in the past. This may be the local stellar population signature of the size evolution found for early-type galaxies from high-redshift observations.","We investigate the scaling relations between X-ray observables of the clusters detected in the eFEDS field using Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma/eROSITA observations taking into account the selection effects and the distributions of observables with cosmic time. We extract X-ray observables (Lx, Lbol, T, Mgas, Yx) within R500 for the sample of 542 clusters in the eFEDS field. By applying detection and extent likelihoods, we construct a subsample of 265 clusters with a contamination level of <10% (including AGNs and spurious fluctuations) to be utilized in the scaling relation analysis. The selection function based on the state-of-the-art simulations of the eROSITA sky is fully accounted for in our work. We provide the X-ray observables in the core-included <R500 and core-excised 0.15*R500-R500 apertures for 542 galaxy clusters and groups detected in the eFEDS field. Additionally, we present our best-fit results for the normalization, slope, redshift evolution and intrinsic scatter parameters of the X-ray scaling relations between Lx-T, Lx-Mgas, Lx-Yx, Lbol-T, Lbol-Mgas, Lbol-Yx and Mgas-T. We find that the best-fit slopes significantly deviate from the self-similar model at a >3sigma confidence level however, our results are in good agreement with the simulations including non-gravitational physics and the recent results that take into account selection effects. Strong deviations we find from the self-similar scenario indicate that the non-gravitational effects play an important role in shaping the observed physical state of clusters.

Structure of light and heavy pentaquarks,A General Analysis of $\gamma$ Determinations from $B\to\pi K$ Decays,True,Light and heavy pentaquarks are described within a constituent quark model based on a spin-flavor hyperfine interaction. In this model the lowest state acquires positive parity. The masses of the light antidecuplet members are calculated dynamically using a variational method. It is shown that the octet and antidecuplet states with the same quantum numbers mix ideally due to SU(3)$_F$ breaking. Masses of the charmed antisextet pentaquarks are predicted within the same model.,"We present a general parametrization of $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm K, \pi^0K^\pm$ and $B_d\to\pi^0 K, \pi^\mp K^\pm$ decays, taking into account both electroweak penguin and rescattering effects. This formalism allows -- among other things -- an improved implementation of the strategies that were recently proposed by Neubert and Rosner to probe the CKM angle $\gamma$ with the help of $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm K, \pi^0K^\pm$ decays. In particular, it allows us to investigate the sensitivity of the extracted value of $\gamma$ to the basic assumptions of their approach. We find that certain SU(3)-breaking effects may have an important impact and emphasize that additional hadronic uncertainties are due to rescattering processes. The latter can be controlled by using SU(3) flavour symmetry arguments and additional experimental information provided by $B^\pm\to K^\pm K$ modes. We propose a new strategy to probe the angle $\gamma$ with the help of the neutral decays $B_d\to\pi^0 K, \pi^\mp K^\pm$, which is theoretically cleaner than the $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm K, \pi^0K^\pm$ approach. Here rescattering processes can be taken into account by just measuring the CP-violating observables of the decay $B_d\to\pi^0K_{\rm S}$. Finally, we point out that an experimental analysis of $B_s\to K^+K^-$ modes would also be very useful to probe the CKM angle $\gamma$, as well as electroweak penguins, and we critically compare the virtues and weaknesses of the various approaches discussed in this paper. As a by-product, we point out a strategy to include the electroweak penguins in the determination of the CKM angle $\alpha$ from $B\to\pi\pi$ decays.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Comparative High Field Magneto-Transport of Rare Earth Oxypnictides with Maximum Transition Temperatures,Scaling between magnetic and lattice fluctuations in iron-pnictide superconductors,True,"The recent discovery of a new class of superconducting oxypnictides with high transition temperatures may have profound implications for understanding unconventional high-temperature superconductivity. Like the cuprates, the oxypnictides seem to manifest an interleaving of charge donor and superconducting layers emerging upon doping of an antiferromagnetic parent semi-metal. Here we report magneto-transport measurements of three rare earth (Re = La, Nd, Sm) oxypnicide compounds with the transition temperatures near the maximum reported to date, in very high DC and pulsed magnetic fields up to 45 and 54 T, respectively. Our resistivity, Hall coefficient and critical magnetic fields data suggest that these oxypnictide superconductors bridge the gap between MgB$_2$ and YBaCu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ as far as electromagnetic and vortex properties are concerned.","The phase diagram of the iron arsenides is dominated by a magnetic and a structural phase transition, which need to be suppressed in order for superconductivity to appear. The proximity between the two transition temperature lines indicates correlation between these two phases, whose nature remains unsettled. Here, we find a scaling relation between nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and shear modulus data in the tetragonal phase of electron-doped $\mathrm{Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}}$ compounds. Because the former probes the strength of magnetic fluctuations while the latter is sensitive to orthorhombic fluctuations, our results provide strong evidence for a magnetically-driven structural transition.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

An introduction to the finite element method is given with emphasis on the suitability of the method to nanoplasmonic device simulation. The effects of nanoparticle shape on the spectral position and lineshape of the plasmonic resonance are discussed including retardation and surface curvature effects.

Thermodynamic instability of doubly spinning black objects,Cosmology with modified continuity equation in asymptotically safe gravity,True,We investigate the thermodynamic stability of neutral black objects with (at least) two angular momenta. We use the quasilocal formalism to compute the grand canonical potential and show that the doubly spinning black ring is thermodynamically unstable. We consider the thermodynamic instabilities of ultra-spinning black objects and point out a subtle relation between the microcanonical and grand canonical ensembles. We also find the location of the black string/membrane phases of doubly spinning black objects.,"We study FLRW cosmology, taking into account quantum gravitational corrections in the formalism of the exact renormalization group flow of the effective action for gravity. We calculate the quantum corrected scale factor, energy density, and entropy production at late times, taking different cut-off functions. Our approach differs from previous ones in the way energy-momentum conservation is imposed -- we include the running Newton constant $G(k)$ in the definition of energy-momentum tensor, keeping in mind the covariant conservation identity of the Einstein tensor. The quantum corrections obtained in this approach are different from what are found by letting the conservation equation remain the same as for a scale-independent Newton constant. We also find that for a specific choice of the cut-off scale, the quantum corrected behaviour of the Newton constant and the cosmological constant lead to a bouncing emergent universe solution.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Relational evolution of effectively interacting GFT quantum gravity condensates,"R-symmetry breaking, runaway directions and global symmetries in O'Raifeartaigh models",True,"We study the impact of effective interactions onto relationally evolving GFT condensates based on real-valued fields. In a first step we show that a free condensate configuration in an isotropic restriction settles dynamically into a low-spin configuration of the quantum geometry. This goes hand in hand with the accelerated and exponential expansion of its volume, as well as the vanishing of its relative uncertainty which suggests the classicalization of the quantum geometry. The dynamics of the emergent space can then be given in terms of the classical Friedmann equations. In contrast to models based on complex-valued fields, solutions avoiding the singularity problem can only be found if the initial conditions are appropriately chosen. We then turn to the analysis of the influence of effective interactions on the dynamics by studying in particular the Thomas-Fermi regime. In this context, at the cost of fine-tuning, an epoch of inflationary expansion of quantum geometric origin can be implemented. Finally, and for the first time, we study anisotropic GFT condensate configurations and show that such systems tend to isotropize quickly as the value of the relational clock grows. This paves the way to a more systematic investigation of anisotropies in the context of GFT condensate cosmology.","We discuss O'Raifeartaigh models with general R-charge assignments, introduced by Shih to break R-symmetry spontaneously. We argue that most of these models have runaway directions related to the R-symmetry. In addition, we study the simplest model with a U(N) global symmetry and show that in a range of parameters R-symmetry is spontaneously broken in a metastable vacuum.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Non-oscillating Early Dark Energy and Quintessence from Alpha-Attractors,Spectrum of Massive and Massless Ambitwistor Strings,True,"Early dark energy (EDE) is one of the most promising possibilities in order to resolve the Hubble tension: the discrepancy between early and late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant. In this paper we propose a model of a scalar field which can explain both EDE and late Dark Energy (DE) in a joined manner without additional fine-tuning. The field features kinetic poles as with alpha-attractors. Our model provides an injection of EDE near matter-radiation equality, and redshifts away shortly after via free-fall, later refreezing to become late-time DE at the present day. Using reasonable estimates of the current constraints on EDE from the literature, we find that the parameter space is narrow but viable. As such our model is readily falsifiable. In contrast to other work in EDE, our model is non-oscillatory, which causes its decay to be faster than that of the usual oscillatory EDE, thereby achieving better agreement with observations.","Inspired by recent work arXiv:2301.11227 on massive ambitwistor strings this paper examines the spectrum of such models using oscillator expansions. The spectrum depends heavily on the constant related to the normal ordering of the zero mode operator ${L_0}$ of the Virasoro algebra. The supergravity model is investigated in more detail, and two anomaly-free variations are presented, both with a rich spectrum and with tree scattering amplitudes that include a kinematic Parke-Taylor factor for particles other than gravitons without a need for an external current algebra. The spectrum of some of the models can also be interpreted as containing three generations of the Pati-Salam model.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Neutral pion and $\eta$ meson production in p-Pb collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV,First observation of an attractive interaction between a proton and a multi-strange baryon,True,"Neutral pion and $\eta$ meson invariant differential yields were measured in non-single diffractive p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC. The analysis combines results from three complementary photon measurements, utilizing the PHOS and EMCal calorimeters and the Photon Conversion Method. The invariant differential yields of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ meson inclusive production are measured near mid-rapidity in a broad transverse momentum range of $0.3<p_{\rm T}< 20$ GeV/$c$ and $0.7<p_{\rm T}<20$ GeV/$c$, respectively. The measured $\eta$/$\pi^{0}$ ratio increases with $p_{\rm T}$ and saturates for $p_{\rm T} > 4$ GeV/$c$ at $0.483\pm 0.015_{\rm stat}\pm 0.015_{\rm sys}$. A deviation from $m_{\rm T}$ scaling is observed for $p_{\rm T}<2$ GeV/$c$. The measured $\eta$/$\pi^{0}$ ratio is consistent with previous measurements from proton-nucleus and pp collisions over the full $p_{\rm T}$ range. The measured $\eta$/$\pi^{0}$ ratio at high $p_{\rm T}$ also agrees within uncertainties with measurements from nucleus-nucleus collisions. The $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ yields in p-Pb relative to the scaled pp interpolated reference, $R_{\rm pPb}$, are presented for $0.3<p_{\rm T}<20$ GeV/$c$ and $0.7<p_{\rm T}< 20$ GeV/$c$, respectively. The results are compared with theoretical model calculations. The values of $R_{\rm pPb}$ are consistent with unity for transverse momenta above 2 GeV/$c$. These results support the interpretation that the suppressed yield of neutral mesons measured in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies is due to parton energy loss in the hot QCD medium.","This work presents the first experimental observation of the attractive strong interaction between a proton and a multi-strange baryon (hyperon) $\Xi^-$. The result is extracted from two-particle correlations of combined $\rm{p}-\Xi^{-}$$\oplus$$\rm{\bar{p}}-\bar{\Xi}^{+}$ pairs measured in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV at the LHC with ALICE. The measured correlation function is compared with the prediction obtained assuming only an attractive Coulomb interaction and a standard deviation in the range $[3.6,5.3]$ is found. Since the measured $\rm{p}-\Xi^{-}$$\oplus$$\rm{\bar{p}}-\bar{\Xi}^{+}$ correlation is significantly enhanced with respect to the Coulomb prediction, the presence of an additional, strong, attractive interaction is evident. The data are compatible with recent lattice calculations by the HAL-QCD Collaboration, with a standard deviation in the range $ [1.8,3.7]$. The lattice potential predicts a shallow repulsive $\Xi^-$ interaction within pure neutron matter at saturation densities and this implies stiffer equations of state for neutron-rich matter including hyperons.

Holographic thermalization and Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse,Quantum Corrections to the Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman Metrics: Spin 1,True,"The Oppenheimer-Snyder model, which describes the gravitational collapse of a ball of dust, can be used to model thermalization of strongly coupled systems using the AdS/CFT-duality. It can be used as an alternative to the previously widely used thin-shell model in the context of holographic thermalization. We solve the dynamics of the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse in asymptotically AdS space-times and compute the two-point function of a boundary spectator field in the geodesic approximation. As a comparison we perform the same computation in the thin-shell model and discover oscillatory solutions of the thin-shell model for certain equations of state.",A previous evaluation of one-photon loop corrections to the energy-momentum tensor has been extended to particles with unit spin and speculations are presented concerning general properties of such forms.,High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Active Colloidal Loops and Knots,Defect unbinding in active nematics,True,"We present an asymptotic theory for solving the dynamics of slender autophoretic loops and knots. Our formulation is valid for non-intersecting 3D centrelines, with arbitrary chemical patterning and varying (circular) cross-sectional radius, allowing a broad class of slender active loops and knots to be studied. The theory is amenable to closed-form solutions in simpler cases, allowing us to analytically derive the swimming speed of chemically patterned tori, and the pumping strength (stresslet) of a uniformly active slender torus. Using simple numerical solutions of our asymptotic equations, we then elucidate the behaviour of many exotic active colloids, such as a bumpy uniformly active torus that spins and a Janus trefoil knot, which rotates as it swims forwards.","We formulate the statistical dynamics of topological defects in the active nematic phase, formed in two dimensions by a collection of self-driven particles on a substrate. An important consequence of the non-equilibrium drive is the spontaneous motility of strength +1/2 disclinations. Starting from the hydrodynamic equations of active nematics, we derive an interacting particle description of defects that includes active torques. We show that activity, within perturbation theory, lowers the defect-unbinding transition temperature, determining a critical line in the temperature-activity plane that separates the quasi-long-range ordered (nematic) and disordered (isotropic) phases. Below a critical activity, defects remain bound as rotational noise decorrelates the directed dynamics of +1/2 defects, stabilizing the quasi-long-range ordered nematic state. This activity threshold vanishes at low temperature, leading to a re-entrant transition. At large enough activity, active forces always exceed thermal ones and the perturbative result fails, suggesting that in this regime activity will always disorder the system. Crucially, rotational diffusion being a two-dimensional phenomenon, defect unbinding cannot be described by a simplified one-dimensional model.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

The formation of the young massive cluster B1 in the Antennae galaxies (NGC 4038/NGC 4039) triggered by cloud-cloud collision,"A millimeter-wave redshift search for the unlensed HyLIRG, HS1700.850.1",True,"The Antennae Galaxies is one of the starbursts in major mergers. Tsuge et al. (2020) showed that the five giant molecular complexes in the Antennae Galaxies have signatures of cloud-cloud collisions based on the ALMA archival data at 60 pc resolution. In the present work we analyzed the new CO data toward the super star cluster (SSC) B1 at 14 pc resolution obtained with ALMA, and confirmed that two clouds show complementary distribution with a displacement of $\sim$70 pc as well as the connecting bridge features between them. The complementary distribution shows a good correspondence with the theoretical collision model (Takahira et al. 2014), and indicates that SSC B1 having $\sim$10$^{6}$ $M$$_{\odot}$ was formed by the trigger of a cloud-cloud collision with a time scale of $\sim$1Myr, which is consistent with the cluster age. It is likely that SSC B1 was formed from molecular gas of $\sim$10$^{7}$ $M$$_{\odot}$ with a star formation efficiency of $\sim$10 % in 1 Myr. We identified a few places where additional clusters are forming. Detailed gas motion indicates stellar feedback in accelerating gas is not effective, while ionization plays a role in evacuating the gas around the clusters at a $\sim$30-pc radius. The results have revealed the details of the parent gas where a cluster having mass similar to a globular is being formed.","We report the redshift of an unlensed, highly obscured submillimetre galaxy (SMG), HS1700.850.1, the brightest SMG (S850um =19.1 mJy) detected in the JCMT/SCUBA-2 Baryonic Structure Survey, based on the detection of its CO line emission. Using the IRAM PdBI-WIDEX with 3.6GHz band width, we serendipitously detect an emission line at 150.6 GHz. From a search over 14.5 GHz in the 3-mm and 2-mm atmospheric windows, we confirm the identification of this line as CO(5-4) at z = 2.816, meaning that it does not reside in the z~2.30 proto-cluster in this field. Measurement of the 870um source size (<0.85"") from the Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) confirms a compact emission in a S870um =14.5mJy, LIR~10^13 Lsun component, suggesting an Eddington-limited starburst. We use the double-peaked CO line profile measurements along with the SMA size constraints to study the gas dynamics of a HyLIRG, estimating the gas and dynamical masses of HS1700.850.1. While HS1700.850.1 is one of the most extreme galaxies known in the Universe, we find that it occupies a relative void in the Lyman-Break Galaxy distribution in this field. Comparison with other extreme objects at similar epochs (HyLIRG Quasars), and cosmological simulations, suggests such an anti-bias of bright SMGs could be relatively common, with the brightest SMGs rarely occupying the most overdense regions at z=2-4.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Spectral performance of the Microchannel X-ray Telescope on board the SVOM mission,A model for 3:2 HFQPO pairs in black hole binaries based on cosmic battery,True,"The Microchannel X-ray Telescope (MXT) is an innovative compact X-ray instrument on board the SVOM astronomical mission dedicated to the study of transient phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts. During 3 weeks, we have tested the MXT flight model at the Panter X-ray test facility under the nominal temperature and vacuum conditions that MXT will undergo in-flight. We collected data at series of characteristic energies probing the entire MXT energy range, from 0.28 keV up to 9 keV, for multiple source positions with the center of the point spread function (PSF) inside and outside the detector field of view (FOV). We stacked the data of the positions with the PSF outside the FOV to obtain a uniformly illuminated matrix and reduced all data sets using a dedicated pipeline. We determined the best spectral performance of MXT using an optimized data processing, especially for the energy calibration and the charge sharing effect induced by the pixel low energy thresholding. Our results demonstrate that MXT is compliant with the instrument requirement regarding the energy resolution (<80 eV at 1.5 keV), the low and high energy threshold, and the accuracy of the energy calibration ($\pm$20 eV). We also determined the charge transfer inefficiency (~$10^{-5}$) of the detector and modeled its evolution with energy prior to the irradiation that MXT will undergo during its in-orbit lifetime. Finally, we measured the relation of the energy resolution as function of the photon energy. We determined an equivalent noise charge of 4.9 $\pm$ 0.2 e- rms for the MXT detection chain and a Fano factor of 0.131 $\pm$ 0.003 in silicon at 208 K, in agreement with previous works. This campaign confirmed the promising scientific performance that MXT will be able to deliver during the mission lifetime.","A model for 3:2 high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) with 3:2 pairs observed in four black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) is proposed by invoking the epicyclic resonances with the magnetic connection (MC) between a spinning black hole (BH) with a relativistic accretion disc. It turns out that the MC can be worked out due to Poynting-Robertson cosmic battery (PRCB), and the 3:2 HFQPO pairs associated with the steep power-law states can be fitted in this model. Furthermore, the severe damping problem in the epicyclic resonance model can be overcome by transferring energy from the BH to the inner disc via the MC process for emitting X-rays with sufficient amplitude and coherence to produce the HFQPOs.

Simultaneous X-ray and Radio Observations of Rotating Radio Transient J1819-1458,Afterglow of binary neutron star merger,True,"We present the results of simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of PSR J1819-1458. Our 94-ks XMM-Newton observation of the high magnetic field 5*10^13 G pulsar reveals a blackbody spectrum (kT~130 eV) with a broad absorption feature, possibly composed of two lines at ~1.0 and ~1.3 keV. We performed a correlation analysis of the X-ray photons with radio pulses detected in 16.2 hours of simultaneous observations at 1-2 GHz with the Green Bank, Effelsberg, and Parkes telescopes, respectively. Both the detected X-ray photons and radio pulses appear to be randomly distributed in time. We find tentative evidence for a correlation between the detected radio pulses and X-ray photons on timescales of less than 10 pulsar spin periods, with the probability of this occurring by chance being 0.46%. This suggests that the physical process producing the radio pulses may also heat the polar-cap.","The merger of two neutron stars results often in a rapidly and differentially rotating hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). We show by numerical-relativity simulation that the magnetic-field profile around such HMNS is dynamically varied during its subsequent evolution, and as a result, electromagnetic radiation with a large luminosity ~ 0.1 B^2 R^3 Omega is emitted with baryon (B, R, and Omega are poloidal magnetic-field strength at stellar surface, stellar radius, and angular velocity of a HMNS). The predicted luminosity of electromagnetic radiation, which is primarily emitted along the magnetic-dipole direction, is ~ 10^{47} (B/10^{13} G)^2(R/10 km)^3(Omega/10^4 rad/s) ergs/s, that is comparable to the luminosity of quasars.",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"High energy astrophysical phenomena focuses on cosmic ray production, acceleration, propagation, detection.

Wide Field Imaging of van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 by Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride,Experimental realization of a silicon spin field-effect transistor,True,"Emergent color centers with accessible spins hosted by van der Waals materials have attracted substantial interest in recent years due to their significant potential for implementing transformative quantum sensing technologies. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is naturally relevant in this context due to its remarkable ease of integration into devices consisting of low-dimensional materials. Taking advantage of boron vacancy spin defects in hBN, we report nanoscale quantum imaging of low-dimensional ferromagnetism sustained in Fe3GeTe2/hBN van der Waals heterostructures. Exploiting spin relaxometry methods, we have further observed spatially varying magnetic fluctuations in the exfoliated Fe3GeTe2 flake, whose magnitude reaches a peak value around the Curie temperature.

Probing Chiral Symmetry Restoration with Heavy Ions,Degeneracies when T=0 Two Body Interacting Matrix Elements are Set Equal to Zero : Talmi's method of calculating coefficients of fractional parentage to states forbidden by the Pauli principle,True,It is discussed how chiral symmetry restoration manifests itself through mixing of vector and axial-vector correlators. The vector correlator is directly accessible in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within models of the vector correlator its implications for low-mass dilepton spectra are reviewed.,"In a previous work we studied the effects of setting all two body T=0 matrix elements to zero in shell model calculations for $^{43}$Ti ($^{43}$Sc) and $^{44}$Ti. The results for $^{44}$Ti were surprisingly good despite the severity of this approximation. In this approximation degeneracies arose in the T=1/2 I=$({1/2})^-_1$ and $({13/2})^-_1$ states in $^{43}$Sc and the T=1/2 $I=({13/2})_2^-$, $({17/2})^-_1$, and $({19/2})_1^-$ in $^{43}$Sc. The T=0 $3_2^+$, $7_2^+$, $9_1^+$, and $10_1^+$ states in $^{44}$Ti were degenerate as well. The degeneracies can be explained by certain 6j symbols and 9j symbols either vanishing or being equal as indeed they are. Previously we used Regge symmetries of 6j symbols to explain these degeneracies. In this work a simpler more physical method is used. This is Talmi's method of calculating coefficients of fractional parentage for identical particles to states which are forbidden by the Pauli principle. This is done for both one particle cfp to handle 6j symbols and two particle cfp to handle 9j symbols.

Affleck-Dine Baryogenesis and Inflation in Supergravity with Strongly Stabilized Moduli,The NNLO QCD analysis ofthe CCFR data for $xF_3$: $Q^2$-dependence of the parameters,True,"Constructing models of inflation and/or baryogenesis in the context of N=1 supergravity is known to be difficult as the finite energy density during inflation typically generates large (order the Hubble scale) mass terms. This is the well-known eta problem in inflation. The same effect gives masses along low energy flat directions of the scalar potential thus potentially preventing Affleck-Dine baryogenesis to occur. It has been shown that adding a chiral multiplet S coupled to the inflaton (with a shift symmetry) can serve to stabilize the inflationary potential and allows one to derive simple inflationary potentials without an eta problem. Here, we show that by coupling the same stabilizing field S to the flat direction, may naturally lead to a negative mass-squared contribution to the flat direction thus generating the necessarily large vacuum expectation value needed to realize Affleck-Dine baryogenesis.

Cosmic Microwave Background constraints for global strings and global monopoles,On the gauge orbit space stratification (a review),True,"We present the first CMB power spectra from numerical simulations of the global O(N) linear $\sigma$-model with N = 2,3, which have global strings and monopoles as topological defects. In order to compute the CMB power spectra we compute the unequal time correlators (UETCs) of the energy-momentum tensor, showing that they fall off at high wave number faster than naive estimates based on the geometry of the defects, indicating non-trivial (anti-)correlations between the defects and the surrounding Goldstone boson field. We obtain source functions for Einstein-Boltzmann solvers from the UETCs, using a recent method that improves the modelling at the radiation- matter transition. We show that the interpolation function that mimics the transition is similar to other defect models, but not identical, confirming the non-universality of the interpolation function. The CMB power spectra for global strings and monopoles have the same overall shape as those obtained using the non-linear $\sigma$-model approximation, which is well captured by a large-N calculation. However, the amplitudes are larger than the large-N calculation predict, and in the case of global strings much larger: a factor of 20 at the peak. Finally we compare the CMB power spectra with the latest CMB data to put limits on the allowed contribution to the temperature power spectrum at multipole $\ell$ = 10 of 1.7% for global strings and 2.4% for global monopoles. These limits correspond to symmetry-breaking scales of 2.9x1015 GeV (6.3x1014 GeV with the expected logarithmic scaling of the effective string tension between the simulation time and decoupling) and 6.4x1015 GeV respectively. The bound on global strings is a significant one for the ultra-light axion scenario with axion masses ma 10-28 eV. These upper limits indicate that gravitational wave from global topological defects will not be observable at the GW observatory LISA.","First, we review the basic mathematical structures and results concerning the gauge orbit space stratification. This includes general properties of the gauge group action, fibre bundle structures induced by this action, basic properties of the stratification and the natural Riemannian structures of the strata. In the second part, we study the stratification for theories with gauge group $\rmSU(n)$ in space time dimension 4. We develop a general method for determining the orbit types and their partial ordering, based on the 1-1 correspondence between orbit types and holonomy-induced Howe subbundles of the underlying principal $\rmSU(n)$-bundle. We show that the orbit types are classified by certain cohomology elements of space time satisfying two relations and that the partial ordering is characterized by a system of algebraic equations. Moreover, operations for generating direct successors and direct predecessors are formulated, which allow one to construct the set of orbit types, starting from the principal one. Finally, we discuss an application to nodal configurations in topological Chern-Simons theory.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Anisotropic charged dark energy star,Resonant Absorption between Moving Atoms due to Doppler Frequency Shift and Quantum Energy Variation,True,"As the stars carry electrical charges, we present in this paper a model for charged dark energy star which is singularity free. We take Krori-Barua space time. We assume that the radial pressure exerted on the system due to the presence of dark energy is proportional to the isotropic perfect fluid matter density and the difference between tangential and radial pressure is proportional to the square of the electric field intensity. The solution satisfies the physical conditions inside the star","By taking both the Doppler frequency shift for electromagnetic wave and the quantum energy variation of matter wave into consideration, a resonant-absorption condition based on the local-ether wave equation is presented to account for a variety of phenomena consistently, including the Ives-Stilwell experiment, the output frequency from ammonia masers, and the M\""{o}ssbauer rotor experiment. It is found that in the resonant-absorption condition, the major term associated with the laboratory velocity is a dot-product term between this velocity and that of the emitting or absorbing atom. This term appears both in the Doppler frequency shift and the transition frequency variation and then cancels out. Thereby, the experimental results can be independent of the laboratory velocity and hence comply with Galilean relativity, despite the restriction that the involved velocities are referred specifically to the local-ether frame. However, by examining the resonant-absorption condition in the M\""{o}ssbauer rotor experiment to a higher order, it is found that Galilean relativity breaks down.",General Physics,"General physics focuses on multidisciplinary topics, speculative ideas, and proposals that cover more than one area of physics.

Perturbative unitarity of Higgs derivative interactions,Effects of new physics on the Standard Model parameters and vice versa,True,"We study the perturbative unitarity bound given by dimension six derivative interactions consisting of Higgs doublets. These operators emerge from kinetic terms of composite Higgs models or integrating out heavy particles that interact with Higgs doublets. They lead to new phenomena beyond the Standard Model. One of characteristic contributions by derivative interactions appear in vector boson scattering processes. Longitudinal modes of massive vector bosons can be regarded as Nambu Goldstone bosons eaten by each vector field with the equivalence theorem. Since their effects become larger and larger as the collision energy of vector bosons increases, vector boson scattering processes become important in a high energy region around the TeV scale. On the other hand, in such a high energy region, we have to take the unitarity of amplitudes into account. We have obtained the unitarity condition in terms of the parameter included in the effective Lagrangian for one Higgs doublet models. Applying it to some of models, we have found that contributions of derivative interactions are not so large enough to clearly discriminate them from the Standard Model ones. We also study it in two Higgs doublet models. Because they are too complex to obtain the bound in the general effective Lagrangian, we have calculated it in explicit models. These analyses tell us highly model dependence of the perturbative unitarity bounds.","This note discusses the matter of probing Beyond the Standard Model physics and how, to succeed in this quest, the interpretations of the Standard Model regarding observed phenomena must be utilized with caution. We give several specific examples of why this is necessary and assess general scenarios in which it is specially important.

Relative Grain Boundary Energies from Triple Junction Geometry: Limitations to Assuming the Herring Condition in Nanocrystalline Thin Films,Defect Properties of Na and K in Cu2ZnSnS4 from Hybrid Functional Calculation,True,"Grain boundary character distributions (GBCD) are routinely measured from bulk microcrystalline samples by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and serial sectioning can be used to reconstruct relative grain boundary energy distributions (GBED) based on the 3D geometry of triple lines, assuming that the Herring condition of force balance is satisfied. These GBEDs correlate to those predicted from molecular dynamics (MD); furthermore, the GBCD and GBED are found to be inversely correlated. For nanocrystalline thin films, orientation mapping via precession enhanced electron diffraction (PED) has proven effective in measuring the GBCD, but the GBED has not been extracted. Here, the established relative energy extraction technique is adapted to PED data from four sputter deposited samples: a 40 nm-thick tungsten film and a 100 nm aluminum film as-deposited, after 30 and after 150 minutes annealing at 400{\deg}C. These films have columnar grain structures, so serial sectioning is not required to determine boundary inclination. Excepting the most energetically anisotropic and highest population boundaries, i.e. aluminum {\Sigma}3 boundaries, the relative GBED extracted from these data do not correlate with energies calculated using MD nor do they inversely correlate with the experimentally determined GBCD for either the tungsten or aluminum films. Failure to reproduce predicted energetic trends implies that the conventional Herring equation cannot be applied to determine relative GBEDs and thus geometries at triple junctions in these films are not well described by this condition; additional geometric factors must contribute to determining triple junction geometry and boundary network structure in spatially constrained, polycrystalline materials.","In-growth or post-deposition treatment of $Cu_{2}ZnSnS_{4}$ (CZTS) absorber layer had led to improved photovoltaic efficiency, however, the underlying physical mechanism of such improvements are less studied. In this study, the thermodynamics of Na and K related defects in CZTS are investigated from first principle approach using hybrid functional, with chemical potential of Na and K established from various phases of their polysulphides. Both Na and K predominantly substitute on Cu sites similar to their behavior in $Cu(In,Ga)Se_{2}$, in contrast to previous results using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). All substitutional and interstitial defects are shown to be either shallow levels or highly energetically unfavorable.

Theory of diffusive {\phi}0 Josephson junctions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling,Phase Diagram of Ba1-xKxFe2As2,True,"We present a full microscopic theory based on the SU(2) covariant formulation of the quasiclassical formalism to describe the Josephson current through an extended superconductor-normal metal- superconductor (SNS) diffusive junction with an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the presence of a spin-splitting field h. We demonstrate that the ground state of the junction corresponds to a finite intrinsic phase difference 0 < {\phi}0 < 2{\pi} between the superconductor electrodes provided that both, h and the SOC-induced SU(2) Lorentz force are finite. In the particular case of a Rashba SOC we present analytic and numerical results for {\phi}0 as a function of the strengths of the spin fields, the length of the junction, the temperature and the properties of SN interfaces.","We report the results of a systematic investigation of the phase diagram of the iron-based superconductor, Ba1-xKxFe2As2, from x = 0 to x = 1.0 using high resolution neutron and x-ray diffraction and magnetization measurements. The polycrystalline samples were prepared with an estimated compositional variation of \Deltax <~ 0.01, allowing a more precise estimate of the phase boundaries than reported so far. At room temperature, Ba1-xKxFe2As2 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure with the space group symmetry of I4/mmm, but at low doping, the samples undergo a coincident first-order structural and magnetic phase transition to an orthorhombic (O) structure with space group Fmmm and a striped antiferromagnet (AF) with space group Fcmm'm'. The transition temperature falls from a maximum of 139K in the undoped compound to 0K at x = 0.252, with a critical exponent as a function of doping of 0.25(2) and 0.12(1) for the structural and magnetic order parameters, respectively. The onset of superconductivity occurs at a critical concentration of x = 0.130(3) and the superconducting transition temperature grows linearly with x until it crosses the AF/O phase boundary. Below this concentration, there is microscopic phase coexistence of the AF/O and superconducting order parameters, although a slight suppression of the AF/O order is evidence that the phases are competing. At higher doping, superconductivity has a maximum Tc of 38 K at x = 0.4 falling to 3 K at x = 1.0. We discuss reasons for the suppression of the spin-density-wave order and the electron-hole asymmetry in the phase diagram.",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

The dangers of being trigger--happy,Interstellar objects follow the collapse of molecular clouds,True,"We examine the evidence offered for triggered star formation against the backdrop provided by recent numerical simulations of feedback from massive stars at or below giant molecular cloud sizescales. We compile a catalogue of sixty--seven observational papers, mostly published over the last decade, and examine the signposts most commonly used to infer the presence of triggered star formation. We then determine how well these signposts perform in a recent suite of hydrodynamic simulations of star formation including feedback from O--type stars performed by Dale et al (2012a, b, 2013a, b, 2014). We find that none of the observational markers improve the chances of correctly identifying a given star as triggered by more than factors of two at most. This limits the fidelity of these techniques in interpreting star formation histories. We therefore urge caution in interpreting observations of star formation near feedback--driven structures in terms of triggering.","Interstellar objects (ISOs), the parent population of 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, are abundant in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way. This means that the interstellar medium, including molecular cloud regions, has three components: gas, dust, and ISOs. From the observational constraints for the field density of ISOs drifting in the solar neighbourhood, we infer a typical molecular cloud of 10 pc diameter contains some 10$^{18}$ ISOs. At typical sizes ranging from hundreds of metres to tens of km, ISOs are entirely decoupled from the gas dynamics in these molecular clouds. Here we address the question of whether ISOs can follow the collapse of molecular clouds. We perform low-resolution simulations of the collapse of molecular clouds containing initially static ISO populations toward the point where stars form. In this proof-of-principle study, we find that the interstellar objects definitely follow the collapse of the gas -- and many become bound to the new-forming numerical approximations to future stars (sinks). At minimum, 40\% of all sinks have one or more ISO test particles gravitationally bound to them for the initial ISO distributions tested here. This value corresponds to at least $10^{10}$ actual interstellar objects being bound after three initial free-fall times. Thus, ISOs are a relevant component of star formation. We find that more massive sinks bind disproportionately large fractions of the initial ISO population, implying competitive capture of ISOs. Sinks can also be solitary, as their ISOs can become unbound again -- particularly if sinks are ejected from the system. Emerging planetary systems will thus develop in remarkably varied environments, ranging from solitary to richly populated with bound ISOs.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

The ansatz for the geometry is inspired by calculations of the semi-classical stress-energy tensor in the Schwarzschild background and ideas from loop quantum gravity for a nonsingular transition to the white hole. In this paper the main emphasis is on the evolution of the black hole, and the evolution of the white hole is assumed to be essentially the time reverse of that of the black hole. The negative energy of the Hawking ""partners"" flows out of the white hole to future null infinity. The white hole disappears when the matter and radiation that collapsed to form the black hole emerges. I discuss the compatibility of the model with some of the quantum energy conditions proposed in the literature, and, briefly, the implications for the interpretation of black hole entropy.

Multi-State Image Restoration by Transmission of Bit-Decomposed Data,What makes slow samples slow in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model,True,"We report on the restoration of gray-scale image when it is decomposed into a binary form before transmission. We assume that a gray-scale image expressed by a set of Q-Ising spins is first decomposed into an expression using Ising (binary) spins by means of the threshold division, namely, we produce (Q-1) binary Ising spins from a Q-Ising spin by the function F(\sigma_i - m) = 1 if the input data \sigma_i \in {0,.....,Q-1} is \sigma_i \geq m and 0 otherwise, where m \in {1,....,Q-1} is the threshold value. The effects of noise are different from the case where the raw Q-Ising values are sent. We investigate which is more effective to use the binary data for transmission or to send the raw Q-Ising values. By using the mean-field model, we first analyze the performance of our method quantitatively. Then we obtain the static and dynamical properties of restoration using the bit-decomposed data. In order to investigate what kind of original picture is efficiently restored by our method, the standard image in two dimensions is simulated by the mean-field annealing, and we compare the performance of our method with that using the Q-Ising form. We show that our method is more efficient than the one using the Q-Ising form when the original picture has large parts in which the nearest neighboring pixels take close values.","Using results of a Monte Carlo simulation of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, we try to characterize the slow disorder samples, namely we analyze visually the correlation between the relaxation time for a given disorder sample $J$ with several observables of the system for the same disorder sample. For temperatures below $T_c$ but not too low, fast samples (small relaxation times) are clearly correlated with a small value of the largest eigenvalue of the coupling matrix, a large value of the site averaged local field probability distribution at the origin, or a small value of the squared overlap $<q^2>$. Within our limited data, the correlation remains as the system size increases but becomes less clear as the temperature is decreased (the correlation with $<q^2>$ is more robust) . There is a strong correlation between the values of the relaxation time for two distinct values of the temperature, but this correlation decreases as the system size is increased.

Productivity of Solar Flares and Magnetic Helicity Injection in Active Regions,Near-Sun and 1 AU magnetic field of coronal mass ejections: A parametric study,True,"The main objective of this study is to better understand how magnetic helicity injection in an active region is related to the occurrence and intensity of solar flares. We therefore investigate magnetic helicity injection rate and unsigned magnetic flux, as a reference. In total, 378 active regions are analyzed using $SOHO$/MDI magnetograms. The 24-hour averaged helicity injection rate and unsigned magnetic flux are compared with the flare index and the flare-productive probability in next 24 hours following an measurement. In addition, we study the variation of helicity over a span of several days around the times of the 19 flares above M5.0 which occurred in selected strong flare-productive active regions. The major findings of this study are: (1) for a sub-sample of 91 large active regions with unsigned magnetic fluxes in the range from 3 to 5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ Mx, there is a difference in magnetic helicity injection rate between flaring active regions and non-flaring active regions by a factor of 2; (2) the $GOES$ C-flare-productive probability as a function of helicity injection displays a sharp boundary between flare-productive active regions and flare-quiet ones; (3) the history of helicity injection before all the 19 major flares displayed a common characteristic: a significant helicity accumulation of (3-45)$ \times$ 10 $^{42}$ Mx$^2$ during a phase of monotonically increasing helicity over 0.5 to 2 days. Our results support the notion that helicity injection is important in flares, but it is not effective to use it alone for the purpose of flare forecast. It is necessary to find a way to better characterize the time history of helicity injection as well as its spatial distribution inside active regions.","Aims. The magnetic field of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) determines their structure, evolution, and energetics, as well as their geoeffectiveness. However, we currently lack routine diagnostics of the near-Sun CME magnetic field, which is crucial for determining the subsequent evolution of CMEs. Methods. We recently presented a method to infer the near-Sun magnetic field magnitude of CMEs and then extrapolate it to 1 AU. This method uses relatively easy to deduce observational estimates of the magnetic helicity in CME-source regions along with geometrical CME fits enabled by coronagraph observations. We hereby perform a parametric study of this method aiming to assess its robustness. We use statistics of active region (AR) helicities and CME geometrical parameters to determine a matrix of plausible near-Sun CME magnetic field magnitudes. In addition, we extrapolate this matrix to 1 AU and determine the anticipated range of CME magnetic fields at 1 AU representing the radial falloff of the magnetic field in the CME out to interplanetary (IP) space by a power law with index aB. Results. The resulting distribution of the near-Sun (at 10 Rs ) CME magnetic fields varies in the range [0.004, 0.02] G, comparable to, or higher than, a few existing observational inferences of the magnetic field in the quiescent corona at the same distance. We also find that a theoretically and observationally motivated range exists around aB = -1.6 +-0.2, thereby leading to a ballpark agreement between our estimates and observationally inferred field magnitudes of magnetic clouds (MCs) at L1.

BLACK HOLE MULTIPLETS AND SPONTANEOUS BREAKING OF LOCAL SUPERSYMMETRY,Recipes for Oscillon Longevity,True,"We classify states saturating a double or a single supersymmetric positivity bound of a four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetry. The massive four-dimensional double-bound states (Bogomolny states) are shown to form a light-like representation of ten-dimensional supersymmetry. The single-bound states form a massive representation (centrino multiplet) of a four-dimensional supersymmetry. The first component of the centrino multiplet is identified with extreme black holes with regular horizon which have one quarter of unbroken supersymmetry. The centrino multiplet includes a massive spin 3/2 state, the centrino, as a highest spin state. Existence of massive black hole supermultiplets may affect the massless sector of the theory. Assuming that gluino condensate is formed one can study its properties. The bilinear combination of covariantly constant Killing spinors supplies the possible form for a gluino condensate. The condensate has null properties, does not introduce a cosmological constant, and may lead to a spontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry. This suggests that centrino may provide a consistent super-Higgs mechanism.","Oscillons are localized states of scalar fields sustained by self interactions. They decay by emitting classical radiation, but their lifetimes are surprisingly large. We revisit the reasons behind their longevity, aiming at how the shape of the scalar potential $V(\phi)$ determines the lifetime. The corpuscular picture, where the oscillon is identified with a bound state of a large number of field quanta, allows to understand lifetimes of order of $10^3$ cycles in generic potentials. At the non-perturbative level, two properties of the scalar potential can substantially boost the lifetime: the flattening of $V(\phi)$ and the positivity of $V''(\phi)$. These properties are realized in the axion monodromy family of potentials. Moreover, this class of models connects continuously with an exceptional potential that admits eternal oscillon solutions. We check these results with a new fast-forward numerical method that allows to evolve in time to stages that cannot be otherwise simulated on a computer. The method exploits the attractor properties of the oscillons and fully accounts for nonlinearities. We find lifetimes up to $10^{14}$ cycles, but larger values are possible. Our work shows that oscillons formed in the early Universe can be stable on cosmological time scales and thus contribute to the abundance of (ultra)light scalar dark matter.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Baryonic Resonances from Baryon Decuplet-Meson Octet Interaction,Nucleon electroweak form factors: Analysis of their spectral functions,True,"We study $S$-wave interactions of the baryon decuplet with the octet of pseudoscalar mesons using the lowest order chiral Lagrangian. In the S=1 sector, we find an attractive interaction in the $\Delta K$ channel with I=1 while it is repulsive for I=2. The attractive interaction leads to a pole in the second Riemann sheet of the complex plane and is manifested as a large strength in the scattering amplitude close to the $\Delta K$ threshold, which is not the case for I=2. We use the unitarized coupled channel approach to also investigate all the other possible values of strangeness and isospin. We find two bound states in the SU(3) limit corresponding to the octet and decuplet representations. These are found to split into eight different trajectories in the complex plane when the SU(3) symmetry is broken gradually. Finally, we are able to provide a reasonable description for a good number of 4-star ${{3/2}}^-$ resonances listed by the Particle Data Group. In particular, the $\Xi(1820)$, the $\Lambda(1520)$ and the $\Sigma(1670)$ states are well reproduced.

For the isovector electromagnetic form factors, we recover the well known strong enhancement near threshold. For the isoscalar ones, we show that there is no visible enhancement due to the three--pion continuum. This justifies the use of vector meson poles only in dispersion--theoretical calculations.

Optimal Prediction of Time-to-Failure from Information Revealed by Damage,Determination of the local concentrations of Mn interstitials and antisite defects in GaMnAs,True,"We present a general prediction scheme of failure times based on updating continuously with time the probability for failure of the global system, conditioned on the information revealed on the pre-existing idiosyncratic realization of the system by the damage that has occurred until the present time. Its implementation on a simple prototype system of interacting elements with unknown random lifetimes undergoing irreversible damage until a global rupture occurs shows that the most probable predicted failure time (mode) may evolve non-monotonically with time as information is incorporated in the prediction scheme. In addition, both the mode, its standard deviation and, in fact, the full distribution of predicted failure times exhibit sensitive dependence on the realization of the system, similarly to ``chaos'' in spinglasses, providing a multi-dimensional dynamical explanation for the broad distribution of failure times observed in many empirical situations.",We present a method for the determination of the local concentrations of interstitial and substitutional Mn atoms and As antisite defects in GaMnAs.

Dynamical symmetry breaking in models with strong Yukawa interactions,Heavy Quarkonium Production at Collider Energies: Factorization and Evolution,True,"The primary aim of the thesis is to explore the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking by strong Yukawa dynamics. Technically, the symmetry is assumed to be broken by formation of symmetry-breaking parts of both the scalar and the fermion propagators, rather than by the scalar vacuum expectation values. The idea is first introduced on an example of a toy model with the underlying symmetry being an Abelian one and later applied to a realistic model of electroweak interaction. In addition, the thesis also deals with some more general, model-independent issues, applicable not only to the discussed model of strong Yukawa dynamics, but to a wider class of models with dynamical mass generation. First of these issues is the problem of fermion flavor mixing in the presence of fermion self-energies with a general momentum dependence. It is in particular shown how to define the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in such models and argued that it can come out in principle non-unitary. Second issue is the problem of calculating the gauge boson masses when the symmetry is broken by fermion self-energies. On top of deriving the formula for the gauge boson mass matrix we also find corrections to the related Pagels-Stokar formula.","We present a factorization formalism for inclusive production of heavy quarkonia of large transverse momentum, $p_T$ at collider energies, including both leading power (LP) and next-to-leading power (NLP) behavior in $p_T$.

Low rank Green's function representations applied to dynamical mean-field theory,First principles investigation of cubic RbGeO3 novel inorganic lead-free germanate perovskite material for optoelectronic and plasmonic applications,True,"Several recent works have introduced highly compact representations of single-particle Green's functions in the imaginary time and Matsubara frequency domains, as well as efficient interpolation grids used to recover the representations. In particular, the intermediate representation with sparse sampling and the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) make use of low-rank compression techniques to obtain optimal approximations with controllable accuracy. We consider the use of the DLR in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations, and in particular, show that the standard full Matsubara frequency grid can be replaced by the compact grid of DLR Matsubara frequency nodes. We test the performance of the method for a DMFT calculation of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ at temperature $50$K using a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and demonstrate that Matsubara frequency quantities can be represented on a grid of only $36$ nodes with no reduction in accuracy, or increase in the number of self-consistent iterations, despite the presence of significant Monte Carlo noise.","In this work, theoretical investigation of cubic Pm-3m phase RbGeO3 germanate perovskite using plain wave basis, density function theory (DFT) is conducted. DFT modelling calculations, clearly shows that this perovskite exhibits thermodynamic and dynamical stability in the cubic phase, identical to that of high pressure perovskite cubic SrGeO3. As from the computed phonon dispersions this system also exhibits anti-ferro distortive (AFD) instabilities, much similar as that observed in case of cubic SrGeO3 at ground state conditions. Hence, from this study we conclude that ideal cubic perovskite phase of RbGeO3 can be synthesized under identical experimental conditions, as that reported for SrGeO3 in the literature. Further, we report the fundamental opto-electronic properties of this material system from first principles DFT calculations, which are not yet reported and as per calculated properties this perovskite material is found to be well suited for opto-electronic and plasmonics based applications.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

A Renormalizable Theory of Quantum Gravity: Renormalization Proof of the Gauge Theory of Volume Preserving Diffeomorphisms,Implications of a frame dependent gravitational effective action for perturbations on the Robertson-Walker Metric,True,Inertial and gravitational mass or energy-momentum need not be the same for virtual quantum states. Separating their roles naturally leads to the gauge theory of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of an inner four-dimensional space. The gauge-fixed action and the path integral measure occurring in the generating functional for the quantum Green functions of the theory are shown to obey a BRST-type symmetry. The related Zinn-Justin-type equation restricting the corresponding quantum effective action is established. This equation limits the infinite parts of the quantum effective action to have the same form as the gauge-fixed Lagrangian of the theory proving its spacetime renormalizability. The inner space integrals occurring in the quantum effective action which are divergent due to the gauge group's infinite volume are shown to be regularizable in a way consistent with the symmetries of the theory demonstrating as a byproduct that viable quantum gauge field theories are not limited to finite-dimensional compact gauge groups as is commonly assumed.,"In earlier work we showed that a frame dependent effective action motivated by the postulates of three-space general coordinate invariance and Weyl scaling invariance exactly mimics a cosmological constant in Robertson-Walker (RW) spacetimes. Here we study the implications of this effective action for small fluctuations around a spatially flat RW background geometry. The equations for the conserving extension of the modified stress-energy tensor can be integrated in closed form, and involve only the metric perturbation $h_{00}$. Hence the equations for tensor and vector perturbations are unmodified, but there are Hubble scale additions to the scalar perturbation equations, which nonetheless admit no propagating wave solutions. Consequently, there are no modifications to standard gravitational wave propagation theory, but there may be observable implications for cosmology. We give a self-contained discussion, including an analysis of the restricted class of gauge transformations that act when a frame dependent effective action is present.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Charmed mesons and leptons from semileptonic decays at the LHC,Novel experimental probes of QCD in SIDIS and $e^+e^-$ annihilation,True,"We discuss production of charmed mesons as well as electrons/muons from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom mesons in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The cross section for inclusive production of $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ pairs is calculated in the framework of the $k_{\perp}$-factorization approach. Here, the KMR and Jung CCFM unintegrated gluon distribution functions are used. Theoretical uncertainties of the model related to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales as well as due to the quark mass are also discussed. The hadronization of charm and bottom quarks is included within the fragmentation functions technique. Inclusive differential distributions in transverse momentum of charmed mesons are presented and compared to recent results of the ALICE collaboration. Furthermore, we also consider production of different $D \bar D$ pairs in unique kinematics of forward rapidities of the LHCb experiment. Kinematical correlations in azimuthal angle $\varphi_{D\bar D}$ and invariant mass $M_{D \bar D}$ distributions are presented and compared to LHCb data. Furthermore, the semileptonic decays of charm and bottom mesons are done with the help of decay functions found by fitting recent semileptonic data obtained by the CLEO and BABAR collaborations. Inclusive differential distributions in transverse momentum of leptons for several kinematical regions are presented and compared to recent results of the ALICE and CMS collaborations.","Semi-inclusive deep inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) has been a very successful tool to investigate the partonic structure of the nucleon over the last decade. Compared to inclusive DIS, information about the quantum numbers of the struck quark can be inferred from the identity, distribution and polarization of the final state hadrons. Up to now, virtually all knowledge about the quark-gluon structure of the nucleon from SIDIS has been gained from distributions of independently observed scalar hadrons. However, given the amount of data current and future experiments at JLab, RHIC, KEK and the EIC will collect, new paradigms have to be explored to leverage the statistical power of the data. Similar to other felds in nuclear and particle physics, it is natural to move towards the exploration of more complex correlations in the observed fi nal state. This contribution will discuss recent results and future prospects of using di-hadron correlations and polarized hyperon probes to study QCD in SIDIS, pp and e+e- annihilation. Both of these probes exploit additional degrees of freedom in the final state, given by the relative momentum of the di-hadron pair and the hyperon polarization, respectively.

Scheme Transformations in the Vicinity of an Infrared Fixed Point,Large N corrections to the strong coupling behaviour of SU(N)/Z_N lattice gauge theories,True,We analyze the effect of scheme transformations in the vicinity of an exact or approximate infrared fixed point in an asymptotically free gauge theory with fermions. We show that there is far less freedom in carrying out such scheme transformations in this case than at an ultraviolet fixed point. We construct a transformation from the $\bar{MS}$ scheme to a scheme with a vanishing three-loop term in the $\beta$ function and use this to assess the scheme dependence of an infrared fixed point in SU($N$) theories with fermions. Implications for the anomalous dimension of the fermion bilinear operator are also discussed.,"We derive a formula for the large N behaviour of the expectation values of an arbitrary product of Wilson loops in the adjoint representation. We show the consequences of our formula for the study of the large N strong coupling behaviour of SU(N)/Z_N pure gauge theories, and theories with matter fields in the adjoint representation. This allows us to calculate large N corrections to the gluino condensate and meson propagators in the lattice version of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills.

Lie Superalgebra and Extended Topological Conformal Symmetry in Non-critical $W_{3}$ Strings,Measurement of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in pp and p-Pb collisions with ALICE,False,"We obtain a new free field realization of $N=2$ super $W_{3}$ algebra using the technique of quantum hamiltonian reduction. The construction is based on a particular choice of the simple root system of the affine Lie superalgebra $sl(3|2)^{(1)}$ associated with a non-standard $sl(2)$ embedding.

"Three-dimensional pattern formation, multiple homogeneous soft modes, and nonlinear dielectric electroconvection",Extensive numerical study and circuitry implementation of the Watt governor model,False,"Patterns forming spontaneously in extended, three-dimensional, dissipative systems are likely to excite several homogeneous soft modes ($\approx$ hydrodynamic modes) of the underlying physical system, much more than quasi one- and two-dimensional patterns are. The reason is the lack of damping boundaries. This paper compares two analytic techniques to derive the patten dynamics from hydrodynamics, which are usually equivalent but lead to different results when applied to multiple homogeneous soft modes. Dielectric electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals is introduced as a model for three-dimensional pattern formation. The 3D pattern dynamics including soft modes are derived. For slabs of large but finite thickness the description is reduced further to a two-dimensional one. It is argued that the range of validity of 2D descriptions is limited to a very small region above threshold. The transition from 2D to 3D pattern dynamics is discussed. Experimentally testable predictions for the stable range of ideal patterns and the electric Nusselt numbers are made. For most results analytic approximations in terms of material parameters are given.","In this work we carry out extensive numerical study of a Watt-centrifugal-governor system model, and we also implement an electronic circuit by analog computation to experimentally solve the model. Our numerical results show the existence of self-organized stable periodic structures (SPSs) on parameter-space of the largest Lyapunov exponent and isospikes of time series of the Watt governor system model. A peculiar hierarchical organization and period-adding bifurcation cascade of the SPSs are observed, and this self-organized cascade accumulates on a periodic boundary. It is also shown that the periods of these structures organize themselves obeying the solutions of Diophantine equations. In addition, an experimental setup is implemented by a circuitry analogy of mechanical systems using analog computing technique to characterize the robustness of our numerical results. After applying an active control of chaos in the experiment, the effect of intrinsic experimental noise was minimized such that, the experimental results are in astonishing well agreement with our numerical findings. We can also mention as another remarkable result, the application of analog computing technique to perform an experimental circuitry analysis in real mechanical problems.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

M-center in low-energy electron irradiated 4H-SiC,Thermodynamic and Dynamic Anomalies for Dumbbell Molecules Interacting with a Repulsive Ramp-Like Potential,False,"We report on the low-energy electron irradiated 4H-SiC material studied by means of deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and Laplace-DLTS. Electron irradiation has introduced the following deep level defects: EH1 and EH3 previously assigned to carbon interstitial-related defects, and M-center, a metastable defect also recently assigned to carbon interstitial defects. We propose that EH1 and EH3 are identical to M1 and M3 and assign them to C_i^(= ) (h) and C_i^(0 ) (h), respectively. Moreover, we provide direct evidence that Laplace-DLTS can be used as an excellent tool to distinguish otherwise identical DLTS signals associated with S1 (VSi) and EH1 (Ci).","Using collision driven discrete molecular dynamics (DMD), we investigate the thermodynamics and dynamics of systems of 500 dumbbell molecules interacting by a purely repulsive ramp-like discretized potential, consisting of $n$ steps of equal size. We compare the behavior of the two systems, with $n = 18$ and $n = 144$ steps. Each system exhibits both thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies, a density maximum and the translational and rotational mobilities show anomalous behavior. Starting with very dense systems and decreasing the density, both mobilities first increase, reache a maximum, then decrease, reache a minimum, and finally increase; this behavior is similar to the behavior of SPC/E water. The regions in the pressure-temperature plane of translational and rotational mobility anomalies depend strongly on $n$. The product of the translational diffusion coefficient and the orientational correlation time increases with temperature, in contrast with the behavior of most liquids.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Ansatz of Hans Bethe for a two-dimensional Bose gas,Large-scale spatio-temporal patterns in a ring of non-locally coupled oscillators with a repulsive coupling,False,"The method of q-oscillator lattices, proposed recently in [hep-th/0509181], provides the tool for a construction of various integrable models of quantum mechanics in 2+1 dimensional space-time. In contrast to any one dimensional quantum chain, its two dimensional generalizations -- quantum lattices -- admit different geometrical structures. In this paper we consider the q-oscillator model on a special lattice. The model may be interpreted as a two-dimensional Bose gas. The most remarkable feature of the model is that it allows the coordinate Bethe Ansatz: the p-particles' wave function is the sum of plane waves. Consistency conditions is the set of 2p equations for p one-particle wave vectors. These ""Bethe Ansatz"" equations are the main result of this paper.","Non-locally coupled oscillators with a phase lag exhibit various non-trivial spatio-temporal patterns such as the chimera states and the multi-twisted states. We numerically study large-scale spatio-temporal patterns in a ring of oscillators with a repulsive coupling with a phase delay parameter $\alpha$. We find that the multi-chimera state disappears when $\alpha$ exceeds a critical value. Analyzing the density of incoherent regions, we show that the transition is analogous to that of directed percolation with two absorbing states, but their critical behaviors are different. The multi-chimera state reappears when $\alpha$ is further increased, exhibiting non-trivial spatio-temporal patterns with a plateau in the density of incoherent regions. A transition from the multi-chimera to multi-twisted states follows at a larger value of $\alpha$, resulting in five collective phases in total.",Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems,"Exactly solvable and integrable systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that can be solved exactly through analytical methods or have properties that allow for integrability.

Lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector: a joint analysis from big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background,Lattice study on two-color QCD with six flavors of dynamical quarks,False,"We investigate constraints on Lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector from a joint analysis of big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background. The effect of Lorentz invariance violation during the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis changes the predicted helium-4 abundance, which influences the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background at the recombination epoch. In combination with the latest measurement of the primordial helium-4 abundance, the Planck 2015 data of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies give a strong constraint on the deformation parameter since adding the primordial helium measurement breaks the degeneracy between the deformation parameter and the physical dark matter density.","We study the dynamics of SU(2) gauge theory with NF=6 Dirac fermions by means of lattice simulation to investigate if they are appropriate to realization of electroweak symmetry breaking.

We show numerically that the Ising-like XXZ models on square and cubic lattices show a first-order phase transition at some critical magnetic field. We estimate the value of the critical field and the magnetization jump on the basis of the Maxwell construction. The magnetization jump in the Ising-limit is investigated by means of perturbation theory. Based on our numerical results, we briefly discuss the phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in the hard-core limit.","We study the phase ordering dynamics of a uniform Bose gas in two dimensions following a quench into the ordered phase. We explore the crossover between dissipative and conservative evolution by performing numerical simulations within the classical field methodology. Regardless of the dissipation strength, we find clear evidence for universal scaling, with dynamical critical exponent $z$ characterising the growth of the correlation length. In the dissipative limit we find growth consistent with the logarithmically corrected law $[t/\log(t/t_0)]^{1/z}$, and exponent $z=2$, in agreement with previous studies. Decreasing the dissipation towards the conservative limit, we find strong numerical evidence for the expected growth law $t^{1/z}$. However, we observe a smooth crossover in $z$ that converges to an anomalous value distinctly lower than $2$ at a small finite dissipation strength. We show that this lower exponent may be attributable to a power-law vortex mobility arising from vortex--sound interactions.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Formation of planetary debris discs around white dwarfs I: Tidal disruption of an extremely eccentric asteroid,Discovery of new X-ray sources near the unidentified gamma-ray source HESS J1841-055,False,"25%-50% of all white dwarfs (WDs) host observable and dynamically active remnant planetary systems based on the presence of close-in circumstellar dust and gas and photospheric metal pollution. Currently-accepted theoretical explanations for the origin of this matter include asteroids that survive the star's giant branch evolution at au-scale distances and are subsequently perturbed onto WD-grazing orbits following stellar mass loss. In this work we investigate the tidal disruption of these highly-eccentric (e > 0.98) asteroids as they approach and tidally disrupt around the WD. We analytically compute the disruption timescale and compare the result with fully self-consistent numerical simulations of rubble piles by using the N-body code PKDGRAV. We find that this timescale is highly dependent on the orbit's pericentre and largely independent of its semimajor axis. We establish that spherical asteroids readily break up and form highly eccentric collisionless rings, which do not accrete onto the WD without additional forces such as radiation or sublimation. This finding highlights the critical importance of such forces in the physics of WD planetary systems.","HESS J1841$-$055 is a diffuse unidentified gamma-ray source with the size of $\sim\,1.3^{\circ}\times\,1^{\circ}$. No conclusive counterpart in other wavelengths has so far detected. To search for X-rays responsible for the TeV emission, the Suzaku observations were conducted, which covered a half region of the HESS source. In the soft band (0.5-2.0 keV), we discovered a diffuse emission, Suzaku J1840.2$-$0552, with the size of $\sim10'$. Since its spectrum was fitted by an optically thin thermal plasma model, Suzaku J1840.2$-$0552 is likely to be a supernova remnant. We also discovered an extended source, Suzaku J1840.2$-$0544, in the hard band (2.0-8.0 keV) with an emission line at 6.1 keV. From the spectral feature and large interstellar absorption, this source is likely to be a cluster of galaxies behind the Galactic plane at the red-shift of $\sim$0.09. The other diffuse source spatially overlaps with the SNR candidate G26.6$-$0.2, which shows a non-thermal dominant spectrum. Since no other candidate is found in the hard X-ray band, we infer that these largely extended sources could be possible counterparts of HESS J1841$-$055.",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"Earth and planetary astrophysics focuses on interplanetary medium, planetary physics, planetary astrobiology, extrasolar planets, comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

Estimating the molecular gas mass of low-redshift galaxies from a combination of mid-infrared luminosity and optical properties,Spotting Radio Transients with the help of GPUs,False,"We present CO(J=1-0) and/or CO(J=2-1) spectroscopy for 31 galaxies selected from the ongoing MaNGA survey, obtained with multiple telescopes. This sample is combined with CO observations from the literature to study the correlation of the CO luminosities ($L_{\rm CO(1-0)}$) with the mid-infrared luminosities at 12 ($L_{12 \mu m}$) and 22 $\mu$m ($L_{\rm 22 \mu m}$), as well as the dependence of the residuals on a variety of galaxy properties. The correlation with $L_{\rm 12 \mu m}$ is tighter and more linear, but galaxies with relatively low stellar masses and blue colors fall significantly below the mean $L_{\rm CO(1-0)}-L_{\rm 12\mu m}$ relation. We propose a new estimator of the CO(1-0) luminosity (and thus the total molecular gas mass) that is a linear combination of three parameters: $L_{\rm 12 \mu m}$, $M_\ast$ and $g-r$. We show that, with a scatter of only 0.18 dex in log $(L_{\rm CO(1-0)})$, this estimator provides unbiased estimates for galaxies of different properties and types. An immediate application of this estimator to a compiled sample of galaxies with only CO(J=2-1) observations yields a distribution of the CO(J=2-1) to CO(J=1-0) luminosity ratios ($R21$) that agrees well with the distribution of real observations, in terms of both the median and the shape. Application of our estimator to the current MaNGA sample reveals a gas-poor population of galaxies that are predominantly early-type and show no correlation between molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratio and star formation rate, in contrast to gas-rich galaxies. We also provide alternative estimators with similar scatters, based on $r$ and/or $z$ band luminosities instead of $M_\ast$. These estimators serve as cheap and convenient $M_{\rm mol}$ proxies to be potentially applied to large samples of galaxies, thus allowing statistical studies of gas-related processes of galaxies.","Exploration of the time-domain radio sky has huge potential for advancing our knowledge of the dynamic universe. Past surveys have discovered large numbers of pulsars, rotating radio transients and other transient radio phenomena; however, they have typically relied upon off-line processing to cope with the high data and processing rate. This paradigm rules out the possibility of obtaining high-resolution base-band dumps of significant events or of performing immediate follow-up observations, limiting analysis power to what can be gleaned from detection data alone. To overcome this limitation, real-time processing and detection of transient radio events is required. By exploiting the significant computing power of modern graphics processing units (GPUs), we are developing a transient-detection pipeline that runs in real-time on data from the Parkes radio telescope.

The Stellar Kinematic Center and the True Galactic Nucleus of NGC253,The Cherenkov Telescope Array Performance in Divergent Mode,False,"We present the first sub-arcsecond resolution two-dimensional stellar kinematics and X-ray observations of the prototypical starburst galaxy NGC253 which define the position and nature of the galactic nucleus. We get an estimate of the stellar kinematic center location corresponding to an area of r~1.2"" centered 0.7"" southwest from the radio core (TH2). Newly processed Chandra data reveal a central hard X-ray source (X-1) lying 0.4"" southwest from the kinematic center. Very accurate alignment between radio, infrared and X-ray sources shows that TH2, the IR photometric center and X-1 are not associated with each other. As the kinematic center is consistent with TH2 and X-1, we consider the two as possible galactic nucleus candidates. Although TH2 is the strongest radio source in the nuclear region, it does not have any infrared, optical or X-ray counterparts. If the kinematic center is associated with this source, by analogy we suggest that the nucleus of NGC253 resembles our Galactic Center SgrA*. On the other hand, X-1 is a heavily absorbed object only detected at energies >2 keV. If X-1 is instead associated with the kinematic center, the nucleus of NGC253 is compatible with an obscured low luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a spatially resolved super star cluster (SSC) brightening up in X-rays most probably due to young supernovae or supernova remnants. If no SSC is associated with the kinematic center, we conclude that NGC253 is a galaxy in which a strong starburst and a weak AGN (either TH2 or X-1) coexist. Results from few other high resolution studies of nearby starburst galaxies indicate that the AGN in these systems, if present, is always in the low luminosity regime. This may indicate that the onset of nuclear activity in galaxies is closely related with the occurrence of star formation, and that we are witnessing the emergence or disappearance of an AGN.","Two of the Key Science Projects of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) consist in performing a deep survey of the Galactic and Extragalactic sky, providing an unbiased view of the Universe at energies above tens of GeV. To optimize the time spent to perform the Extragalactic survey, a so-called ""divergent mode"" of the CTA was proposed as an alternative observation strategy to the traditional parallel pointing in order to increase its instantaneous field of view. The search for transient VHE sources would also benefit from an extended field of view.

Globular cluster systems in nearby dwarf galaxies - II. Nuclear star clusters and their relation to massive Galactic globular clusters,COMAP Early Science: I. Overview,False,"(Abridged) Using luminosities and structural parameters of globular clusters (GCs) in the nuclear regions (nGCs) of low-mass dwarf galaxies from HST/ACS imaging we derive the present-day escape velocities (v_esc) of stellar ejecta to reach the cluster tidal radius and compare them with those of Galactic GCs with extended (hot) horizontal branches (EHBs-GCs). For EHB-GCs, we find a correlation between the present-day v_esc and their metallicity as well as (V-I)_0 colour. The similar v_esc, (V-I)_0 distribution of nGCs and EHB-GCs implies that nGCs could also have complex stellar populations. The v_esc-[Fe/H] relation could reflect the known relation of increasing stellar wind velocity with metallicity, which in turn could explain why more metal-poor clusters typically show more peculiarities in their stellar population than more metal-rich clusters of the same mass do. Thus the cluster v_esc can be used as parameter to describe the degree of self-enrichment. The nGCs populate the same Mv vs. rh region as EHB-GCs, although they do not reach the sizes of the largest EHB-GCs like wCen and NGC 2419. We argue that during accretion the rh of an nGC could increase due to significant mass loss in the cluster vicinity and the resulting drop in the external potential in the core once the dwarf galaxy dissolves. Our results support the scenario in which Galactic EHB-GCs have originated in the centres of pre-Galactic building blocks or dwarf galaxies that were later accreted by the Milky Way.","The CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) aims to use line intensity mapping of carbon monoxide (CO) to trace the distribution and global properties of galaxies over cosmic time, back to the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To validate the technologies and techniques needed for this goal, a Pathfinder instrument has been constructed and fielded. Sensitive to CO(1-0) emission from $z=2.4$-$3.4$ and a fainter contribution from CO(2-1) at $z=6$-8, the Pathfinder is surveying $12$ deg$^2$ in a 5-year observing campaign to detect the CO signal from $z\sim3$. Using data from the first 13 months of observing, we estimate $P_\mathrm{CO}(k) = -2.7 \pm 1.7 \times 10^4\mu\mathrm{K}^2 \mathrm{Mpc}^3$ on scales $k=0.051-0.62 \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ - the first direct 3D constraint on the clustering component of the CO(1-0) power spectrum. Based on these observations alone, we obtain a constraint on the amplitude of the clustering component (the squared mean CO line temperature-bias product) of $\langle Tb\rangle^2<49$ $\mu$K$^2$ - nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement on the previous best measurement. These constraints allow us to rule out two models from the literature. We forecast a detection of the power spectrum after 5 years with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) 9-17. Cross-correlation with an overlapping galaxy survey will yield a detection of the CO-galaxy power spectrum with S/N of 19. We are also conducting a 30 GHz survey of the Galactic plane and present a preliminary map.

Interacting spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates,Intrinsic and dislocation induced elastic behavior of solid helium,False,"The recent experimental realization of spin-orbit (SO) coupling for spin-1 ultracold atoms opens an interesting avenue for exploring SO-coupling-related physics in large-spin systems, which is generally unattainable in electronic materials. In this paper, we study the effects of interactions between atoms on the ground states and collective excitations of SO-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the presence of a spin-tensor potential. We find that ferromagnetic interaction between atoms can induce a stripe phase exhibiting in-phase or out-of-phase modulating patterns between spin-tensor and zero-spin-component density waves. We characterize the phase transitions between different phases using the spin-tensor density as well as the collective dipole motion of the BEC. We show that there exists a double maxon-roton structure in the Bogoliubov-excitation spectrum, attributed to the three band minima of the SO-coupled spin-1 BEC.","Recent experiments showed that the shear modulus of solid 4He stiffens in the same temperature range (below 200 mK) where mass decoupling and supersolidity have been inferred from torsional oscillator measurements. The two phenomena are clearly related and crystal defects, particularly dislocations, appear to be involved in both. We have studied the effects of annealing and the effects of applying large stresses on the elastic properties of solid 4He, using both acoustic resonances and direct low-frequency and low-amplitude measurements of the shear modulus. Both annealing and stressing affect the shear modulus, as expected if dislocations are responsible. However, it is the high temperature modulus which is affected; the low temperature behavior is unchanged and appears to reflect the intrinsic modulus of solid helium. We interpret this behavior in terms of dislocations which are pinned by isotopic 3He impurities at low temperatures and so have no effect on the shear modulus. At higher temperatures they become mobile and weaken the solid. Stressing the crystal at low temperatures appears to introduce new defects or additional pinning sites for the dislocation network but these effects can be reversed by heating the crystal above 500 mK. This is in contrast to dislocations produced during crystal growth, which are only annealed at temperatures close to melting.",Quantum Gases,"Quantum gases in condensed matter physics focuses on ultracold atomic and molecular gases, Bose-Einstein condensation, Feshbach resonances, spinor condensates, optical lattices, quantum simulation with cold atoms and molecules, and macroscopic interference phenomena."
Quasitriangularity of quantum groups at roots of 1,The omega-rho meson mass splitting and mixing from lattice QCD,False,"An important property of a Hopf algebra is its quasitriangularity and it is useful various applications. This property is investigated for quantum groups $sl_2$ at roots of 1. It is shown that different forms of the quantum group $sl_2$ at roots of 1 are either quasitriangular or have similar structure which will be called autoquasitriangularity. In the most interesting cases this property means that ""braiding automorphism"" is a combination of some Poisson transformation and an adjoint transformation with certain element of the tensor square of the algebra.","We compare flavour singlet and non-singlet vector mesons from first principles using lattice QCD. With N_f=2 flavours of light quark, this addresses the omega-rho mass difference. Using maximally twisted-mass lattice QCD, we are able for the first time to determine this mass difference precisely and we compare with experiment.

Correlated non-perturbative electron dynamics with quantum trajectories,Propagation of compressional elastic waves through a 1-D medium with contact nonlinearities,False,An approach to electron correlation effects in atoms that uses quantum trajectories is presented. A comparison with the exact quantum mechanical results for 1D Helium atom shows that the major features of the correlated ground state distribution and of the strong field ionization dynamics are reproduced with quantum trajectories. The intra-atomic resonant transitions are described accurately by a trajectory ensemble. The present approach reduces significantly the computational time and it can be used for both bound and ionizing electrons.,"Propagation of monochromatic elastic waves across cracks is investigated in 1D, both theoretically and numerically.

Specific viscosity of neutron-rich nuclear matter from a relaxation time approach,Directed flow of antiprotons in Au+Au collisions at AGS,False,"The specific viscosity of neutron-rich nuclear matter is studied from the relaxation time approach using an isospin- and momentum-dependent interaction and the nucleon-nucleon cross sections taken as those from the experimental data modified by the in-medium effective masses as used in the IBUU transport model calculations. The relaxation time of neutrons is larger while that of protons is smaller in neutron-rich nuclear matter compared with that in symmetric nuclear matter, and this leads to a larger specific viscosity in neutron-rich nuclear matter. In addition, the specific viscosity decreases with increasing temperature because of more frequent collisions and weaker Pauli blocking effect at higher temperatures. At lower temperatures the specific viscosity increases with increasing density due to the Pauli blocking effect, while at higher temperatures it slightly decreases with increasing density as a result of smaller in-medium effective masses at higher densities.",Directed flow of antiprotons is studied in Au+Au collisions at a beam momentum of 11.5A GeV/c.

A scheme for realizing continuously tunable spectrum in the visible light region based on monatomic carbon chains,Quantum Walk in Momentum Space with a Bose-Einstein Condensate,False,"We propose a scheme for realizing the continuously tunable spectrum based on monatomic carbon chains. By hybrid density functional calculations, we first show that the direct band gap of monatomic carbon chains change continuously from 1.58 to 3.8 eV as strain is applied from -5 to 10% to the chain, with separated Van Hove singularity peaks enhanced. To realize this tunability, a realistic stretching device is proposed by contacting the chain with graphene sheets, which can apply up to 9% elongation to the chain, yielding tunable light-emitting wavelengths from 345 to 561 nm.","We present a discrete-time, one-dimensional quantum walk based on the entanglement between the momentum of ultracold rubidium atoms (the walk space) and two internal atomic states (the ""coin"" degree of freedom). Our scheme is highly flexible and can provide a platform for a wide range of applications such as quantum search algorithms, the observation of topological phases, and the realization of walks with higher dimensionality.

Collisional heating of icy planetesimals. I. Catastrophic collisions,Discovering the most elusive radio relic in the sky: Diffuse Shock Acceleration caught in the act?,False,"Planetesimals in the primordial disc may have experienced a collisional cascade. If so, the comet nuclei later placed in the Kuiper belt, scattered disc, and Oort Cloud would primarily be fragments and collisional rubble piles from that cascade. However, the heating associated with the collisions cannot have been strong enough to remove the hypervolatiles that are trapped within more durable ices, because comet nuclei are rich in hypervolatiles. This places constraints on the diameter of the largest bodies allowed to participate in collisional cascades, and limits the primordial disc lifetime or population size. In this paper, the thermophysical code NIMBUS is used to study the thermal evolution of planetesimals before, during, and after catastrophic collisions. The loss of CO during segregation of $\mathrm{CO_2:CO}$ mixtures and during crystallisation of amorphous $\mathrm{H_2O}$ is calculated, as well as mobilisation and internal relocation of $\mathrm{CO_2}$. If an amorphous $\mathrm{H_2O}$ host existed, and was protected by a $\mathrm{CO_2:CO}$ heat sink, only diameter $D<20\,\mathrm{km}$ (inner disc) and $D<64\,\mathrm{km}$ (outer disc) bodies could have been involved in a collisional cascade. If $\mathrm{CO_2}$ was the only CO host, the critical diameters drop to $D<20$-$32\mathrm{km}$. Avoiding disruption of larger bodies requires a primordial disc lifetime of $<9\,\mathrm{Myr}$ at $15\,\mathrm{au}$ and $<50$-$70\,\mathrm{Myr}$ at $30\,\mathrm{au}$. Alternatively, if a $450\,\mathrm{Myr}$ disc lifetime is required to associate the primordial disc disruption with the Late Heavy Bombardment, the disc population size must have been 6-60 times below current estimates.","The origin of radio relics is usually explained via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) or re-acceleration of electrons at/from merger shocks in galaxy clusters. The case of acceleration is challenged by the low predicted efficiency of low-Mach number merger shocks, unable to explain the power observed in most radio relics. In this Letter we present the discovery of a new giant radio relic around the galaxy cluster Abell 2249 ($z=0.0838$) using LOFAR. It is special since it has the lowest surface brightness of all known radio relics. We study its radio and X-ray properties combinig LOFAR data with uGMRT, JVLA and XMM. This object has a total power of $L_{1.4\rm GHz}=4.1\pm 0.8 \times 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and integrated spectral index $\alpha = 1.15\pm 0.23$. We infer for this radio relic a lower bound on the magnetisation of $B\geq 0.4\, \mu$G, a shock Mach number of $\mathcal{M}\approx 3.79$, and a low acceleration efficiency consistent with DSA. This result suggests that a missing population of relics may become visible thanks to the unprecedented sensitivity of the new generation of radio telescopes.",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"Earth and planetary astrophysics focuses on interplanetary medium, planetary physics, planetary astrobiology, extrasolar planets, comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

Stromgren photometric survey in the Galactic anticenter direction,Development of a cosmic ray oriented trigger for the fluorescence telescope on EUSO-SPB2,False,"Aims. The main purpose is to map the radial variation of the stellar space density for the young stellar population in the Galactic anticenter direction in order to understand the structure and location of the Perseus spiral arm. Methods. A uvbyHbeta Stromgren photometric survey covering 16sqrdeg in the anticenter direction was carried out using the Wide Field Camera at the Isaac Newton Telescope. This is the natural photometric system for identifying young stars and obtaining accurate estimates of individual distances and ages. The calibration to the standard system was undertaken using open clusters. Results. We present a main catalog of 35974 stars with all Stromgren indexes and a more extended one with 96980 stars with partial data. The central 8sqrdeg have a limiting magnitude of V<17m, while the outer region reaches V<15.5m. These large samples will permit us to analyze the stellar surface density variation associated to the Perseus arm also to study the properties of the stellar component and the interstellar extinction in the anticenter direction.","The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2), in preparation, aims to make the first observations of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) from near space using optical techniques. EUSO-SPB2 will prototype instrumentation for future satellite-based missions, including the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) and K-EUSO.

The FT will consist of a Schmidt telescope, and a 6192 pixel ultraviolet camera with an integration time of 1.05 microseconds. The first step in the data acquisition process for the FT is a hardware level trigger in order to decide which data to record. In order to maximize the number of UHECR induced extensive air showers (EASs) which can be detected, a novel trigger algorithm has been developed based on the intricacies and limitations of the detector. The expected performance of the trigger has been characterized by simulations and, pending hardware verification, shows that EUSO-SPB2 is well positioned to attempt the first near-space observation of UHECRs via optical techniques.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Light-induced anomalous Hall effect in massless Dirac fermion systems and topological insulators with dissipation,One-Loop Fluctuation Entropy of Charge Inversion in DNA,False,"Employing the quantum Liouville equation with phenomenological dissipation, we investigate the transport properties of massless and massive Dirac fermion systems that mimics graphene and topological insulators, respectively. The massless Dirac fermion system does not show an intrinsic Hall effect, but it shows a Hall current under the presence of circularly-polarized laser fields as a nature of a optically-driven nonequilibrium state. Based on the microscopic analysis, we find that the light-induced Hall effect mainly originates from the imbalance of photocarrier distribution in momentum space although the emergent Floquet-Berry curvature also has a non-zero contribution. We further compute the Hall transport property of the massive Dirac fermion system with an intrinsic Hall effect in order to investigate the interplay of the intrinsic topological contribution and the extrinsic light-induced population contribution. As a result, we find that the contribution from the photocarrier population imbalance becomes significant in the strong field regime and it overcomes the intrinsic contribution. This finding clearly demonstrates that intrinsic transport properties of materials can be overwritten by external driving and may open a way to ultrafast optical-control of transport properties of materials.","Experiments have revealed correlation-driven behavior of DNA in charged solutions, including charge inversion and condensation. This paper presents calculations of a lattice-gas model of charge inversion for the adsorption of charged dimers on DNA. Each adsorption site is assumed to have either a vacancy or a positively-charged dimer attached with the dimer oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the double helix DNA chain. The entropy and charge distributions of these three species are calculated including the lowest order fluctuation corrections to mean-field theory. We find that the inclusion of the fluctuation terms has a significant effect on the entropy, primarily in the regime where the dimers are repelled from the DNA molecule and compete with the chemical potential in solution.",Optics,Optics in physics focuses on adaptive optics.

The Lefever-Lejeune nonlinear lattice: convergence dynamics and the structure of equilibrium states,"A Gibbs-like measure for single-time, multi-scale energy transfer in stochastic signals and Shell Model of turbulence",False,"We consider the Lefever-Lejeune nonlinear lattice, a spatially discrete propagation-inhibition model describing the growth of vegetation densities in dry-lands. We analytically identify parametric regimes distinguishing between decay (associated with spatial extinction of vegetation patches) and potentially non-trivial time-asymptotics. To gain insight on the convergence dynamics, a stability analysis of spatially uniform states is performed, revealing the existence of a threshold for the discretization parameter which depends on the lattice parameters, below which their destabilization occurs and spatially non-uniform equilibrium states may emerge. Direct numerical simulations justified that the analytical stability criteria and parametric thresholds effectively describe the above transition dynamics and revealed the rich structure of the equilibrium set. Connections with the continuous sibling Lefever-Lejeune partial differential equation are also discussed.","A Gibbs-like approach for simultaneous multi-scale correlation functions in random, time-dependent, multiplicative processes for the turbulent energy cascade is investigated. We study the optimal log-normal Gibbs-like distribution able to describe the subtle effects induced by non-trivial time dependency on both single-scale (structure functions) and multi-scale correlation functions. We provide analytical expression for the general multi-scale correlation functions in terms of the two-point correlations between multipliers and we show that the log-normal distribution is already accurate enough to reproduce quantitatively many of the observed behavior. The main result is that non-trivial time effects renormalize the Gibbs-like effective potential necessary to describe single-time statistics. We also present a generalization of this approach to more general, non log-normal, potential. In the latter case one obtains a formal expansion of both structure functions and multi-scale correlations in terms of cumulants of all orders.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Hypergraphs and City Street Networks,Data-Driven Equation Discovery of a Cloud Cover Parameterization,False,The map of a city's streets constitutes a particular case of spatial complex network. However a city is not limited to its topology: it is above all a geometrical object whose particularity is to organize into short and long axes called streets. In this article we present and discuss two algorithms aiming at recovering the notion of street from a graph representation of a city. Then we show that the length of the so-called streets scales logarithmically. This phenomenon leads to assume that a city is shaped into a logic of extension and division of space.,"A promising method for improving the representation of clouds in climate models, and hence climate projections, is to develop machine learning-based parameterizations using output from global storm-resolving models. While neural networks can achieve state-of-the-art performance within their training distribution, they can make unreliable predictions outside of it. Additionally, they often require post-hoc tools for interpretation. To avoid these limitations, we combine symbolic regression, sequential feature selection, and physical constraints in a hierarchical modeling framework. This framework allows us to discover new equations diagnosing cloud cover from coarse-grained variables of global storm-resolving model simulations. These analytical equations are interpretable by construction and easily transferable to other grids or climate models. Our best equation balances performance and complexity, achieving a performance comparable to that of neural networks ($R^2=0.94$) while remaining simple (with only 11 trainable parameters). It reproduces cloud cover distributions more accurately than the Xu-Randall scheme across all cloud regimes (Hellinger distances $<0.09$), and matches neural networks in condensate-rich regimes. When applied and fine-tuned to the ERA5 reanalysis, the equation exhibits superior transferability to new data compared to all other optimal cloud cover schemes. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of symbolic regression in discovering interpretable, physically-consistent, and nonlinear equations to parameterize cloud cover.",Physics and Society,"Physics and society focuses on structure, dynamics and collective behavior of societies and groups (human or otherwise).

Statistical measures of complexity for strongly interacting systems,Secure Communication using Compound Signal from Generalized Synchronizable Chaotic Systems,False,"In recent studies, new measures of complexity for nonlinear systems have been proposed based on probabilistic grounds, as the LMC measure (Phys. Lett. A {\bf 209} (1995) 321) or the SDL measure (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 59} (1999) 2). All these measures share an intuitive consideration: complexity seems to emerge in nature close to instability points, as for example the phase transition points characteristic of critical phenomena. Here we discuss these measures and their reliability for detecting complexity close to critical points in complex systems composed of many interacting units. Both a two-dimensional spatially extended problem (the 2D Ising model) and a $\infty$-dimensional (random graph) model (random Boolean networks) are analysed. It is shown that the LMC and the SDL measures can be easily generalized to extended systems but fails to detect real complexity.","By considering generalized synchronizable chaotic systems, the drive-auxiliary system variables are combined suitably using encryption key functions to obtain a compound chaotic signal.

We propose a guided self-assembly process to produce atomically precise arrays of single dopant atoms in lieu of lithographic patterning. We leverage the self-assembled c(4x2) structure formed on Br- and I-Si(100) and investigate molecular precursor adsorption into the generated array of single-dimer window (SDW) adsorption sites with density functional theory (DFT). The adsorption of several technologically relevant dopant precursors (PH$_3$, BCl$_3$, AlCl$_3$, GaCl$_3$) into SDWs formed with various resists (H, Cl, Br, I) are explored to identify the effects of steric interactions. PH$_3$ adsorbed without barrier on all resists studied, while BCl$_3$ exhibited the largest adsorption barrier, 0.34 eV, with an I resist. Dense arrays of AlCl$_3$ were found to form within experimentally realizable conditions demonstrating the potential for the proposed use of guided self-assembly for atomically precise fabrication of dopant-based devices.","A question that comes up repeatedly is how to combine the results of two experiments if all that is known is that one experiment had a n-sigma effect and another experiment had a m-sigma effect.

"Ultrafast Laser Ablation, Intrinsic Threshold, and Nanopatterning of Monolayer Molybdenum Disulfide",Earthquake Phase Association using a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model,False,"Laser direct writing is an attractive method for patterning 2D materials without contamination. Literature shows that the femtosecond ablation threshold of graphene across substrates varies by an order of magnitude. Some attribute it to the thermal coupling to the substrates, but it remains by and large an open question. For the first time the effect of substrates on femtosecond ablation of 2D materials is studied using MoS$_{2}$ as an example. We show unambiguously that femtosecond ablation of MoS$_{2}$ is an adiabatic process with negligible heat transfer to the substrates. The observed threshold variation is due to the etalon effect which was not identified before for the laser ablation of 2D materials. Subsequently, an intrinsic ablation threshold is proposed as a true threshold parameter for 2D materials. Additionally, we demonstrate for the first time femtosecond laser patterning of monolayer MoS$_{2}$ with sub-micron resolution and mm/s speed. Moreover, engineered substrates are shown to enhance the ablation efficiency, enabling patterning with low-power femtosecond oscillators. Finally, a zero-thickness approximation is introduced to predict the field enhancement with simple analytical expressions. Our work clarifies the role of substrates on ablation and firmly establishes femtosecond laser ablation as a viable route to pattern 2D materials.","Earthquake phase association algorithms aggregate picked seismic phases from a network of seismometers into individual earthquakes and play an important role in earthquake monitoring. Dense seismic networks and improved phase picking methods produce massive earthquake phase data sets, particularly for earthquake swarms and aftershocks occurring closely in time and space, making phase association a challenging problem. We present a new association method, the Gaussian Mixture Model Association (GaMMA), that combines the Gaussian mixture model for phase measurements (both time and amplitude), with earthquake location, origin time, and magnitude estimation. We treat earthquake phase association as an unsupervised clustering problem in a probabilistic framework, where each earthquake corresponds to a cluster of P and S phases with hyperbolic moveout of arrival times and a decay of amplitude with distance. We use a multivariate Gaussian distribution to model the collection of phase picks for an event, the mean of which is given by the predicted arrival time and amplitude from the causative event. We carry out the pick assignment for each earthquake and determine earthquake parameters (i.e., earthquake location, origin time, and magnitude) under the maximum likelihood criterion using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The GaMMA method does not require the typical association steps of other algorithms, such as grid-search or supervised training. The results on both synthetic test and the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence show that GaMMA effectively associates phases from a temporally and spatially dense earthquake sequence while producing useful estimates of earthquake location and magnitude.",Applied Physics,"Applied physics focuses on applications of physics to new technology, including electronic devices, optics, photonics, microwaves, spintronics, advanced materials, metamaterials, nanotechnology, and energy sciences."
On Liquid Viscosity Effects on Droplet Splash and Receding Breakup on a Smooth Solid Surface at Atmospheric Pressure,Effect of dispersity of particle length on the electrical conductivity of the two-dimensional systems,False,"Experimental and modelling study is presented for the effect of a wide range of liquid viscosities on the droplet impact on a smooth solid surface at atmospheric pressure. A non-monotonic variation of threshold between droplet deposition and splash was observed experimentally. Specifically, the critical Weber number separating deposition from splashing decreases and then increases with increasing the Ohnesorge number. The observations of splash in low viscosity region and receding breakup in high viscosity region were analyzed qualitatively from the perspectives of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and Rayleigh-Taylor instability, respectively. Based on instability analysis for the viscosityinduced nonmonotonicity, a new semi-empirical correlation of droplet splashing thresholds is proposed by fitting experimental results from previous and present data and shows better performance than previous correlation formulas.","By means of computer simulation, we examined effect of dispersity of filler length on electrical conductivity of two-dimensional (2D) composites with rod-like fillers.

Generation of finite wave trains in excitable media,Hysteretic transition of coarse-grained power grid model on small-world network,False,"Spatiotemporal control of excitable media is of paramount importance in the development of new applications, ranging from biology to physics. To this end we identify and describe a qualitative property of excitable media that enables us to generate a sequence of traveling pulses of any desired length, using a one-time initial stimulus. The wave trains are produced by a transient pacemaker generated by a one-time suitably tailored spatially localized finite amplitude stimulus, and belong to a family of fast pulse trains. A second family, of slow pulse trains, is also present. The latter are created through a clumping instability of a traveling wave state (in an excitable regime) and are inaccessible to single localized stimuli of the type we use. The results indicate that the presence of a large multiplicity of stable, accessible, multi-pulse states is a general property of simple models of excitable media.","We study synchronous phenomena of a coarse-grained power grid model, the swing equation, on small-world networks. We show that its steady state, which stands for the normal operation of the power systems, can be realized even if the phases are disordered. In addition, we prove the linear stability of steady state with small-different phases between the adjacent oscillators. On the other hand, a trigger of instantaneous power failure, which is described by the hysteretic transition, might disappear on an appropriate small-world network. This result suggests that the small-world connection would potentially prevent the massive blackouts.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Critical points of the cosmic velocity field and the uncertainties in the value of the Hubble constant,The Structure and Kinematics of the Circum-Galactic Medium from Far-UV Spectra of z~2-3 Galaxies,False,"The existence of critical points for the peculiar velocity field is a natural feature of the correlated vector field. These points appear at the junctions of velocity domains with different orientations of their averaged velocity vectors. Since peculiar velocities are the important cause of the scatter in the Hubble expansion rate, we propose that a more precise determination of the Hubble constant can be made by restricting analysis to a subsample of observational data containing only the zones around the critical points of the peculiar velocity field, associated with voids and saddle points. On large-scales the critical points, where the first derivative of the gravitational potential vanishes, can easily be identified using the density field and classified by the behavior of the Hessian of the gravitational potential. We use high-resolution N-body simulations to show that these regions are stable in time and hence are excellent tracers of the initial conditions. Furthermore, we show that the variance of the Hubble flow can be substantially minimized by restricting observations to the subsample of such regions of vanishing velocity instead of aiming at increasing the statistics by averaging indiscriminately using the full data sets, as is the common approach.","We present new results on the kinematics and spatial distribution of metal-enriched gas within 125 kpc (physical) of Lyman Break galaxies at redshifts z~2-3. In particular, we demonstrate how rest-UV galaxy spectra can be used to obtain key spatial and spectral information more efficiently than possible with QSO sightlines. After recalibrating the measurement of galaxy systemic redshifts from their UV spectra, we investigate the kinematics of galaxy-scale outflows via the strong interstellar (IS) absorption and Lya emission lines (when present), as well as their dependence on other physical properties of the galaxies. We construct a sample of 512 close (1-15 arcsec) angular pairs of z~2-3 LBGs in which the spectra background galaxies probe the circumgalactic gas surrrounding those in the foreground. The close pairs, together with spectra of the foreground galaxies themselves, sample galactocentric impact parameters b=0-125 kpc (physical) at <z>=2.2. The ensemble provides a spatial map of cool gas as a function of galactocentric distance for a well-characterized population of galaxies. We propose a simple model that simultaneously matches the kinematics, depth, and profile shape of IS absorption and Lya emission lines, as well as the observed variation of absorption line strength (of HI, CII, CIV, SiII, SiIV) versus galactocentric impact parameter. We discuss the results of the observations in the context of ""cold accretion"", in which cool gas accretes via filamentary streams directly onto the central regions of galaxies.

Gauge transformation and symmetries of the commutative multi-component BKP hierarchy,Breather initial profiles in chains of weakly coupled anharmonic oscillators,False,"In this paper, we defined a new multi-component BKP hierarchy which takes values in a commutative subalgebra of $gl(N,\mathbb C)$. After this, we give the gauge transformation of this commutative multi-component BKP (CMBKP) hierarchy. Meanwhile we construct a new constrained CMBKP hierarchy which contains some new integrable systems including coupled KdV equations under a certain reduction. After this, the quantum torus symmetry and quantum torus constraint on the tau function of the commutative multi-component BKP hierarchy will be constructed.","A systematic correlation between the initial profile of discrete breathers and their frequency is described.

Longitudinal Asymmetry and its Measurable Effects in Pb-Pb Collisions at 2.76 TeV,Bifurcations in Boltzmann-Langevin One Body dynamics for fermionic systems,False,"Collisions of identical nuclei at finite impact parameter have an unequal number of participating nucleons from each nucleus due to fluctuations. The event-by-event fluctuations have been estimated by measuring the difference of energy in the zero-degree calorimeters on either side of interaction vertex. The fluctuations affect the global variables such as the rapidity distributions, and the effect has been correlated with a measure of these fluctuations.","We investigate the occurrence of bifurcations in the dynamical trajectories depicting central nuclear collisions at Fermi energies. The quantitative description of the reaction dynamics is obtained within a new transport model, based on the solution of the Boltzmann-Langevin equation in three dimensions, with a broad applicability for dissipative fermionic dynamics. Dilute systems formed in central collisions are shown to fluctuate between two energetically favourable mechanisms: reverting to a compact shape or rather disintegrating into several fragments. The latter result can be connected to the recent observation of bimodal distributions for quantities characterising fragmentation processes and may suggest new investigations.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Approximating the largest eigenvalue of network adjacency matrices,Surface exciton polaritons: a promising mechanism for sensing applications,False,"The largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a network plays an important role in several network processes (e.g., synchronization of oscillators, percolation on directed networks, linear stability of equilibria of network coupled systems, etc.). In this paper we develop approximations to the largest eigenvalue of adjacency matrices and discuss the relationships between these approximations. Numerical experiments on simulated networks are used to test our results.","The possibility of constructing a surface exciton polariton (SEP) based sensor at room temperature is explored. The proposed SEP sensor is based on the Kretschmann-Raether configuration of conventional surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor, where the metal thin film was replaced by the J-aggregate cyanine dye film. The excitation of SEP results in a strong electric field at the interface of TDBC and analyte, and exponentially decaying into the analyte, which is sensitive to the refractive index variations of analyte. The sensitivity of 118.1818 $^\circ/\text{RIU}$ (140.4286 $^\circ/\text{RIU}$) was achieved for the proposed SEP sensor within the refractive index range 1.0-1.001 (1.33-1.36) of gaseous analyte (aqueous solutions), which is about 2 (3.5) times higher than that of conventional gold-based SPR sensor.

Detecting planetary mass companions near the water frost-line using JWST interferometry,Priority Questions for Jupiter System Science in the 2020s and Opportunities for Europa Clipper,False,"JWST promises to be the most versatile infrared observatory for the next two decades. The Near Infrared and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument, when used in the Aperture Masking Interferometry (AMI) mode, will provide an unparalleled combination of angular resolution and sensitivity compared to any existing observatory at mid-infrared wavelengths. Using simulated observations in conjunction with evolutionary models, we present the capability of this mode to image planetary mass companions around nearby stars at small orbital separations near the circumstellar water frost-line for members of the young, kinematic moving groups Beta Pictoris, TW Hydrae, as well as the Taurus-Auriga association. We show that for appropriately chosen stars, JWST/NIRISS operating in the AMI mode can image sub-Jupiter companions near the water frost-lines with ~68% confidence. Among these, M-type stars are the most promising. We also show that this JWST mode will improve the minimum inner working angle by as much as ~50% in most cases when compared to the survey results from the best ground-based exoplanet direct imaging facilities (e.g. VLT/SPHERE). We also discuss how the NIRISS/AMI mode will be especially powerful for the mid-infrared characterization of the numerous exoplanets expected to be revealed by Gaia. When combined with dynamical masses from Gaia, such measurements will provide a much more robust characterization of the initial entropies of these young planets, thereby placing powerful constraints on their early thermal histories.","This whitepaper identifies important science questions that can be answered through exploration of the Jupiter System, with emphasis on the questions that can be addressed by the Europa Clipper Mission.

Electron scattering on microscopic corrugations in graphene,GdBO$_3$ and YBO$_3$ Nanocrystals under Compression,False,"We discuss various scattering mechanisms for Dirac fermions in single-layer graphene. It is shown that scattering on a short-range potential (due to, for example, neutral impurities) is mostly irrelevant for electronic quality of graphene, which is likely to be controlled by charged impurities and ripples (microscopic corrugations of a graphene sheet). The latter are an inherent feature of graphene due to its two-dimensional nature and can also be an important factor in defining the electron mean free path. We show that certain types of ripples create a long-range scattering potential, similar to Coulomb scatterers, and result in charge-carrier mobility practically independent on carrier concentration, in agreement with experimental observations.","High-pressure X-ray diffraction studies on nanocrystals of the pseudo-vaterite-type borates GdBO$_3$ and YBO$_3$ are herein reported up to 17.4(2) and 13.4(2) GPa respectively. The subsequent determination of the room-temperature pressure-volume equations of state is presented and discussed in the context of contemporary publications which contradict the findings of this work. In particular, the isothermal bulk moduli of GdBO$_3$ and YBO$_3$ are found to be 170(13) and 163(13) GPa respectively, almost 50% smaller than recent findings. Our experimental results provide an accurate revision of the high-pressure compressibility behaviour of GdBO$_3$ and YBO$_3$ which is consistent with the known systematics in isomorphic borates and previous ab initio calculations.

Measuring the phase velocity of twisted wavefronts,Memory and entropy,False,"Traditionally one defines the speed of a wave as a property of the medium. Recent studies in photonics have challenged this idea, indicating that spatial shaping of the optical wavefront has can alter the arrival time of single photons when compared to an entangled reference photon. However, relying only on time of flight measurements leads to ambiguity in the measurement. Unlike photonics, one can directly measure the phase and intensity of sound, permitting unambiguous measurements. We developed a bespoke 28-element ultrasonic phased array transducer to generate short pulses that carrying orbital angular momentum. Through spatial mapping, we observed pulse modulation that indicates a localised change in phase velocity by over 10 m/s. We present a geometrical argument for this effect, proposing that the phase velocity varies to compensate for the effective path length increase arising from spatial wavefront shaping. We expect that this pulse dispersion is a general effect for any spatially shaped wavefront and that it could be utilised to manipulate readings from pulse based sensor technologies such as SONAR, medical ultrasound, and underwater communication systems.","I study the physical nature of traces (or memories). Surprisingly, (i) systems separation with (ii) temperature differences and (iii) long thermalization times, are sufficient conditions to produce macroscopic traces.

Experiment and theory: the case of the Doppler effect for photons,An Introduction to Control of Chaos for Quasi-Integrable Hamiltonian Systems,False,"In 1907, Einstein suggested an experiment with flying atoms for corroborating time dilation. In that paper, the flying atom was conceived as a flying clock: the reference to the Doppler effect was only indirect (the experiments by Stark to the first order of $v/c$). In 1922, Schr\""odinger showed that the emission of a light quantum by a (flying) atom is regulated by the conservation laws of energy and linear momentum. Therefore, the Doppler effect for photons is the consequence of the energy and momentum exchange between the atom and the photon: a central role is played by the quantum energy jump $\Delta E$ of the transition (a relativistic invariant). The first realization of the experiment devised by Einstein is due to Ives and Stilwell (1938). Since then till nowadays experiments of this kind have been repeated in search of better precision and/or a deviation from the predictions of special relativity. The striking feature is that all the papers dealing with these experiments completely neglect Schr\""odinger's dynamical treatment. The origins of this omission are of different kind: pragmatic (agreement between formulas, wherever coming from, and experiments), historical (deep rooting of the wave theory of light) and epistemological (neglect of basic epistemological rules).","Quasi-integrable Hamiltonian systems are of great interest in many research fields of physics and mathematics. In these systems, the phase space has regular and chaotic trajectories. These trajectories depend in part on the magnitude of perturbation that breaks the integrability of the system. The value of the critical perturbation responsible for this transition is a key element in the control of chaos . In this paper, we explore a procedure for the control in quasi-integrable Hamiltonian systems via canonical map. Initially, we present the basic tools for this study: Hamiltonian map, linearization of the map and Chirikov criterion. Subsequently, we investigated the behavior of a wave-particle interaction front perturbation. Finally, we confront with a numerical analytical approach (iteration of the map) results, showing a good agreement.",History and Philosophy of Physics,"History and philosophy of physics focuses on history and philosophy of all branches of physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, including appreciations of physicists."
"Intermittency, chaos and singular fluctuations in the mixed Obukhov-Novikov shell model of turbulence",Exact traveling wave solutions of 1D parabolic-parabolic models of chemotaxis,False,"The multiscaling properties of the mixed Obukhov-Novikov shell model of turbulence are investigated numerically and compared with those of the complex GOY model, mostly studied in the recent years. Two types of generic singular fluctuations are identified~: first, self-similar solutions propagating from large to small scales and building up intermittency, second, complex time singularities inhibiting the cascade and promoting chaos. A simple and robust method is proposed to track these objects. It is shown that the scaling exponent of self-similar solutions selected by the dynamics is compatible with large order statistics whenever it departs enough from the Kolmogorov value. Complex time singularities on the other hand get trapped on the last shells, when the proportion of Novikov interactions exceeds a critical value which is argued to mark the boundary between chaotic and regular dynamics in the limit of infinite Reynolds number.",In this paper we consider three different 1D parabolic-parabolic systems of chemotaxis.

Recent Advances in Two-Dimensional Metal Monochalcogenides,Exciton-exciton interaction beyond the hydrogenic picture in a MoSe$_2$ monolayer in the strong light-matter coupling regime,False,"The family of emerging low-symmetry and structural in-plane anisotropic 2D materials have been expanding rapidly in recent years. As an important emerging anisotropic 2D material, the black phosphorene (BP) analog group IVA-VI metal monochalcogenides (MMCs) have been surged recently due to their distinctive crystalline symmetries, exotic in-plane anisotropic electronic and optical response, earth abundant and environmentally friendly characteristics. In this article, we review the recent research advancements in the field of anisotropic 2D MMCs. At first, the unique wavy crystal structures together with the optical and electronic properties of such materials are discussed. The review continues with the various methods adopted for the synthesis of layered MMCs including micromechanical and liquid phase exfoliation as well as physical vapor deposition. The last part of the article focuses on the application of the structural anisotropic response of 2D MMCs in field effect transistors, photovoltaic cells nonlinear optics and valleytronic devices. Besides presenting the significant research in the field of this emerging class of 2D materials, this review also delineates the existing limitations and discusses emerging possibilities and future prospects.","In transition metal dichalcogenides layers of atomic scale thickness, the electron-hole Coulomb interaction potential is strongly influenced by the sharp discontinuity of the dielectric function across the layer plane. This feature results in peculiar non-hydrogenic excitonic states, in which exciton-mediated optical nonlinearities are predicted to be enhanced as compared to their hydrogenic counterpart. To demonstrate this enhancement, we performed optical transmission spectroscopy of a MoSe$_2$ monolayer placed in the strong coupling regime with the mode of an optical microcavity, and analyzed the results quantitatively with a nonlinear input-output theory. We find an enhancement of both the exciton-exciton interaction and of the excitonic fermionic saturation with respect to realistic values expected in the hydrogenic picture. Such results demonstrate that unconventional excitons in MoSe$_2$ are highly favourable for the implementation of large exciton-mediated optical nonlinearities, potentially working up to room temperature.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Resonant metallic states in driven quasiperiodic lattices,Effects of self-consistency and plasmon-pole models on GW calculations for closed-shell molecules,False,"We consider a quasiperiodic Aubry-Andre (AA) model and add a weak time-periodic and spatially quasiperiodic perturbation. The undriven AA model is chosen to be well in the insulating regime. The spatial quasiperiodic perturbation extends the model into two dimensions in reciprocal space. For a spatial resonance which reduces the reciprocal space dynamics to an effective one-dimensional two-leg ladder case, the ac perturbation resonantly couples certain groups of localized eigenstates of the undriven AA model and turns them into extended metallic ones. Slight detuning of the spatial and temporal frequencies off resonance returns these states into localized ones. We analyze the details of the resonant metallic eigenstates using Floquet representations. In particular, we find that their size grows linearly with the system size. Initial wave packets overlap with resonant metallic eigenstates and lead to ballistic spreading.","We present theoretical calculations of quasiparticle energies in closed-shell molecules using the GW method. We compare three different approaches: a full-frequency $G_0W_0$ (FF-$G_0W_0$) method with density functional theory (DFT-PBE) used as a starting mean field; a full-frequency $GW_0$ (FF-$GW_0$) method where the interacting Green's function is approximated by replacing the DFT energies with self-consistent quasiparticle energies or Hartree-Fock energies; and a $G_0W_0$ method with a Hybertsen-Louie generalized plasmon-pole model (HL GPP-$G_0W_0$). While the latter two methods lead to good agreement with experimental ionization potentials and electron affinities for methane, ozone, and beryllium oxide molecules, FF-$G_0W_0$ results can differ by more than one electron volt from experiment. We trace this failure of the FF-$G_0W_0$ method to the occurrence of incorrect self-energy poles describing shake-up processes in the vicinity of the quasiparticle energies.",Disordered Systems and Neural Networks,"Disordered systems and neural networks in condensed matter physics focuses on physical systems that are inherently non-crystalline or lack long-range order.

Evidence of Three Mechanisms Explaining the Radius Anomaly of Hot Jupiters,MEPSA: a flexible peak search algorithm designed for uniformly spaced time series,False,"The radii of hot Jupiters are still not fully understood and all of the proposed explanations are based on the idea that these close-in giant planets possess hot interiors. We approach the radius anomaly problem by adopting a statistical approach. We infer the internal luminosity for the sample of hot Jupiters, study its effect on the interior structure, and put constraints on which mechanism is the dominant one. We develop a flexible and robust hierarchical Bayesian model that couples the interior structure of exoplanets to their observed properties. We apply the model to 314 hot Jupiters and infer the internal luminosity distribution for each planet and study at the population level ({\it i}) the mass-luminosity-radius distribution and as a function of equilibrium temperature the distributions of the ({\it ii}) heating efficiency, ({\it iii}) internal temperature, and the ({\it iv}) pressure of the radiative-convective-boundary (RCB). We find that hot Jupiters tend to have high internal luminosity leading to hot interiors. This has important consequences on the cooling rate and we find that the RCB is located at low pressures. Assuming that the ultimate source of the extra heating is the irradiation from the host star, we illustrate that the heating efficiency follows a Gaussian distribution, in agreement with previous results. We discuss our findings in the context of the proposed heating mechanisms and illustrate that ohmic dissipation, advection of potential temperature, and thermal tides are in agreement with certain trends inferred from our analysis and thus all three models can explain aspects of the observations. We provide new insights on the interior structure of hot Jupiters and show that with our current knowledge it is still challenging to firmly identify the universal mechanism driving the inflated radii.","We present a novel algorithm aimed at identifying peaks within a uniformly sampled time series affected by uncorrelated Gaussian noise. The algorithm, called ""MEPSA"" (multiple excess peak search algorithm), essentially scans the time series at different timescales by comparing a given peak candidate with a variable number of adjacent bins. While this has originally been conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst light (GRB) curves, its usage can be readily extended to other astrophysical transient phenomena, whose activity is recorded through different surveys. We tested and validated it through simulated featureless profiles as well as simulated GRB time profiles. We showcase the algorithm's potential by comparing with the popular algorithm by Li and Fenimore, that is frequently adopted in the literature. Thanks to its high flexibility, the mask of excess patterns used by MEPSA can be tailored and optimised to the kind of data to be analysed without modifying the code.

Tunneling into fuzzball states,The chicken or the egg; or Who ordered the chiral phase transition?,False,"String theory suggests that black hole microstates are quantum, horizon sized `fuzzballs', rather than smooth geometries with horizon. Radiation from fuzzballs can carry information and does not lead to information loss. But if we let a shell of matter collapse then it creates a horizon, and it seems that subsequent radiation will lead to information loss. We argue that the resolution to this problem is that the shell can tunnel to the fuzzball configurations. The amplitude for tunneling is small because we are relating two macroscopically different configurations, but the number of states that we can tunnel to, given through the Bekenstein entropy, is very large. These small and large numbers can cancel each other, making it possible for the shell to tunnel into fuzzball states before a significant amount of radiation has been emitted. This offers a way to resolve the information paradox.","We draw an analogy between the deconfining transition in the 2+1 dimensional Georgi-Glashow model and the chiral phase transition in 3+1 dimensional QCD. Based on the detailed analysis of the former (hep-th/0010201) we suggest that the chiral symmetry restoration in QCD at high temperature is driven by the thermal ensemble of baryons and anti-baryons. The chiral symmetry is restored when roughly half of the volume is occupied by the baryons. Surprisingly enough, even though baryons are rather heavy, a crude estimate for the critical temperature gives $T_c=180$ Mev. In this scenario the binding of the instantons is not the cause but rather a consequence of the chiral symmetry restoration.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Heavy quark fragmentation functions at next-to-leading perturbative QCD,Orbifold resolutions with general profile,False,"It is well-known that the dominant mechanism to produce hadronic bound states with large transverse momentum is fragmentation. This mechanism is described by the fragmentation functions (FFs) which are the universal and process-independent functions. Here, we review the perturbative FFs formalism as an appropriate tool for studying these hadronization processes and detail the extension of this formalism at next-to-leading order (NLO). Using the Suzuki's model, we calculate the perturbative QCD FF for a heavy quark to fragment into a S-wave heavy meson at NLO. As an example, we study the LO and NLO FFs for a charm quark to split into the S-wave $D$-meson and compare our analytic results both with experimental data and well-known phenomenological models.","A very general class of resolved versions of the C/Z_N, T^2/Z_N and S^1/Z_2 orbifolds is considered and the free theory of 6D chiral fermions studied on it. As the orbifold limit is taken, localized 4D chiral massless fermions are seen to arise at the fixed points. Their number, location and chirality is found to be independent on the detailed profile of the resolving space and to agree with the result of hep-th/0409229, in which a particular resolution was employed. As a consistency check of the resolution procedure, the massive equation is numerically studied.

Resolving the spurious-state problem in the Dirac equation with finite difference method,Properties and significance of the surface dipole mode,False,"To solve the Dirac equation with the finite difference method, one has to face up to the spurious-state problem due to the fermion doubling problem when using the conventional central difference formula to calculate the first-order derivative on the equal interval lattices. This problem is resolved by replacing the central difference formula with the asymmetric difference formula, i.e., the backward or forward difference formula. To guarantee the hermitian of the Hamiltonian matrix, the backward and forward difference formula should be used alternatively according to the parity of the wavefunction. This provides a simple and efficient numerical prescription to solve various relativistic problems in the microscopic world.","A strong isoscalar dipole resonance is known to be excited in a variety of nuclei, including isospin symmetric ones, at approximately 6-7 MeV. A series of theoretical studies and accumulating experimental evidence support an interpretation of the above dipole resonance as an elementary surface vibration. Obviously, such a mode is potentially as interesting as any collective excitation for a variety of reasons. In addition, though, it is found to account for the observed isoscalar segment of pygmy dipole strength.

Quantitative Method for the Optimal Subtraction of Continuum Emission from Narrow-band Images : Skewness Transition Analysis,Variability in Quasar Broad Absorption Line Outflows I. Trends in the Short-Term versus Long-Term Data,False,"We present an objective method to remove the stellar continuum emission from narrow-band images to derive emission-line images. The method is based on the skewness of the pixel histogram of the residual images. Specifically, we exploit a transition in the skewness of the signal in the continuum-subtracted image, which appears when the image changes from being under-subtracted to over-subtracted. Tests on one-dimensional artificial images demonstrate that the transition identifies the optimal scaling factor {\mu} to be used on the broad-band image IB in order to produce the optimal line-emission image IE, i.e., IE =IN - {\mu} IB, with IN the original (un-subtracted) narrow-band image. The advantage of this method is that it uses all information-bearing pixels in the final image, and not just a sub-set of those pixels (the latter being common in many traditional approaches to stellar continuum removal from narrow-band images). We apply our method to actual images, both from ground-based and space facilities, in particular to WFPC2 and ACS images from the Hubble Space Telescope, and we show that it is successful irrespective of the nature of the sources (point-like or extended). We also discuss the impact on the accuracy of the method of non-optimal images, such as those containing saturated sources or non-uniform background, and present `workarounds' for those problems.","Broad absorption lines (BALs) in quasar spectra identify high velocity outflows that likely exist in all quasars and could play a major role in feedback to galaxy evolution. The variability of BALs can help us understand the structure, evolution, and basic physical properties of the outflows. Here we report on our first results from an ongoing BAL monitoring campaign of a sample of 24 luminous quasars at redshifts 1.2<z<2.9, focusing on C IV 1549 BAL variability in two different time intervals: 4 to 9 months (short-term) and 3.8 to 7.7 years (long-term) in the quasar rest-frame. We find that 39% (7/18) of the quasars varied in the short-term, whereas 65% (15/23) varied in the long-term, with a larger typical change in strength in the long-term data. The variability occurs typically in only portions of the BAL troughs. The components at higher outflow velocities are more likely to vary than those at lower velocities, and weaker BALs are more likely to vary than stronger BALs. The fractional change in BAL strength correlates inversely with the strength of the BAL feature, but does not correlate with the outflow velocity. Both the short-term and long-term data indicate the same trends. The observed behavior is most readily understood as a result of the movement of clouds across the continuum source. If the crossing speeds do not exceed the local Keplerian velocity, then the observed short-term variations imply that the absorbers are <6 pc from the central quasar.",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"Instrumentation and methods for astrophysics focuses on detector and telescope design, experiment proposals.

We estimated atmospheric parameters for all stellar remnants based on the Gaia parallaxes and photometry. The high precision and completeness of the Gaia astrometry allowed us to search for wide binary companions. We re-identified all known binaries where both components have accurate DR2 astrometry, and established the binarity of one of the nine newly identified white dwarfs. No new companions were found to previously known 20 pc white dwarfs. Finally, we estimated the local white dwarf space-density to be $(4.49\pm0.38)\times10^{-3}$ pc$^{-3}$, having given careful consideration to the distance-dependent Gaia completeness, which misses known objects at short distances, but is close to complete for white dwarfs near 20 pc.",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"Earth and planetary astrophysics focuses on interplanetary medium, planetary physics, planetary astrobiology, extrasolar planets, comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

Multi-wavelength view of an M2.2 Solar Flare on 26 November 2000,Multiwavelength analysis and the C IV {\lambda}1549 {\AA} emission line behavior from 2008 to 2020 of the FSRQ B2 1633+382,False,"In this paper, we present a study of an M2.2 class solar flare of 26 November 2000 from NOAA AR 9236. The flare was well observed by various ground based observatories (ARIES, Learmonths Solar Observatory) and space borne instruments (SOHO, HXRS, GOES) in time interval between 02:30 UT to 04:00 UT. The flare started with long arc-shape outer flare ribbon. Afterwards the main flare starts with two main ribbons. Initially the outer ribbons start to expand with an average speed ($\sim$ 20 km s$^{-1}$) and later it shows contraction. The flare was associated with partial halo coronal mass ejection (CMEs) which has average speed of 495 km s$^{-1}$. The SOHO/MDI observations show that the active region was in quadrupolar magnetic configuration. The flux cancellation was observed before the flare onset close to flare site. Our analysis indicate the flare was initiated by the magnetic breakout mechanism.","The flat-spectrum radio quasar B2 1633+382 (4C 38.41) has been monitored for several years and has presented correlated variability in multiple wavelengths. In this article, we are performing different analyses for multiple frequencies, from gamma-rays to radio, as well as, the C IV ${\lambda}$1549 {\AA} emission line and the ${\lambda}$1350 {\AA} continuum. Using the non-thermal dominance parameter, we separated the C IV and the continuum light curves for when the dominant source of continuum is the accretion disk or the jet. We found a correlation at a delay consistent with zero between the line and the continuum dominated by disk emission indicating a very small broad-line region (BLR). From the resulting delay between the 15 GHz and gamma-rays, we estimated the distance of the gamma-ray emission region from the jet apex to be $\sim$37 pc. The C IV flux decreases when the continuum and gamma-rays increase at some of the high activity periods. The C IV profile presents a larger variable component in its blue wing. The relation between the luminosities of C IV and the continuum does not completely follow the relation for a quasar sample. Our results lead us to propose an outflow of BLR material in the jet-flow direction, a gamma-ray production through magnetic reconnection for the flaring event of mid-2011, and that there is not enough BLR material close to the radio core to be easily ionized by the non-thermal continuum.",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"Solar and stellar astrophysics focuses on white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variables.

Synchronous coordinates and gauge-invariant observables in cosmological spacetimes,From Supernova to Remnant: Tracking the Evolution of the Oldest Known X-ray Supernovae,False,"We consider the relational approach to construct gauge-invariant observables in cosmological perturbation theory using synchronous coordinates. We construct dynamical synchronous coordinates as non-local scalar functionals of the metric perturbation in the fully non-linear theory in an arbitrary gauge. We show that the observables defined in this dynamical coordinate system are gauge-independent, and that the full perturbed metric has the expected form in these coordinates. Our construction generalises the familiar synchronous gauge in linearised gravity, widely used in cosmological perturbation theory, to the non-linear theory. We also work out the expressions for the gauge-invariant Einstein equation, sourced either by an ideal fluid or a scalar field up to second order in perturbation theory, and give explicit expressions for the Hubble rate -- as measured by synchronous observers or by observers co-moving with the matter field -- up to that order. Finally, we consider quantised linear perturbations around Minkowski and de~Sitter backgrounds, and compute the two-point function of the gauge-invariant metric perturbation in synchronous coordinates, starting with two-point function in a general linear covariant gauge. Although the gauge-fixed two-point function contains gauge modes, we show that the resulting gauge-invariant two-point function only contains the physical tensor modes and it is thus positive, \ie, it has a spectral representation.","Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) expand into a medium created by winds from the pre-SN progenitor. The SN explosion and resulting shock wave(s) heat up the surrounding plasma, giving rise to thermal X-ray emission, which depends on the density of the emitting material. Tracking the variation of the X-ray luminosity over long periods of time thus allows for investigation of the kinematics of the SN shock waves, the structure of the surrounding medium, and the nature of the progenitor star. In this paper X-ray observations of five of the oldest known X-ray supernovae - SN 1970G, SN 1968D, SN 1959D, SN 1957D and SN 1941C - are analyzed, with the aim of reconstructing their light curves over several decades. For those supernovae for which we can extract multi-epoch data, the X-ray luminosity appears to decline with time, although with large error bars. No increase in the X-ray emission from SN 1970G is found at later epochs, contrary to previous reports. All five SNe show X-ray luminosities that are of comparable magnitude. We compare the late-time X-ray luminosities of these SNe to those of supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galaxy which are a few hundred years old, and find that when the tentative decline is taken into account, the luminosity of the old SNe studied herein could fall below the luminosity of some of the younger SNRs within a few hundred years. However, the X-ray luminosity should begin to increase as the SNe expand in the Sedov phase, thus reaching that of the observed SNRs.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Finite-temperature conductance of strongly interacting quantum wire with a nuclear spin order,Robustness of Half-Integer Quantized Hall Conductivity against Disorder in an Anisotropic Dirac Semimetal with Parity Anomaly,False,"We study the temperature dependence of the electrical conductance of a clean strongly interacting quantum wire in the presence of a helical nuclear spin order. The nuclear spin helix opens a temperature-dependent partial gap in the electron spectrum. Using a bosonization framework we describe the gapped electron modes by sine-Gordon-like kinks. We predict an internal resistivity caused by an Ohmic-like friction these kinks experience via interacting with gapless excitations. As a result, the conductance rises from $G=e^2/h$ at temperatures below the critical temperature when nuclear spins are fully polarized to $G=2e^2/h$ at higher temperatures when the order is destroyed, featuring a relatively wide plateau in the intermediate regime. The theoretical results are compared with the experimental data for GaAs quantum wires obtained recently by Scheller et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 066801 (2014)].","Two-dimensional Dirac semimetals with a single massless Dirac cone exhibit the parity anomaly. Usually, such a kind of anomalous topological semimetallic phase in real materials is unstable where any amount of disorder can drive it into a diffusive metal and destroy the half-integer quantized Hall conductivity as an indicator of parity anomaly. Here, based on low-energy effective model, we propose an anisotropic Dirac semimetal which explicitly breaks time-reversal symmetry and carries a half-integer quantized Hall conductivity. This topological semimetallic phase can be realized on a deformed honeycomb lattice subjected to a magnetic flux. Moreover, we perceptively investigate the disorder correction to the Hall conductivity. The results show that the effects of disorder can be strongly suppressed and thereby the nearly half-integer quantization of Hall conductivity can exist in a wide region of disorder, indicating that our proposed anisotropic Dirac semimetal is an exciting platform to investigate the parity anomaly phenomena.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

Hidden Photons in connection to Dark Matter,Induced Universal Properties and Deconfinement,False,"Light extra U(1) gauge bosons, so called hidden photons, which reside in a hidden sector have attracted much attention since they are a well motivated feature of many scenarios beyond the Standard Model and furthermore could mediate the interaction with hidden sector dark matter. We review limits on hidden photons from past electron beam dump experiments including two new limits from such experiments at KEK and Orsay. In addition, we study the possibility of having dark matter in the hidden sector. A simple toy model and different supersymmetric realisations are shown to provide viable dark matter candidates in the hidden sector that are in agreement with recent direct detection limits.","We propose a general strategy to determine universal properties induced by a nearby phase transition on a non-order parameter field. A general renormalizable Lagrangian is used, which contains the order parameter and a non-order parameter field, and respects all the symmetries present. We investigate the case in which the order parameter field depends only on space coordinates and the case in which this field is also time dependent. We find that the spatial correlators of the non-order parameter field, in both cases, are infrared dominated and can be used to determine properties of the phase transition. We predict a universal behavior for the screening mass of a generic singlet field, and show how to extract relevant information from such a quantity. We also demonstrate that the pole mass of the non-order parameter field is not infrared sensitive. Our results can be applied to any continuous phase transition. As an example we consider the deconfining transition in pure Yang-Mills theory, and show that our findings are supported by lattice data. Our analysis suggests that monitoring the spatial correlators of different hadron species, more specifically the derivatives of these, provides an efficient and sufficient way to experimentally uncover the deconfining phase transition and its features.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

Cold dilute nuclear matter with $\alpha$-particle condensation in a generalized nonlinear relativistic mean-field model,Challenges in description of heavy-ion collisions with microscopic time-dependent approaches,False,"We explore the thermodynamic properties of homogeneous cold (zero-temperature) nuclear matter including nucleons and $\alpha$-particle condensation at low densities by using a generalized nonlinear relativistic mean-field (gNL-RMF) model. In the gNL-RMF model, the $\alpha$-particle is included as explicit degree of freedom and treated as point-like particle with its interaction described by meson exchanges and the in-medium effects on the $\alpha$ binding energy is described by density- and temperature-dependent energy shift with the parameters obtained by fitting the experimental Mott density. We find that below the dropping density $n_{\rm{drop}}$ ($\sim 3\times 10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$), the zero-temperature symmetric nuclear matter is in the state of pure Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of $\alpha$ particles while the neutron-rich nuclear matter is composed of $\alpha$-BEC and neutrons. Above the $n_{\rm{drop}}$, the fraction of $\alpha$-BEC decreases with density and vanishes at the transition density $n_t$ ($\sim 8\times 10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$). Above the $n_t$, the nuclear matter becomes pure nucleonic matter. Our results indicate that the empirical parabolic law for the isospin asymmetry dependence of nuclear matter equation of state is heavily violated by the $\alpha$-particle condensation in the zero-temperature dilute nuclear matter, making the conventional definition of the symmetry energy meaningless. We investigate the symmetry energy defined under parabolic approximation for the zero-temperature dilute nuclear matter with $\alpha$-particle condensation, and find it is significantly enhanced compared to the case without clusters and becomes saturated at about $7$ MeV at very low densities ($\lesssim 10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$). The critical temperature for $\alpha$-condensation in homogeneous dilute nuclear matter is also discussed.","Important efforts have been dedicated in the past few years to describe near-barrier heavy-ion collisions with microscopic quantum theories like the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach and some of its extensions.

A note on the motion of surfaces,Bifurcating bright and dark solitary waves of the nearly nonlinear cubic-quintic Schrodinger equation,False,"We study the motion of surfaces in an intrinsic formulation in which the surface is described by its metric and curvature tensors. The evolution equations for the six quantities contained in these tensors are reduced in number in two cases: (i) for arbitrary surfaces, we use principal coordinates to obtain two equations for the two principal curvatures, highlighting the similarity with the equations of motion of a plane curve; and (ii) for surfaces with spatially constant negative curvature, we use parameterization by Tchebyshev nets to reduce to a single evolution equation. We also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a surface to maintain spatially constant negative curvature as it moves. One choice for the surface's normal motion leads to the modified-Korteweg de Vries equation,the appearance of which is explained by connections to the AKNS hierarchy and the motion of space curves.","The existence of bright and dark multi-bump solitary waves for Ginzburg-Landau type perturbations of the cubic-quintic Schrodinger equation is considered. The waves in question are not perturbations of known analytic solitary waves, but instead arise as a bifurcation from a heteroclinic cycle in a three dimensional ODE phase space. Using geometric singular perturbation techniques, regions in parameter space for which 1-bump bright and dark solitary waves will bifurcate are identified.

Alternating lags of QPO harmonics : A Generic model and its application to the 67 millihertz QPO of GRS 1915+105,Precision Weak Gravitational Lensing Using Velocity Fields: Fisher Matrix Analysis,False,"A generic model for alternating lags in QPO harmonics is presented where variations in the photon spectrum are caused by oscillations in two parameters that characterize the spectrum. It is further assumed that variations in one of the parameters is linearly driven by variations in the other after a time delay $t_d$. It is shown that alternating lags will be observed for a range of $t_d$ values. A phenomenological model based on this generic one is developed which can explain the amplitude and phase lag variation with energy of the fundamental and the next three harmonics of the 67 mHz QPO observed in GRS 1915+105. The phenomenological model also predicts the variation of the Bicoherence phase with energy, which can be checked by further analysis of the observational data.","Weak gravitational lensing measurements based on photometry are limited by shape noise, the variance in the unknown unlensed orientations of the source galaxies. If the source is a disk galaxy with a well-ordered velocity field, however, velocity field data can support simultaneous inference of the shear, inclination, and position angle, virtually eliminating shape noise. We use the Fisher Information Matrix formalism to forecast the precision of this method in the idealized case of a perfectly ordered velocity field defined on an infinitesimally thin disk. For nearly face-on targets one shear component, $\gamma_\times$, can be constrained to $0.003\frac{90}{I_0}\frac{25}{n_{\rm pix}}$ where $I_0$ is the S/N of the central intensity pixel and $n_{\rm pix}$ is the number of pixels across a diameter enclosing 80\% of the light. This precision degrades with inclination angle, by a factor of three by $i{=}50^\circ$. Uncertainty on the other shear component, $\gamma_+$, is about 1.5 (7) times larger than the $\gamma_\times$ uncertainty for targets at $i=10^\circ$ ($50^\circ$). For arbitrary galaxy position angle on the sky, these forecasts apply not to $\gamma_+$ and $\gamma_\times$ as defined on the sky, but to two eigenvectors in $(\gamma_+, \gamma_\times,\mu)$ space where $\mu$ is the magnification. We also forecast the potential of less expensive partial observations of the velocity field such as slit spectroscopy. We conclude by outlining some ways in which real galaxies depart from our idealized model and thus create random or systematic uncertainties not captured here. In particular, our forecast $\gamma_\times$ precision is currently limited only by the data quality rather than scatter in galaxy properties because the relevant type of scatter has yet to be measured.",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"High energy astrophysical phenomena focuses on cosmic ray production, acceleration, propagation, detection.

Azimuthal Asymmetry of Prompt Photons in Nuclear Collisions,Analysis of laboratory nucleosynthesis products,False,"The azimuthal elliptic asymmetry v2 observed in heavy ion collisions, is usually associated with properties of the medium created in the final state. We compute the azimuthal asymmetry which is due to multiple interactions of partons at the initial stage of nuclear collisions, and which is also present in $pA$ collisions. In our approach the main source of azimuthal asymmetry is the combination of parton multiple interactions with the steep variation of the nuclear density at the edge of nuclei. We apply the light-cone dipole formalism to compute the azimuthal asymmetry of prompt photons yield from parton-nucleus, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the RHIC energy.","We present the results of the experimental study on synthesis of a wide range of isotopes in a superdense plasma. The initial conditions necessary for plasma bunch formation were provided by specially organized coherent impact on a solid target with a total energy up to 1 kJ. More than 4000 shots were performed with various targets made of light, medium, and heavy elements. Subsequent analysis of the products of the target explosion reveals the presence of a wide range of elements absent in the initial materials. Elements with nuclei three and more times heavier than the nucleus of the target main element are detected in the products.

Beyond the Quasi-Particle picture in Nuclear Matter calculations using Green's function techniques,Simulations of the nEDM@SNS light collection system efficiency,False,"Widths of low-lying states in nuclei are of the order of 30 MeV. These large widths are a consequence of the strong interactions leading to a strongly correlated many body system at the typical densities of nuclear matter. Nevertheless ""traditional"" Brueckner calculations treat these states as quasiparticles i.e. with spectral functions of zero widths. The width is related to the imaginary part of the selfenergy and is included selfconsistently in an extension of the Brueckner theory using T-matrix and Green's function techniques. A more general formulation applicable also to non-equilibrium systems is contained in the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equations while still maintaining the basic many-body techniques of Bruecknet theory. In the present work the two-time KB-equations are time-stepped along the imaginary time-axis to calculate the binding energy of nuclear matter as a function of density, including the spectral widths self-consistently. These zero temperature calculations are compared with quasi-particle calculations. The inclusion of the self-consistent widths are found to add several MeV to the binding. The spectral widths are due to the long-ranged correlations. Short-ranged correlations decrease rather than increase the binding. The metod is easily extended to non-zero temperatures where the importance of the widths are expected to increase.","A system for collecting the scintillation light produced by the capture process of ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) on polarized $^{3}$He is discussed and results from simulations of its performance are presented.

A new coupled computational method in conjunction with three-dimensional finite volume schemes for nonlinear coupled constitutive relations,Micromechanics analysis of thermal expansion and thermal pressurization of a hardened cement paste,False,"Non-equilibrium effects play a vital role in high-speed and rarefied gas flows and the accurate simulation of these flow regimes are far beyond the capability of near-local-equilibrium Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations. Eu proposed generalized hydrodynamic equations which are consistent with the laws of irreversible thermodynamics to solve this problem. Based on Eu's generalized hydrodynamics equations, a computational model, namely the nonlinear coupled constitutive relations(NCCR),was developed by R.S.Myong and applied successfully to one-dimensional shock wave structure and two-dimensional rarefied flows. In this paper, finite volume schemes, including LU-SGS time advance scheme, MUSCL interpolation and AUSMPW+ scheme, are fistly adopted to investigate NCCR model's validity and potential in three-dimensional complex hypersonic rarefied gas flows. Moreover, in order to solve the computational stability problems in 3D complex flows,a modified solution is developed for the NCCR model. Finally, the modified solution is tested for a slip complex flow over a 3D hollow cylinder-flare configuration. The numerical results show that the NCCR model by the modified solution yields good solutions in better agreement with the DSMC results and experimential data than NSF equations, and imply NCCR model's great potential capability in further application.",The results of a macro-scale experimental study of the effect of heating on a fluid-saturated hardened cement paste are analysed using a multi-scale homogenization model.

Relativistic Hamiltonians containing relativistic kinetic energy, relativistic OPEP with various off-shell behaviors and Argonne $v_{18}$ short-range parameterization are used to study the deuteron properties. The OPEP off-shell behaviors depend on whether a pseudovector or pseudoscalar pion-nucleon coupling is used and are characterized by a parameter $\mu$. We study potentials having $\mu$=-1, 0 and +1 and we find that they are nearly unitarily equivalent. We also find that a nonrelativistic Hamiltonian containing local potentials and nonrelativistic kinetic energy provides a good approximation to a Hamiltonian containing a relativistic OPEP based on pseudovector pion-nucleon coupling and relativistic kinetic energy.","Selected results from the STAR collaboration are presented.

Two-scale localization of wave functions in disordered wires in a weak magnetic field,Transport of Hubbard-Band Quasiparticles in Disordered Optical Lattices,False,"Using the supersymmetry technique combined with the transfer matrix method we calculate different physical quantities characterizing localization in disordered wires. In particular, we analyze the density-density correlation function and study effects of an external magnetic field $H$ on tails of wave functions. At zero and very strong magnetic fields, we obtain explicit expressions, valid at arbitrary distances, for all moments and for the entire distribution function of the density-density correlations. A two-scale decay is shown to be a typical feature of infinitely long wires at weak magnetic fields: The far tail of the wave functions decays twice as slow as their main body. Extending Mott's physical picture for the localized states we present a qualitative description of the crossover in the magnetic field. Our arguments can be used for any dimensionality indicating that the concept of the two-scale localization in a weak magnetic field is a general feature of localization. The effect is very sensitive to a level smearing and cannot be seen in the transmittance of a system with metallic leads. This means that the Borland conjecture may not be used for a numerical check of the two-scale localization.","Quantum degenerate gases trapped in optical lattices are ideal testbeds for fundamental physics because these systems are tunable, well characterized, and isolated from the environment. Controlled disorder can be introduced to explore suppression of quantum diffusion in the absence of conventional dephasing mechanisms such as phonons, which are unavoidable in experiments on electronic solids. Recent experiments use transport of degenerate Fermi gases in optical lattices (Kondov et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 083002 (2015)) to probe a particularly extreme regime of strong interaction in what can be modeled as an Anderson-Hubbard model. These experiments find evidence for an intriguing insulating phase where quantum diffusion is completely suppressed by strong disorder. Quantitative interpretation of these experiments remains an open problem that requires inclusion of non-zero entropy, strong interaction, and trapping. We argue that the suppression of transport can be thought of as localization of Hubbard-band quasiparticles. We construct a theory of transport of Hubbard-band quasiparticles tailored to trapped optical lattice experiments. We compare the theory directly with center-of-mass transport experiments of Kondov et al. with no fitting parameters. The close agreement between theory and experiments shows that the suppression of transport is only partly due to finite entropy effects. We argue that the complete suppression of transport is consistent with Anderson localization of Hubbard-band quasiparticles.

Signals embedded in the radial velocity noise. Periodic variations in the tau Ceti velocities,On the gauge dependence of gravitational waves generated at second order from scalar perturbations,False,"The abilities of radial velocity exoplanet surveys to detect the lowest-mass extra-solar planets are currently limited by a combination of instrument precision, lack of data, and ""jitter"". Jitter is a general term for any unknown features in the noise, and reflects a lack of detailed knowledge of stellar physics (asteroseismology, starspots, magnetic cycles, granulation, and other stellar surface phenomena), as well as the possible underestimation of instrument noise. We study an extensive set of radial velocities for the star HD 10700 ($\tau$ Ceti) to determine the properties of the jitter arising from stellar surface inhomogeneities, activity, and telescope-instrument systems, and perform a comprehensive search for planetary signals in the radial velocities. We perform Bayesian comparisons of statistical models describing the radial velocity data to quantify the number of significant signals and the magnitude and properties of the excess noise in the data. We reach our goal by adding artificial signals to the ""flat"" radial velocity data of HD 10700 and by seeing which one of our statistical noise models receives the greatest posterior probabilities while still being able to extract the artificial signals correctly from the data. We utilise various noise components to assess properties of the noise in the data and analyse the HARPS, AAPS, and HIRES data for HD 10700 to quantify these properties and search for previously unknown low-amplitude Keplerian signals. ...","We revisit and clarify the gauge dependence of gravitational waves generated at second order from scalar perturbations. In a universe dominated by a perfect fluid with a constant equation-of-state parameter $w$, we compute the energy density of such induced gravitational waves in the Newtonian, comoving, and uniform curvature gauges. Huge differences are found between the Newtonian and comoving gauge results for any $w \,(\ge 0)$. This is always caused by the perturbation of the shift vector. Interestingly, the Newtonian and uniform curvature gauge calculations give the same energy density for $w>0$. In the case of $w=0$, the uniform curvature gauge result differs only by a factor from that of the comoving gauge, but deviates significantly from that of the Newtonian gauge.

R. Kasimov, L. M. Faria, and R. R. Rosales. Model for shock wave chaos. Physical Review Letters, 110(10):104104, 2013].

We investigate the nature of the steady-state solutions of this nonlocal hyperbolic balance law, the linear stability of these solutions, and the nonlinear dynamics. We establish the existence of instability followed by a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations leading to chaos.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Adaptive Test Allocation for Outbreak Detection and Tracking in Social Contact Networks,Statefinder Parameters for Different Dark Energy Models with Variable G Correction in Kaluza-Klein Cosmology,False,"We present a general framework for adaptive allocation of viral tests in social contact networks. We pose and solve several complementary problems. First, we consider the design of a social sensing system whose objective is the early detection of a novel epidemic outbreak. In particular, we propose an algorithm to select a subset of individuals to be tested in order to detect the onset of an epidemic outbreak as fast as possible. We pose this problem as a hitting time probability maximization problem and use submodularity optimization techniques to derive explicit quality guarantees for the proposed solution. Second, once an epidemic outbreak has been detected, we consider the problem of adaptively distributing viral tests over time in order to maximize the information gained about the current state of the epidemic. We formalize this problem in terms of information entropy and mutual information and propose an adaptive allocation strategy with quality guarantees. For these problems, we derive analytical solutions for any stochastic compartmental epidemic model with Markovian dynamics, as well as efficient Monte-Carlo-based algorithms for non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed framework in numerical experiments involving a model of Covid-19 applied to a real human contact network.","In this work, we have calculated the deceleration parameter, statefinder parameters and EoS parameters for different dark energy models with variable $G$ correction in homogeneous, isotropic and non-flat universe for Kaluza-Klein Cosmology.

Light bullets in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic topological insulators,Failure mechanisms of load sharing complex systems,False,"We introduce a different class of thresholdless three-dimensional soliton states that form in higher-order topological insulators based on a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger array of coupled waveguides. The linear spectrum of such structures is characterized by the presence of a topological gap with corner states residing in them. We find that a focusing Kerr nonlinearity allows families of light bullets bifurcating from the linear corner states to exist as stable three-dimensional solitons, which inherit topological protection from their linear corner counterparts and, remarkably, survive even in the presence of considerable disorder. The light bullets exhibit a spatial localization degree that depends strongly on the array dimerization and may feature large temporal widths in the topological gap near the bifurcation point, thus drastically reducing the otherwise strong instabilities caused by higher-order effects.","We investigate the failure mechanisms of load sharing complex systems. The system is composed of multiple nodes or components whose failures are determined based on the interaction of their respective strengths and loads (or capacity and demand respectively) as well as the ability of a component to share its load with its neighbors when needed. We focus on two distinct mechanisms to model the interaction between components' strengths and loads. The failure mechanisms of these two models demonstrate temporal scaling phenomena, phase transitions and multiple distinct failure modes excited by extremal dynamics. For critical ranges of parameters the models demonstrate power law and exponential failure patterns. We identify the similarities and differences between the two mechanisms and the implications of our results to the failure mechanisms of complex systems in the real world.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

A covering theory of special relativity,Mie Resonance Enhancement of Laser Cooling in Rare-Earth Doped Materials,False,"Under the assumption of closed-path velocity of light invariant, we show both the general expression of velocity of light in an ordinary inertial reference frame and the generalized Lorentz transformation between the ordinary inertial reference frame and the absolute (privileged) reference frame. Although such assumption can not determine theory ambiguously, some significant results can still be obtained by the assumption. Furthermore, the study shows that the relativity of simultaneity is not a universal concept.","Laser cooling of solids keeps attracting attention owing to abroad range of its applications that extends from cm-sized all-optical cryocoolers for airborne and space-based applications to cooling on nanoparticles for biological and mesoscopic physics. Laser cooling of nanoparticles is a challenging task. We propose to use Mie resonances to enhance anti-Stokes fluorescence laser cooling in rare-earth (RE) doped nanoparticles made of low-phonon glasses or crystals. As an example, we consider an Yb3+:YAG nanosphere pumped at the long wavelength tail of the Yb3+ absorption spectrum at 1030 nm. We show that if the radius of the nanosphere is adjusted to the pump wavelength in such a manner that the pump excites some of its Mie resonant modes, the cooling power density generated in the sample is considerably enhanced and the temperature of the sample is consequently considerably (~ 63%) decreased. This concept can be extended to nanoparticles of different shapes and made from different low-phonon RE doped materials suitable for laser cooling by anti-Stokes fluorescence.",Classical Physics,"Classical physics focuses on newtonian and relativistic dynamics; many particle systems; planetary motions; chaos in classical dynamics.

Fermions with no fundamental charges call for extra dimensions,Implications of Dynamical Generation of Standard-Model Fermion Masses,False,"We call attention to that if assuming no conserved charges in the fundamental theory with fermions, which carry only a spin and interact with only the gravity, the dimensions $4, 12, 20,.....,$ as well as all odd dimensions, are excluded under the requirement of mass protection. If more than one family is required, than only dimensions d=2 (mod 4) remains as acceptable, since then other by 4 devisable dimensions are excluded.","We point out that if quark and lepton masses arise dynamically, then in a wide class of theories the corresponding running masses $m_{f_j}(p)$ exhibit the power-law decay $m_{f_j}(p) \propto \Lambda_j^2/p^2$ for Euclidean momenta $p >> \Lambda_j$, where $f_j$ is a fermion of generation $j$, and $\Lambda_j$ is the maximal scale relevant for the origin of $m_{f_j}$. We estimate resultant changes in precision electroweak quantities and compare with current data. It is found that this data allows the presence of such corrections.

The Effect of Ionic Spin on Multiferroic of Orthorhombic Perovskite,High field charge order across the phase diagram of $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$,False,"To investigate the influence of ion spin on the coupling between ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in type II multiferroic perovskite, we prepared the multiferroic perovskite Er0.9La0.1Cr0.8Fe0.2O3 (ELCFO) using the sol-gel method, and explored the macroscopic magnetic properties of ELCFO through M\""ossbauer spectrum and magnetic testing. The thermal magnetic curve was analyzed to examine the state and change of each ionic spin in the ELCFO system at different temperature ranges, and the role of ionic spin in the coupling between ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity was investigated. This study provides a theoretical basis for further research on multiferroic perovskites and has practical implications.","In hole-doped cuprates there is now compelling evidence that inside the pseudogap phase, charge order breaks translational symmetry leading to a reconstruction of the Fermi surface. In $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ charge order emerges in two steps: a 2D order found at zero field and at high temperature inside the pseudogap phase, and a 3D order that is superimposed below the superconducting transition $T_c$ when superconductivity is weakened by a magnetic field. Several issues still need to be addressed such as the effect of disorder, the relationship between those charge orders and their respective impact on the Fermi surface. Here, we report high magnetic field sound velocity measurements of the 3D charge order in underdoped $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ in a large doping range. We found that the 3D charge order exists over the same doping range as its 2D counterpart, indicating an intimate connection between the two distinct orders. Moreover, we argue that the Fermi surface is reconstructed above the onset temperature of 3D charge order.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

Large N Quantum Gravity,"Dark Matter ""Collider"" from Inelastic Boosted Dark Matter",False,"We obtain the effective action of four dimensional quantum gravity, induced by N massless matter fields, by integrating the RG flow of the relative effective average action. By considering the leading approximation in the large N limit, where one neglects the gravitational contributions with respect to the matter contributions, we show how different aspects of quantum gravity, as asymptotic safety, quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential and the conformal anomaly induced effective action, are all represented by different terms of the effective action when this is expanded in powers of the curvature.","We propose a novel dark matter (DM) detection strategy for the models with non-minimal dark sector. The main ingredients in the underlying DM scenario are a boosted DM particle and a heavier dark sector state. The relativistic DM impinged on target material scatters off inelastically to the heavier state which subsequently decays into DM along with lighter states including visible (Standard Model) particles. The expected signal event, therefore, accompanies a visible signature by the secondary cascade process associated with a recoiling of the target particle, differing from the typical neutrino signal not involving the secondary signature. We then discuss various kinematic features followed by DM detection prospects at large volume neutrino detectors with a model framework where a dark gauge boson is the mediator between the Standard Model particles and DM.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Moving Bose mixtures with dipole-dipole interactions,Magnetoresistance of mesoscopic granular ferromagnets,False,"We study the properties of moving uniform dipolar Bose-Bose mixtures using the full Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. The analytical and numerical calculations emphasize that the competition between the relative motion of two fluids and the interspecies dipole-dipole interactions may affect the behavior of the condensed depletion, the anomalous density, the ground-state energy and second-order pair correlation. It is found that in the lower branch of the mixture, these quantities are unimportant and present an unconventional behavior.","We have performed magnetoresistance (MR) measurements of granular ferromagnets having lateral dimensions smaller than 0.5 $\mu$m and containing a small number of grains (down to about 100). Compared to macroscopic samples, these granular samples exhibit unusually large saturation fields and MR amplitudes. In addition, the evolution of the magnetoresistance curve as the intergrain distance decreases is qualitatively different than that of large samples.

A dark energy view of inflation,When and how does ram pressure stripping in low-mass satellite galaxies enhance star formation,False,"Traditionally, inflationary models are analyzed in terms of parameters such as the scalar spectral index ns and the tensor to scalar ratio r, while dark energy models are studied in terms of the equation of state parameter w. Motivated by the fact that both deal with periods of accelerated expansion, we study the evolution of w during inflation, in order to derive observational constraints on its value during an earlier epoch likely dominated by a dynamic form of dark energy. We find that the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure data is consistent with w_inflation=-1 and provides an upper limit of 1+w <~ 0.02. Nonetheless, an exact de Sitter expansion with a constant w=-1 is disfavored since this would result in ns=1.","We investigate how a satellite's star formation rate (SFR) and surviving gas respond to ram pressure stripping in various environments. Using a suite of high-resolution ""wind-tunnel"" simulations with radiative cooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback, we model the first infall orbit of a low-mass disk galaxy ($M_{*} = 10^{9.7} M_{\odot}$) in different host halos, ranging from Milky Way-like to cluster hosts. When the ram pressure is moderate, we find that the stripping satellite shows an enhanced SFR relative to the isolated control case, despite gas loss due to stripping. The SFR enhancement is caused, not directly by compression, but by ram pressure-driven mass flows, which can increase the dense gas fraction in the central disk regions. The spatially-resolved star formation main sequence and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations in our simulations are consistent with recent findings of the VERTICO and GASP surveys.

Curing Braess' Paradox by Secondary Control in Power Grids,Nonlinear Behaviour of Time-Stepping Algorithms for Initial Value Problems,False,"Robust operation of power transmission grids is essential for most of today's technical infrastructure and our daily life. Adding renewable generation to power grids requires grid extensions and sophisticated control actions on different time scales to cope with short-term fluctuations and long-term power imbalance. Braess' paradox constitutes a counterintuitive collective phenomenon that occurs if adding new transmission line capacity to a network increases loads on other lines, effectively reducing the system's performance and potentially even entirely removing its operating state. Combining simple analytical considerations with numerical investigations on a small sample network, we here study dynamical consequences of secondary control in AC power grid models. We demonstrate that sufficiently strong control not only implies dynamical stability of the system but may also cure Braess' paradox. Our results highlight the importance of demand control in conjunction with grid topology for stable operation and reveal a new functional benefit of secondary control.","Recent advances in nonlinear dynamical systems theory provide a new insight into numerical properties of discrete algorithms developed to solve nonlinear initial value problems. Basic features like accuracy and stability are well pointed out through diagrams or maps of computed asymptotic solutions in a suitable parametric space. Applying this methodology to a nonlinear test equation, we compared some numerical features of the well known second-order Crank-Nicolson solver with those of a recent proposed version which is fourth-order accurate.

Effective boson-spin model for nuclei ensemble based universal quantum memory,Nonreciprocal interactions give rise to fast cilium synchronisation in finite systems,False,"We study the collective excitation of a macroscopic ensemble of polarized nuclei fixed in a quantum dot. Under the approximately homogeneous condition that we explicitly present in this paper, this many-particle system behaves as a single mode boson interacting with the spin of a single conduction band electron confined in this quantum dot. Within this effective spin-boson system, the quantum information carried by the electronic spin can be coherently transferred into the collective bosonic mode of excitation in the ensemble of nuclei. In this sense, the collective bosonic excitation can serve as a stable quantum memory to store the quantum information of spin state of electron.","Motile cilia beat in an asymmetric fashion in order to propel the surrounding fluid. When many cilia are located on a surface, their beating can synchronise such that their phases form metachronal waves. Here, we computationally study a model where each cilium is represented as a spherical particle, moving along a tilted trajectory with a position-dependent active driving force and a position-dependent internal drag coefficient. The model thus takes into account all the essential broken symmetries of the ciliary beat. We show that taking into account the near-field hydrodynamic interactions, the effective coupling between cilia can become nonreciprocal: the phase of a cilium is more strongly affected by an adjacent cilium on one side than by a cilium at the same distance in the opposite direction. As a result, synchronisation starts from a seed at the edge of a group of cilia and propagates rapidly across the system, leading to a synchronisation time that scales proportionally to the linear dimension of the system. We show that a ciliary carpet is characterised by three different velocities: the velocity of fluid transport, the phase velocity of metachronal waves and the group velocity of order propagation. Unlike in systems with reciprocal coupling, boundary effects are not detrimental for synchronisation, but rather enable the formation of the initial seed.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

On the theory of light scattering in molecular liquids,Visualizing the periodic modulation of Cooper pairing in a severely underdoped cuprate,False,"The theory of light scattering for a system of linear molecules with anisotropic polarizabilities is considered. As a starting point for our theory, we express the result of a scattering experiment in VV and VH symmetry as dynamic correlation functions of tensorial densities $\rho_{lm}(q)$ with $l=0$ and $l=2$. $l$, $m$ denote indices of spherical harmonics. To account for all observed hydrodynamic singularities, a generalization of the theory of Schilling and Scheidsteger \cite{schilling97} for these correlation functions is presented, which is capable to describe the light scattering experiments from the liquid regime to the glassy state. As a microscopic theory it fulfills all sum rules contrary to previous {\em phenomenological} theories. We emphasize the importance of the helicity index $m$ for the microscopic theory by showing, that only the existence of $m=1$ components lead to the well known Rytov dip in liquids and to the appearance of transversal sound waves in VH symmetry in the deeply supercooled liquid and the glass. Exact expressions for the phenomenological frequency dependent rotation translation coupling coefficients of previous theories are derived.","A major obstacle in understanding the mechanism of Cooper pairing in the cuprates is the existence of various intertwined orders associated with spin, charge, and Cooper pairs. Of particular importance is the ubiquitous charge order features that have been observed in a variety of cuprates, especially in the underdoped regime of the phase diagram. To explain the origin of the charge order and its implication to the superconducting phase, many theoretical models have been proposed, such as charge stripes, electronic nematicity, and Fermi surface instability. A highly appealing physical picture is the so-called pair density wave (PDW), a periodic modulation of Cooper paring in space, which may also induce a charge order. To elucidate the existence and nature of the PDW order, here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to investigate a severely underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}, in which superconductivity just emerges on top of a pronounced checkerboard charge order. By analyzing the spatial distribution of the spectral features characteristic of superconductivity, we observe a periodic modulation of both the superconducting coherence peak and gap depth, demonstrating the existence of a density wave order of Cooper pairing. The PDW order has the same spatial periodicity as the charge order, and the amplitudes of the two orders exhibit clear positive correlation. These results shed important new lights on the origin of and interplay between the charge order and Cooper pairing modulation in the cuprates.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Acoustic-like dynamics of amorphous drugs in the THz regime,Current-Induced Motion of Narrow Domain Walls and Dissipation in Ferromagnetic Metals,False,"The high frequency dynamics of Indomethacin and Celecoxib glasses has been investigated by inelastic x-ray scattering, accessing a momentum-energy region still unexplored in amorphous pharmaceuticals. We find evidence of phonon-like acoustic dynamics, and determine the THz behavior of sound velocity and acoustic attenuation. Connections with ordinary sound propagation are discussed, along with the relation between fast and slow degrees of freedom as represented by non-ergodicity factor and kinetic fragility, respectively.","Spin transport equations in a non-homogeneous ferromagnet are derived in the limit where the sd exchange coupling between the electrons in the conduction band and those in the d band is dominant. It is shown that spin diffusion in ferromagnets assumes a tensor form. The diagonal terms are renormalized with respect to that in normal metals and enhances the dissipation in the magnetic system while the off-diagonal terms renormalize the precessional frequency of the conduction electrons and enhances the non-adiabatic spin torque. To demonstrate the new physics in our theory, we show that self-consistent solutions of the spin diffusion equations and the Landau-Lifshitz equations in the presence of a current lead to a an increase in the terminal velocity of a domain wall which becomes strongly dependent on its width.

To this end, we first review the main features of the normal mode of the program and how a detector simulation can be handled. We then detail, step-by-step, how to implement and validate an existing LHC analysis in the MadAnalysis 5 framework and how to use this reimplementation, possibly together with other recast codes available from the MadAnalysis 5 Public Analysis Database, for reinterpreting ATLAS and CMS searches in the context of a new model. Each of these points is illustrated by concrete examples. Moreover, complete reference cards for the normal and expert modes of MadAnalysis 5 are provided in two technical appendices.","We constrain the neutrino mass in the scenario of vacuum energy interacting with cold dark matter by using current cosmological observations. To avoid the large-scale instability problem in interacting dark energy models, we employ the parameterized post-Friedmann (PPF) approach to do the calculation of perturbation evolution, for the $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ and $Q=\beta H\rho_{\Lambda}$ models. The current observational data sets used in this work include Planck (cosmic microwave background), BSH (baryon acoustic oscillations, type Ia supernovae, and Hubble constant), and LSS (redshift space distortions and weak lensing). According to the constraint results, we find that $\beta>0$ at more than $1\sigma$ level for the $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ model, which indicates that cold dark matter decays into vacuum energy; while $\beta=0$ is consistent with the current data at $1\sigma$ level for the $Q=\beta H\rho_{\Lambda}$ model. Taking the $\Lambda$CDM model as a baseline model, we find that a smaller upper limit, $\sum m_{\nu}<0.11$ eV ($2\sigma$), is induced by the latest BAO BOSS DR12 data and the Hubble constant measurement $H_{0} = 73.00 \pm 1.75$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$.

We find that optimization of a single parameter manages to considerably improve on the severity of the sign problem.

Non-Equilibrium Dynamics and Superfluid Ring Excitations in Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates,Dynamical self-assembly of dipolar active Brownian particles in two dimensions,False,"We revisit a classic study [D.

Lett. {\bf 81}, 1539 (1998)] of interpenetrating Bose-Einstein condensates in the hyperfine states $\ket{F = 1, m_f = -1}\equiv\ket{1}$ and $\ket{F = 2, m_f = +1}\equiv\ket{2}$ of ${}^{87}$Rb and observe striking new non-equilibrium component separation dynamics in the form of oscillating ring-like structures. The process of component separation is not significantly damped, a finding that also contrasts sharply with earlier experimental work, allowing a clean first look at a collective excitation of a binary superfluid. We further demonstrate extraordinary quantitative agreement between theoretical and experimental results using a multi-component mean-field model with key additional features: the inclusion of atomic losses and the careful characterization of trap potentials (at the level of a fraction of a percent).","Based on Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations, we study the dynamical self-assembly of active Brownian particles with dipole-dipole interactions, stemming from a permanent point dipole at the particle center. The propulsion direction of each particle is chosen to be parallel to its dipole moment. We explore a wide range of motilities and dipolar coupling strengths and characterize the corresponding behavior based on several order parameters. At low densities and low motilities, the most important structural phenomenon is the aggregation of the dipolar particles into chains. Upon increasing the particle motility, these chain-like structures break, and the system transforms into a weakly correlated isotropic fluid. At high densities, we observe that the motility-induced phase separation is strongly suppressed by the dipolar coupling. Once the dipolar coupling dominates the thermal energy, the phase separation disappears, and the system rather displays a flocking state, where particles form giant clusters and move collective along one direction. We provide arguments for the emergence of the flocking behavior, which is absent in the passive dipolar system.",Other Condensed Matter,Other condensed matter in physics focuses on topics that fall outside the scope of more specific categories.
Tagging new physics with charm,Induced Chern-Simons modified gravity at finite temperature,False,"We propose a new variable, the charm fraction, for collider searches for new physics. We analyze this variable in the context of searches for simplified supersymmetry models with squarks, the gluino, and the bino, assuming that only the lightest mass-degenerate squarks can be produced at the high-luminosity LHC. The charm fraction complements event counting and kinematic information, increasing the sensitivity of the searches for models with heavy gluinos, for which squark production is flavor-blind. If squarks are discovered at the LHC, this variable can help discriminate between different underlying models. In particular, with improved charm tagging, the charm fraction can provide information on the gluino mass, and in some scenarios, on whether this mass is within the reach of a future 100 TeV hadron collider.","We calculate the linearized four-dimensional gravitational Chern-Simons term at the finite temperature, show its finiteness and explicitly demonstrate that its transversal part matches the known result for the chiral vortical conductivity.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

By combining CMB temperature anisotropies with a tracer of structure, such as a galaxy redshift survey, previous literature introduced a number of techniques to reconstruct the radial velocity field. This reconstructed radial velocity field encapsulates the majority of the cosmological information contained in the kSZ temperature anisotropies, and can provide powerful new tests of the standard cosmological model and theories beyond it. In this paper, we introduce a new estimator for the radial velocity field based on a coarse-grained maximum likelihood fit for the kSZ component of the temperature anisotropies, given a tracer of the optical depth. We demonstrate that this maximum likelihood estimator yields a higher fidelity reconstruction than existing quadratic estimators in the low-noise and high-resolution regime targeted by upcoming CMB experiments. We describe implementations of the maximum likelihood estimator in both harmonic space and map space, using either direct measurements of the optical depth field or a galaxy survey as a tracer. We comment briefly on the impact of biases introduced by imperfect reconstruction of the optical depth field.","We present high-precision photometry on 107 variable low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the ~3 Myr Sigma Orionis open cluster. We have carried out I-band photometric monitoring within two fields, encompassing 153 confirmed or candidate members of the low-mass cluster population, from 0.02 to 0.5 M_\odot. We are sensitive to brightness changes on time scales from 10 minutes to two weeks with amplitudes as low as 0.004 magnitudes, and find variability on these time scales in nearly 70% of cluster members. We identify both periodic and aperiodic modes of variability, as well as semi-periodic rapid fading events that are not accounted for by the standard explanations of rotational modulation of surface features or accretion. We have incorporated both optical and infrared color data to uncover trends in variability with mass and circumstellar disks. While the data confirm that the lowest-mass objects (M<0.2M_\odot) rotate more rapidly than the 0.2-0.5 M_\odot members, they do not support a direct connection between rotation rate and the presence of a disk. Finally, we speculate on the origin of irregular variability in cluster members with no evidence for disks or accretion.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Bose-Einstein condensates in multiple well potentials from a variational path integral,Dynamics and physical interpretation of quasi-stationary states in systems with long-range interactions,False,"We apply a path integral variational approach to obtain analytical expressions for condensate wave functions of an ultracold, interacting trapped Bose gases. As in many recent experiments, the particles are confined in a 1D or 3D harmonic oscillator trap which is superimposed by a periodic potential in one direction. Based on the first order cumulant expansion with respect to a harmonic trial action, and emplyoing a mean-field approximation, optimal variational parameters are obtained by minimizing an analytical expression for the ground state energy. Our largely analytical results for energy and condensate wave function are in good agreement with fully numerical calculations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.","Although the Vlasov equation is used as a good approximation for a sufficiently large $N$, Braun and Hepp have showed that the time evolution of the one particle distribution function of a $N$ particle classical Hamiltonian system with long range interactions satisfies the Vlasov equation in the limit of infinite $N$. Here we rederive this result using a different approach allowing a discussion of the role of inter-particle correlations on the system dynamics. Otherwise for finite N collisional corrections must be introduced. This has allowed the a quite comprehensive study of the Quasi Stationary States (QSS) but many aspects of the physical interpretations of these states remain unclear. In this paper a proper definition of timescale for long time evolution is discussed and several numerical results are presented, for different values of $N$. Previous reports indicates that the lifetimes of the QSS scale as $N^{1.7}$ or even the system properties scales with $\exp(N)$. However, preliminary results presented here shows indicates that time scale goes as $N^2$ for a different type of initial condition. We also discuss how the form of the inter-particle potential determines the convergence of the $N$-particle dynamics to the Vlasov equation. The results are obtained in the context of following models: the Hamiltonian Mean Field, the Self Gravitating Ring Model, and a 2-D Systems of Gravitating Particles. We have also provided information of the validity of the Vlasov equation for finite $N$, i. e.\ how the dynamics converges to the mean-field (Vlasov) description as $N$ increases and how inter-particle correlations arise.",Quantum Gases,"Quantum gases in condensed matter physics focuses on ultracold atomic and molecular gases, Bose-Einstein condensation, Feshbach resonances, spinor condensates, optical lattices, quantum simulation with cold atoms and molecules, and macroscopic interference phenomena."
Rational solutions for three semi-discrete modified Korteweg-de Vries type equations,Frobenius-Perron Resonances for Maps with a Mixed Phase Space,False,"In this paper, we consider three semi-discrete modified Korteweg-de Vries type equations which are the nonlinear lumped self-dual network equation,the semi-discrete lattice potential modified Korteweg-de Vries equation and a semi-discrete modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. We derive several kinds of exact solutions, in particular rational solutions, in terms of the Casorati determinant for these three equations respectively. For some rational solutions, we present the related asymptotic analysis to understand their dynamics better.","Resonances of the time evolution (Frobenius-Perron) operator P for phase space densities have recently been shown to play a key role for the interrelations of classical, semiclassical and quantum dynamics. Efficient methods to determine resonances are thus in demand, in particular for Hamiltonian systems displaying a mix of chaotic and regular behavior.

Hidden velocity ordering in dense suspensions of self-propelled disks,Instability of insulating states in optical lattices due to collective phonon excitations,False,"Recent studies of the phase diagram for spherical, purely repulsive, active particles established the existence of a transition from a liquid-like to a solid-like phase analogous to the one observed in colloidal systems at thermal equilibrium, in particular in two dimensions an intermediate hexatic phase is observed. Here, we present evidence that the active dense phases (solid, hexatic and liquid) exhibit interesting dynamical anomalies. First, we unveil the growth - with density and activity - of ordered domains where the particles' velocities align in parallel or vortex-like patches. Second, when activity is strong, the spatial distribution of kinetic energy becomes heterogeneous with high energy regions correlated to defects of the crystalline structure. This spatial heterogeneity is accompanied by temporal intermittency, with sudden peaks in the time-series of kinetic energy. The observed dynamical anomalies are not present in a dense equilibrium system and cannot be detected by considering only the structural properties of the system.","The role of collective phonon excitations on the properties of cold atoms in optical lattices is investigated. These phonon excitations are collective excitations, whose appearance is caused by intersite atomic interactions correlating the atoms, and they do not arise without such interactions. These collective excitations should not be confused with lattice vibrations produced by an external force. No such a force is assumed. But the considered phonons are purely self-organized collective excitations, characterizing atomic oscillations around lattice sites, due to intersite atomic interactions. It is shown that these excitations can essentially influence the possibility of atoms to be localized. The states that would be insulating in the absence of phonon excitations can become delocalized when these excitations are taken into account. This concerns long-range as well as local atomic interactions. To characterize the region of stability, the Lindemann criterion is used.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Combining initial-state resummation with fixed-order calculations of electroweak corrections,Quantum Field Theory on Spacetimes with a Compactly Generated Cauchy Horizon,False,"We present a resummation of those double-logarithmically enhanced electroweak correction that arise in pp colliders because protons are not SU(2) singlets, by solving DGLAP equations in the full Standard Model. We then show how to match these results with those of fixed-order electroweak calculations. At a 100 TeV pp collider, contributions beyond order alpha are ~ 10% at partonic center-of-mass energies of a few TeV. These are mainly due to initial states with massive vector bosons.","We prove two theorems which concern difficulties in the formulation of the quantum theory of a linear scalar field on a spacetime, (M,g_{ab}), with a compactly generated Cauchy horizon. These theorems demonstrate the breakdown of the theory at certain `base points' of the Cauchy horizon, which are defined as `past terminal accumulation points' of the horizon generators. Thus, the theorems may be interpreted as giving support to Hawking's `Chronology Protection Conjecture', according to which the laws of physics prevent one from manufacturing a `time machine'. Specifically, we prove: Theorem 1: There is no extension to (M,g_{ab}) of the usual field algebra on the initial globally hyperbolic region which satisfies the condition of F-locality at any base point. In other words, any extension of the field algebra must, in any globally hyperbolic neighbourhood of any base point, differ from the algebra one would define on that neighbourhood according to the rules for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Theorem 2: The two-point distribution for any Hadamard state defined on the initial globally hyperbolic region must (when extended to a distributional bisolution of the covariant Klein-Gordon equation on the full spacetime) be singular at every base point x in the sense that the difference between this two point distribution and a local Hadamard distribution cannot be given by a bounded function in any neighbourhood (in MXM) of (x,x). Theorem 2 implies quantities such as the renormalized expectation value of \phi^2 or of the stress-energy tensor are necessarily ill-defined or singular at any base point.

Theory of Static and Dynamic Antiferromagnetic Vortices in LSCO Superconductors,Exact results of the one-dimensional tranverse Ising model in an external longitudinal magnetic field,False,"A key prediction of the SO(5) theory is the antiferromagnetic vortex state. Recent neutron scattering experiment on LSCO superconductors revealed enhanced antiferromagnetic order in the vortex state. Here we review theoretical progress since the original proposal and present a theory of static and dynamic antiferromanetic vortices in LSCO superconductors. It is shown that the antiferromagnetic region induced by the vortices can be greater than the coherence length, due to the light effective mass of the dynamic antiferromagnetic fluctuations at optimal doping, and close promixity to the antiferromagentic state in the underdoped regime. Systematic experiments are proposed to unambiguously determine that the field induced magnetic scattering originates from the vortices and not from the bulk.","Magnetic properties of the 1D mixed spin-1/2 and spin-S (S >1/2) transverse Ising model in the presence of an external longitudinal magnetic field are calculated exactly by the use of the generalised decoration-iteration mapping transformation. By assuming that only the spin-S atoms do interact with the transverse field the exact results for the Gibbs free energy, longitudinal magnetization, transverse magnetization, entropy and specific heat have been derived and discussed in detail. In addition to the standard temperature variations of the transverse magnetization, another two non-trivial thermal dependences have been found. The results support the concept that the spin reorientation from the longitudinal towards the transverse field direction takes place in the narrow temperature region.",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

Approximate Universal Relations for Neutron Stars and Quark Stars,GK Boo and AE For: Two low-mass eclipsing binaries with dwarf companions,False,"Neutron stars and quark stars are ideal laboratories to study fundamental physics at supra nuclear densities and strong gravitational fields. Astrophysical observables, however, depend strongly on the star's internal structure, which is currently unknown due to uncertainties in the equation of state. Universal relations, however, exist among certain stellar observables that do not depend sensitively on the star's internal structure. One such set of relations is between the star's moment of inertia ($I$), its tidal Love number (Love) and its quadrupole moment ($Q$), the so-called I-Love-Q relations. Similar relations hold among the star's multipole moments, which resemble the well-known black hole no-hair theorems. Universal relations break degeneracies among astrophysical observables, leading to a variety of applications: (i) X-ray measurements of the nuclear matter equation of state, (ii) gravitational wave measurements of the intrinsic spin of inspiraling compact objects, and (iii) gravitational and astrophysical tests of General Relativity that are independent of the equation of state. We here review how the universal relations come about and all the applications that have been devised to date.","A study of late-type low-mass eclipsing binaries provides us with important information about the most common stars in the Universe. We obtain the first light curves and perform period analyses of two neglected eclipsing binaries GK Boo and AE For to reveal their basic physical properties. We performed both a period analysis of the times of the minima and a BVR light curve analysis. Many new times of minima for both the systems were derived and collected from the data obtained by automatic and robotic telescopes. This allowed us to study the long-term period changes in these systems for the first time. From the light curve analysis, we derived the first rough estimates of the physical properties of these systems. We find that the analyzed systems are somewhat similar to each other. Both contain low-mass components of similar types, both are close to the Sun, both have short orbital period, and both contain another low-mass companions on longer orbits of a few years. In the case of GK Boo, both components are probably of K3 spectral type, while the distant companion is probably a late M star. The light curve of GK Boo is asymmetric, which probably causes the shift in the secondary minima in the O-C diagram. System AE For comprises two K7 stars, and the third body is a possible brown dwarf with a minimal mass of only about 47 Jupiter Mass. We succeed in completing period and light curve analyses of both systems, although a more detailed spectroscopic analysis is needed to confirm the physical parameters of the components to a higher accuracy.",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"High energy astrophysical phenomena focuses on cosmic ray production, acceleration, propagation, detection.

Designing Disordered Hyperuniform Two-Phase Materials with Novel Physical Properties,Correlation Time for Step Structural Fluctuations,False,"Heterogeneous materials consisting of different phases are ideally suited to achieve a broad spectrum of desirable bulk physical properties by combining the best features of the constituents through the strategic spatial arrangement of the different phases. Disordered hyperuniform heterogeneous materials are new, exotic amorphous matter that behave like crystals in the manner in which they suppress volume-fraction fluctuations at large length scales, and yet are isotropic with no Bragg peaks. In this paper, we formulate for the first time a Fourier-space numerical construction procedure to design at will a wide class of disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with prescribed spectral densities, which enables one to tune the degree and length scales at which this suppression occurs. We demonstrate that the anomalous suppression of volume-fraction fluctuations in such two-phase materials endow them with novel and often optimal transport and electromagnetic properties. Specifically, we construct a family of phase-inversion-symmetric materials with variable topological connectedness properties that remarkably achieves a well-known explicit formula for the effective electrical (thermal) conductivity. Moreover, we design disordered stealthy hyperuniform dispersion that possesses nearly optimal effective conductivity while being statistically isotropic. Interestingly, all of our designed materials are transparent to electromagnetic radiation for certain wavelengths, which is a common attribute of all hyperuniform materials. Our constructed materials can be readily realized by 3D printing and lithographic technologies. We expect that our designs will be potentially useful for energy-saving materials, batteries and aerospace applications.","Time dependent STM has been used to evaluate step fluctuations as a function of temperature (300-450 K) on Ag(111) films grown on mica. The temporal correlation function scales as a power law in time, t^1/n with measured values of 1/n varying over a range of 0.19 pm 0.04 to 0.29 pm 0.04 with no dependence on temperature. The average value of 1/n = 0.24 pm 0.01 is consistent with step-edge diffusion limited fluctuations (n = z = 4, conserved noise). The magnitude of the time correlation function and the width of the fluctuations both scale with temperature with the same apparent activation energy of Eeff = 0.21 pm 0.02 eV, indicating that the correlation time is at most weakly temperature dependent. Direct analysis of the autocorrelation function confirms that the correlation time is at most weakly temperature dependent, and thus the apparent correlation length is strongly temperature dependent. This behavior can be reproduced by assuming that the apparent correlation length is governed by the longest wavelength of step fluctuations that can be sampled in the measurement time interval. Evaluation of the correlation time for previous measurements for Al/Si(111) (z =2) yields the same conclusion about measurement time interval. In both cases the ratio of the measurement time to the effective correlation time is on the order of 10.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Optimized evolution of networks for principal eigenvector localization,Families of line-graphs and their quantization,False,"Network science is increasingly being developed to get new insights about behavior and properties of complex systems represented in terms of nodes and interactions. One useful approach is investigating localization properties of eigenvectors having diverse applications including disease-spreading phenomena in underlying networks. In this work, we evolve an initial random network with an edge rewiring optimization technique considering the inverse participation ratio as a fitness function. The evolution process yields a network having localized principal eigenvector. We analyze various properties of the optimized networks and those obtained at the intermediate stage. Our investigations reveal the existence of few special structural features of such optimized networks including the presence of a set of edges which are necessary for the localization, and rewiring only one of them leads to a complete delocalization of the principal eigenvector. Our investigation reveals that PEV localization is not a consequence of a single network property, and preferably requires co-existence of various distinct structural as well as spectral features.",Any directed graph G with N vertices and J edges has an associated line-graph L(G) where the J edges form the vertices of L(G). We show that the non-zero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices are the same for all graphs of such a family L^n(G).

Final-state interactions in two-nucleon knockout reactions,Pion scattering and electro-production on nucleons in the resonance region in chiral quark models,False,"Background: Exclusive two-nucleon knockout after electroexcitation of nuclei ($A(e,e'NN)$ in brief) is considered to be a primary source of information about short-range correlations (SRC) in nuclei. For a proper interpretation of the data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled. Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive $A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass region. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role of FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a ""small"" and ""large"" coverage of the available phase space. Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive $(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on ""free"" nucleon pairs, drops from $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb. For all considered kinematics, the mass dependence of the $T^{pN}_{A}$ can be captured by the power law $T^{pN}_{A} \propto A^{- \lambda}$ with $ 0.4 \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 0.5 $. Apart from an overall reduction factor, we find that FSI only modestly affects the distinct features of SRC-driven $A(e,e'pN)$ which are dictated by the c.m. distribution of close-proximity pairs. Conclusion: The SCX mechanisms represent a relatively small (order of a few percent) contribution of SRC-driven $A(e,e'pN)$ processes. The mass dependence of FSI effects in exclusive $A(e,e'pN)$ can be captured in a robust power law and is in agreement with the predictions obtained in a toy model.","Pion scattering and electro-production amplitudes have been computed in a coupled-channel framework incorporating quasi-bound quark-model states, based on the Cloudy Bag model.

Radial flow of kaon mesons in heavy ion reactions,Measurement of GEp/GMp in ep -> ep to Q2 = 5.6 GeV2,False,"This work investigates the collective motion of kaons in heavy ion reactions at SIS energies (about 1-2 GeV/nucleon). A radial collective flow of $K^+$ mesons is predicted to exist in central Au + Au collisions, which manifests in a characteristic ""shoulder-arm"" shape of the transverse mass spectrum of the midrapidity $K^+$ mesons. The $K^+$ radial flow arises from the repulsive $K^+$ mean field in nuclear matter. In spite of a strong reabsorption and rescattering the attractive $K^-$ mean field leads as well to a collective radial flow of $K^-$ mesons. The $K^-$ radial flow, however, is different from that of $K^+$ mesons and can be observed by a characteristic ""concave"" structure of the transverse mass spectrum of the $K^-$ mesons emitted at midrapidity.

Wafer-level substrate-free low-stress silicon nitride platform for THz metadevices and monolithically integrated narrowband metamaterial absorbers,A Database for Storing the Results of Material Radiopurity Measurements,False,"The implementation of terahertz (THz) wafer-level metadevices is critical to advance the science for applications including (I) integrated focal plane array which can image for biology and (II) integrated narrowband absorbers for high spectral resolution THz spectroscopy. Substantial progress has been made in the development of THz metamaterials; however, a wafer-level low-stress THz metadevices platform remains a challenge. This paper experimentally demonstrates a substrate-free THz metadevices platform adopting engineered Si-rich and low-stress silicon nitride (SiNx) thin films, achieving an extensive THz transparency up to f = 2.5 THz. A new analytical model is first reported from the Lorentz model that can accurately predict spectral responses of metal insulator metal (MIM) metamaterial absorbers. The model is experimentally validated in the THz range and exploited for the first demonstration of a THz absorber, which exhibits performance approaching the predicted results. Our results show that the wafer-level SiNx platform will accelerate the development of large-scale, sophisticated substrate-free THz metadevices.

Vector-Boson Fusion Higgs Pair Production at N$^3$LO,(Pre-)Hilbert spaces in twistor quantization,False,"We calculate the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) QCD corrections to vector-boson fusion (VBF) Higgs pair production in the limit in which there is no partonic exchange between the two protons. We show that the inclusive cross section receives negligible corrections at this order, while the scale variation uncertainties are reduced by a factor four. We present differential distributions for the transverse momentum and rapidity of the final state Higgs bosons, and show that there is almost no kinematic dependence to the third order corrections. Finally we study the impact of deviations from the Standard Model in the trilinear Higgs coupling, and show that the structure of the higher order corrections does not depend on the self-coupling. These results are implemented in the latest release of the proVBFH-incl program.","In twistor theory, the canonical quantization procedure, called twistor quantization, is performed with the twistor operators represented as \hat{Z}^{A}=Z^{A}(\in C) and \hat{\bar{Z}}_{A}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial Z^{A}}. However, it has not been clarified what kind of function spaces this representation is valid in. In the present paper, we try to find appropriate (pre-)Hilbert spaces in which the above representation is realized as an adjoint pair of operators. To this end, we define an inner product for the helicity eigenfunctions by an integral over the product space of the circular space S^{1} and the upper half of projective twistor space. Using this inner product, we define a Hilbert space in some particular case and indefinite-metric pre-Hilbert spaces in other particular cases, showing that the above- mentioned representation is valid in these spaces.

We present a new code, Slurm, which implements the classic particle-in-cell algorithm for modeling magnetized fluids and plasmas. It features particle volume evolution which damps the numerical finite grid instability, and allows modeling of key physical instabilities such as Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor. The magnetic field in Slurm is handled via the electromagnetic vector potential carried by particles.

"Attractive Inverse Square Potential, U(1) Gauge, and Winding Transitions",Superconductivity without inversion and time-reversal symmetries,False,"The inverse square potential arises in a variety of different quantum phenomena, yet notoriously it must be handled with care: it suffers from pathologies rooted in the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. We show that its recently studied conformality-breaking corresponds to an infinitely smooth winding-unwinding topological transition for the {\it classical} statistical mechanics of a one-dimensional system: this describes the the tangling/untangling of floppy polymers under a biasing torque. When the ratio between torque and temperature exceeds a critical value the polymer undergoes tangled oscillations, with an extensive winding number. At lower torque or higher temperature the winding number per unit length is zero. Approaching criticality, the correlation length of the order parameter---the extensive winding number---follows a Kosterlitz-Thouless type law. The model is described by the Wilson line of a (0+1) $U(1)$ gauge theory, and applies to the tangling/untangling of floppy polymers and to the winding/diffusing kinetics in diffusion-convection-reactions.","The traditional symmetries that protect superconductivity are time-reversal and inversion. Here, we examine the minimal symmetries protecting superconductivity in two dimensions and find that time-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry are not required, and having a combination of either symmetry with a mirror operation on the basal plane is sufficient. We classify superconducting states stabilized by these two symmetries, when time-reversal and inversion symmetries are not present, and provide realistic minimal models as examples. Interestingly, several experimentally realized systems, such as transition metal dichalcogenides and the two-dimensional Rashba system belong to this category, when subject to an applied magnetic field.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Jet azimuthal angle correlations in the production of a Higgs boson pair plus two jets at hadron colliders,Inertial and gravitational effects on a geonium atom,False,"Azimuthal angle correlations of two jets in the process $pp\to HHjj$ are studied. The loop induced $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^4 \alpha_{}^2)$ gluon fusion (GF) sub-process and the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{}^4)$ weak boson fusion (WBF) sub-process are considered. The GF sub-process exhibits strong correlations in the azimuthal angles $\phi_{1,2}^{}$ of the two jets measured from the production plane of the Higgs boson pair and the difference between these two angles $\phi_1^{}-\phi_2^{}$, and a very small correlation in the sum of them $\phi_1^{}+\phi_2^{}$. The impact of using a finite top mass $m_t^{}$ value on the correlations is found crucial. The transverse momentum of the Higgs boson can be used to enhance or suppress the correlations. The impact of a non-standard value for the triple Higgs self-coupling on the correlations is found much smaller than that on other observables, such as the invariant mass of the two Higgs bosons. The peak shifts of the azimuthal angle distributions reflect the magnitude of parity violation in the $gg\to HH$ amplitude and the dependence of the distributions on parity violating phases is analytically clarified. The WBF sub-process also produces correlated distributions and it is found that they are not induced by the quantum effect of the intermediate weak bosons but mainly by a kinematic effect. This kinematic effect is a characteristic feature of the WBF sub-process and is not observed in the GF sub-process. It is found that the correlations are different in the GF and in the WBF sub-processes. As part of the process dependent information, they will be helpful in the analyses of both the GF sub-process and the WBF sub-process at the LHC.","We reveal all linear order inertial and gravitational effects on a non-relativistic Dirac particle (mass $m$) on the Earth up to the order of $1/m$ in the Foldy-Wouthuysen-like expansion. Applying the result to Penning trap experiments where a Dirac particle experiences the cyclotron motion and the spin precession in a cavity, i.e., a geonium atom, we study modifications to the $g$-factor of such as the electron. It is shown that each correction from gravity has different dependence on the cyclotron frequency and the mass $m$. Therefore, their magnitude change depending on situations. In a particular case of an electron $g$-factor measurement, the dominant correction to the observed $g$-factor comes from effects of the Earth's rotation, which is $\delta g / 2 \simeq 5.2 \times 10^{-17}$. It may be detectable in the near future.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Low-energy effective Hamiltonian involving spin-orbit coupling in Silicene and Two-Dimensional Germanium and Tin,The phase diagram of the multi-dimensional Anderson localization via analytic determination of Lyapunov exponents,False,"Starting from the symmetry aspects and tight-binding method in combination with first-principles calculation, we systematically derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian involving spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for silicene, which is very general because this Hamiltonian applies to not only the silicene itself but also the low-buckled counterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn, as well as graphene when the structure returns to the planar geometry. The effective Hamitonian is the analogue to the first graphene quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) Hamiltonian. Similar to graphene model, the effective SOC in low-buckled geometry opens a gap at Dirac points and establishes QSHE. The effective SOC actually contains first order in the atomic intrinsic SOC strength $\xi_{0}$, while such leading order contribution of SOC vanishes in planar structure. Therefore, silicene as well as low-buckled counterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn has much larger gap opened by effective SOC at Dirac points than graphene due to low-buckled geometry and larger atomic intrinsic SOC strength. Further, the more buckled is the structure, the greater is the gap. Therefore, QSHE can be observed in low-buckled Si, Ge, and Sn systems in an experimentally accessible temperature regime. In addition, the Rashba SOC in silicene is intrinsic due to its own low-buckled geometry, which vanishes at Dirac point $K$, while has nonzero value with $\vec{k}$ deviation from the $K$ point. Therefore, the QSHE in silicene is robust against to the intrinsic Rashba SOC.","The method proposed by the present authors to deal analytically with the problem of Anderson localization via disorder [J.Phys.: Condens. Matter {\bf 14} (2002) 13777] is generalized for higher spatial dimensions D. In this way the generalized Lyapunov exponents for diagonal correlators of the wave function, $<\psi^2_{n,\mathbf{m}}>$, can be calculated analytically and exactly. This permits to determine the phase diagram of the system. For all dimensions $D > 2$ one finds intervals in the energy and the disorder where extended and localized states coexist: the metal-insulator transition should thus be interpreted as a first-order transition. The qualitative differences permit to group the systems into two classes: low-dimensional systems ($2\leq D \leq 3$), where localized states are always exponentially localized and high-dimensional systems ($D\geq D_c=4$), where states with non-exponential localization are also formed. The value of the upper critical dimension is found to be $D_0=6$ for the Anderson localization problem; this value is also characteristic of a related problem - percolation.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

A study of cascading failures in real and synthetic power grid topologies using DC power flows,Experience with the AHCAL Calibration System in the Test Beam,False,"Using the linearized DC power flow model, we study cascading failures and their spatial and temporal properties in the US Western Interconnect (USWI) power grid. We also introduce the preferential Degree And Distance Attachment (DADA) model, with similar degree distributions, resistances, and currents to the USWI. We investigate the behavior of both grids resulting from the failure of a single line. We find that the DADA model and the USWI model react very similarly to that failure, and that their blackout characteristics resemble each other. In many cases, the failure of a single line can cause cascading failures, which impact the entire grid. We characterize the resilience of the grid by three parameters, the most important of which is tolerance ${\alpha}$, which is the ratio of the maximal load a line can carry to its initial load. We characterize a blackout by its yield, which we define as the ratio of the final to the initial consumed currents. We find that if ${\alpha}\leq2$, the probability of a large blackout occurring is very small. By contrast, in a broad range of $1 < {\alpha} < 2$, the initial failure of a single line can result, with a high probability, in cascading failures leading to a massive blackout with final yield less than 80%. The yield has a bimodal distribution typical of a first-order transition, i.e., the failure of a randomly selected line leads either to an insignificant current reduction or to a major blackout. We find that there is a latent period in the development of major blackouts during which few lines are overloaded, and the yield remains high. The duration of this latent period is proportional to the tolerance. The existence of the latent period suggests that intervention during early time steps of a cascade can significantly reduce the risk of a major blackout.",We present herein our experience with the calibration system in the CALICE AHCAL prototype in the test beam and discuss characterizations of the SiPM response curves.,Physics and Society,"Physics and society focuses on structure, dynamics and collective behavior of societies and groups (human or otherwise).

Charmed Pseudoscalar and Vector Mesons: a Comprehensive QCD Sum-Rule View of Their Decay Constants,Cluster Estimates and Analytic Wavefunctions,False,"In spite of undeniable similarities of the applied techniques, somewhat different challenges are encountered when extracting, from QCD sum rules derived from two-point correlators of appropriate interpolating heavy-light quark currents, the decay constants of charmed mesons of pseudoscalar nature, on the one hand, or of vector nature, on the other hand. This observation justifies a rather careful reassessment of the corresponding results.","The Tomita-Takesaki modular theory is used to establish a cluster estimate extending and modifying that of Thomas and Wichmann, so as to extend it to regions within which the relevant observables are not necessarily spacelike separated.

Recent results on two-particle correlations in ALICE,Open and hidden charm in proton-nucleus and heavy-ion collisions,False,"The discovery of correlations between particles separated by several units of pseudorapidity in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions, reminiscent of structures observed in Pb-Pb collisions, was a challenge to traditional ideas about collectivity in heavy ion collisions. In order to further explore long-range correlations and provide information to theoretical models, correlations between forward trigger muons and mid-rapidity associated hadrons were measured in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mbox{NN}}} = 5.02~\mbox{TeV}$. The results demonstrate that the nearside and awayside ridges extend to $\Delta\eta \sim \pm 5$ and that the $v_2$ of muons, obtained from subtracting the correlation functions in high- and low-multiplicity events, is $(16\pm6)\%$ higher in the Pb-going than in the p-going direction. The results are compared with AMPT simulations.","We review the collectivity and the suppression pattern of charmed mesons - produced in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at SPS (158 AGeV) and RHIC energies (21 ATeV) - in comparison to dynamical and thermal models. In particular, we examine the charmonium `melting' and the `comover dissociation' scenarios - implemented in a microscopic transport approach - in comparison to the available data from the SPS and RHIC. The analysis shows that the dynamics of c, c-bar quarks at RHIC are dominated by partonic or `pre-hadronic' interactions in the strongly coupled plasma stage. Both the `charmonium melting' and the hadronic `comover absorption and recreation model' are found, however, to be compatible with the experimental observation at SPS energies; the experimental ratio of Psi'/J/Psi versus centrality clearly favors the `hadronic comover' scenario. We find that the collective flow of charm in the purely hadronic Hadron-String Dynamics (HSD) transport appears compatible with the data at SPS energies, but substantially underestimates the data at top RHIC energies. Thus, the large elliptic flow v2 of D-mesons and the low R_AA(p_T) of J/Psi seen experimentally have to be attributed to early interactions of non-hadronic degrees of freedom. Simultaneously, we observe that non-hadronic interactions are mandatory in order to describe the narrowing of the J/Psi rapidity distribution from pp to central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy. We demonstrate additionally that the strong quenching of low-pT J/Psi's in central Au+Au collisions indicates that a large fraction of final J/Psi mesons is created by a coalescence mechanism close to the phase boundary.

Novel Heavy Quark Phenomena in QCD,Electroproduction of Dijets at Small Jet Separation,False,"Heavy quarks provide a new dimension to QCD, allowing tests of fundamental theory, the nature of color confinement, and the production of new exotic multiquark states. I also discuss novel explanations for several apparently anomalous experimental results, such as the large $t \bar t$ forward-backward asymmetry observed in $p \bar p$ colisions at the Tevatron, the large rates for $\gamma$ or $Z$ plus high-$p_T$ charm jets observed at the Tevatron, the strong nuclear absorption of the $J/\psi$ observed in $pA$ collisions at the LHC, as well as fixed target experiments at high $x_F$. Precision measurements of the heavy quark distribution in hadrons at high $x$ are needed since intrinsic heavy quarks can play an important role in high $x$ phenomenology as well as predicting a new mechanism for high-$x_F$ Higgs production. The role of multi-parton interactions, such as di-gluon initiated subprocesses for forward quarkonium hadroproduction, is discussed. I also briefly discuss a new approach to the QCD confinement potential and the origin of the QCD mass scale based on AdS/QCD, light-front holography and a unique extension of conformal theory. The renormalization scale ambiguity can be eliminated at finite orders in pQCD using the scheme-independent PMC procedure, thus increasing the precision of predictions and eliminating an unnecessary source of theoretical systematic error.","Dijet production in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) in the range 150 < Q^2 < 35000 GeV^2 has been measured by the H1 collaboration using the Durham jet algorithm in the laboratory frame.

Dynamics of clade diversification on the morphological hypercube,Spatiotemporal dissipative solitons and vortices in a multi-transverse-mode fiber laser,False,"Understanding the relationship between taxonomic and morphological changes is important in identifying the reasons for accelerated morphological diversification early in the history of animal phyla. Here, a simple general model describing the joint dynamics of taxonomic diversity and morphological disparity is presented and applied to the data on the diversification of blastozoans. I show that the observed patterns of deceleration in clade diversification can be explicable in terms of the geometric structure of the morphospace and the effects of extinction and speciation on morphological disparity without invoking major declines in the size of morphological transitions or taxonomic turnover rates. The model allows testing of hypotheses about patterns of diversification and estimation of rates of morphological evolution. In the case of blastozoans, I find no evidence that major changes in evolutionary rates and mechanisms are responsible for the deceleration of morphological diversification seen during the period of this clade's expansion. At the same time, there is evidence for a moderate decline in overall rates of morphological diversification concordant with a major change (from positive to negative values) in the clade's growth rate.","We introduce a model for spatiotemporal modelocking in multimode fiber lasers, which is based on the (3+1)-dimensional cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (cGLE) with conservative and dissipative nonlinearities and a 2-dimensional transverse trapping potential. Systematic numerical analysis reveals a variety of stable nonlinear modes, including stable fundamental solitons and breathers, as well as solitary vortices with winding number $n=1$, while vortices with $n=2$ are unstable, splitting into persistently rotating bound states of two unitary vortices.

Correlation Functions and Cumulants in Elliptic Flow Analysis,Process-independent effective coupling and the pion structure function,False,"We consider various methods of flow analysis in heavy ion collisions and compare experimental data on corresponding observables to the predictions of our saturation model proposed earlier. We demonstrate that, due to the nature of the standard flow analysis, azimuthal distribution of particles with respect to reaction plane determined from the second order harmonics should always be proportional to $\cos 2(\phi-\Psi_R)$ independent of the physical origin of particle correlations (flow or non-flow). The amplitude of this distribution is always physical and proportional to $v_2$. Two-particle correlations analysis is therefore a more reliable way of extracting the shape of physical azimuthal anisotropy. We demonstrate that two-particle correlation functions generated in our minijet model of particle production are in good agreement with the data reported by PHENIX. We discuss the role of non-flow correlations in the cumulant flow analysis and demonstrate using a simple example that if the flow is weak, higher order cumulants analysis does not significantly reduce the contribution of non-flow correlations to elliptic flow observable $v_2$ in RHIC data.","We sketch the calculation of the pion structure functions within the DSE framework, following two alternative albeit consistent approaches, and discuss then their QCD evolution, the running driven by an effective charge, from a hadronic scale up to any larger one accessible to experiment.",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

Discrete surface solitons in two-dimensional anisotropic photonic lattices,Examples of Synchronization in Discrete Chaotic Systems,False,"We study nonlinear surface modes in two-dimensional {\em anisotropic} periodic photonic lattices and demonstrate that, in a sharp contrast to one-dimensional discrete surface solitons, the mode threshold power is lower at the surface, and two-dimensional discrete solitons can be generated easier near the lattice corners and edges.

Complex central structures suggest complex evolutionary paths for barred S0 galaxies,The mean free path of hydrogen ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization,False,"We investigate three barred lenticular galaxies (NGC 2681, NGC 3945 and NGC 4371) which were previously reported to have complex central structures but without a detailed structural analysis of these galaxies' high-resolution data. We have therefore performed four- to six-component (pseudo-)bulge/disk/bar/ring/point source) decompositions of the composite (Hubble Space Telescope plus ground-based) surface brightness profiles. We find that NGC 2681 hosts three bars, while NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 are double- and single-barred galaxies, respectively, in agreement with past isophotal analysis. We find that the bulges in these galaxies are compact, and have S\'ersic indices of $n\sim 2.2 - 3.6$ and stellar masses of $M_{*}$ $\sim 0.28\times10^{10} - 1.1\times10^{10} M_{\sun}$. NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 have intermediate-scale `pseudo-bulges' that are well described by a S\'ersic model with low $n \la 0.5$ instead of an exponential ($n=1$) profile as done in the past. We measure emission line fluxes enclosed within 9 different elliptical apertures, finding that NGC 2681 has a LINER-type emission inside $R \sim 3\arcsec$, but the emission line due to star formation is significant when aperture size is increased. In contrast, NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 have composite (AGN plus star forming)- and LINER-type emissions inside and outside $R \sim 2\arcsec$, respectively. Our findings suggest that the three galaxies have experienced a complex evolutionary path. The bulges appear to be consequences of an earlier violent merging event while subsequent disk formation via gas accretion and bar-driven perturbations may account for the build-up of pseudo-bulges, bars, rings and point sources.","We use the Aurora radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to study the mean free path (MFP) for hydrogen ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization. We directly measure the MFP by averaging the distance 1 Ry photons travel before reaching an optical depth of unity along random lines-of-sight. During reionization the free paths tend to end in neutral gas with densities near the cosmic mean, while after reionizaton the end points tend to be overdense but highly ionized. Despite the increasing importance of discrete, over-dense systems, the cumulative contribution of systems with $N_{\rm{HI}} \lesssim 10^{16.5}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$ suffices to drive the MFP at $z \approx 6$, while at earlier times higher column densities are more important. After reionization the typical size of HI systems is close to the local Jeans length, but during reionization it is much larger. The mean free path for photons originating close to galaxies, $\rm{MFP_{gal}}$, is much smaller than the cosmic MFP. After reionization this enhancement can remain significant up to starting distances of $\sim 1$ comoving Mpc. During reionization, however, $\rm{MFP_{gal}}$ for distances $\sim 10^2 - 10^3$ comoving kpc typically exceeds the cosmic MFP. These findings have important consequences for models that interpret the intergalactic MFP as the distance escaped ionizing photons can travel from galaxies before being absorbed and may cause them to under-estimate the required escape fraction from galaxies, and/or the required emissivity of ionizing photons after reionization.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Stochasticity of Road Traffic Dynamics: Comprehensive Linear and Nonlinear Time Series Analysis on High Resolution Freeway Traffic Records,Student Use of a Single Lecture Video in a Flipped Introductory Mechanics Course,False,"The dynamical properties of road traffic time series from North-Rhine Westphalian motorways are investigated. The article shows that road traffic dynamics is well described as a persistent stochastic process with two fixed points representing the freeflow (non-congested) and the congested state regime. These traffic states have different statistical properties, with respect to waiting time distribution, velocity distribution and autocorrelation. Logdifferences of velocity records reveal non-normal, obviously leptocurtic distribution. Further, linear and nonlinear phase-plane based analysis methods yield no evidence for any determinism or deterministic chaos to be involved in traffic dynamics on shorter than diurnal time scales. Several Hurst-exponent estimators indicate long-range dependence for the free flow state. Finally, our results are not in accordance to the typical heuristic fingerprints of self-organized criticality. We suggest the more simplistic assumption of a non-critical phase transition between freeflow and congested traffic.","In the Fall of 2013, Georgia Tech offered a 'flipped' calculus-based introductory mechanics class as an alternative to the traditional large-enrollment lecture class.

Energetic Particle Pressure at Interplanetary Shocks: STEREO-A Observations,Kinetic fluctuations in the inhomogeneous plasma,False,"We study periods of elevated energetic particle intensities observed by STEREO-A when the partial pressure exerted by energetic ($\geq$83 keV) protons ($P_{EP}$) is larger than the pressure exerted by the interplanetary magnetic field ($P_{B}$). In the majority of cases, these periods are associated with the passage of interplanetary shocks. Periods when $P_{EP}$ exceeds $P_{B}$ by more than one order of magnitude are observed in the upstream region of fast interplanetary shocks where depressed magnetic field regions coincide with increases of the energetic particle intensities. When solar wind parameters are available, $P_{EP}$ also exceeds the pressure exerted by the solar wind thermal population ($P_{TH}$). Prolonged periods ($>$12 h) with both $P_{EP}$$>$$P_{B}$ and $P_{EP}$$>$$P_{TH}$ may also occur when energetic particles accelerated by an approaching shock encounter a region well-upstream of the shock characterized by low magnetic field magnitude and tenuous solar wind density. Quasi-exponential increases of the sum $P_{SUM}$=$P_{B}$+$P_{TH}$+$P_{EP}$ are observed in the immediate upstream region of the shocks regardless of individual changes in $P_{EP}$, $P_{B}$ and $P_{TH}$, indicating a coupling between $P_{EP}$ and the pressure of the background medium characterized by $P_{B}$ and $P_{TH}$. The quasi-exponential increase of $P_{SUM}$ implies a convected exponential radial gradient $\partial{P_{SUM}}/\partial{r}$$>$0 that results in an outward force applied to the plasma upstream of the shock. This force can be maintained by the mobile energetic particles streaming upstream of the shocks that, in the most intense events, drive electric currents able to generate diamagnetic cavities and depressed solar wind density regions.","Using the Langevin approach and the multiscale technique, a kinetic theory of the time and space nonlocal fluctuations in the collisional plasma is constructed. In local equilibrium a generalized version of the Callen-Welton theorem is derived. It is shown that not only the dissipation but also the time and space derivatives of the dispersion determine the amplitude and the width of the spectrum lines of the electrostatic field fluctuations, as well as the form factor. There appear significant differences with respect to the non-uniform plasma. In the kinetic regime the form factor is more sensible to space gradient than the spectral function of the electrostatic field fluctuations. As a result of the inhomogeneity, these proprieties became asymmetric with respect to the inversion of the frequency sign. The differences in amplitude of peaks could become a new tool to diagnose slow time and space variations in the plasma.",Space Physics,"Space physics focuses on space plasma physics. Heliophysics.

"Dark energy, chaotic fields, and fundamental constants",$\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ Physics at BES-III,False,"To explain the currently observed accelerated expansion of the universe, a large number of different theoretical models are presently being discussed. In one way or another, all of these contain `new physics', though at different levels. The big question is how to select out of infinitely many possible models the right one. Here we discuss a possibility that has so far been somewhat neglected, namely that the new physics underlying dark energy arises out of a gravitationally active amendment of the electroweak and strong sector of the standard model. This amendment basically consists of a rapidly fluctuating gravitationally active dynamics of vacuum fluctuations with a cutoff of the order of the neutrino mass scale. We consider a concrete model for this based on second-quantized self-interacting scalar fields, which evolve in a chaotic way. It is shown that expectations with respect to the chaotic dynamics yield statements on the observed numerical values of the electroweak coupling constants with amazing precision, thus providing evidence for the physical relevance of this model.","Decays of both $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ provide very useful information in our understanding of low-energy QCD, and experimental signatures for these decays would be extremely helpful at BES-III.

We utilize the medium-resolution Galileo regional maps (RegMaps), as well as high-resolution regions, digital elevation models derived from albedo-controlled photoclinometry, and in some cases stereo-controlled photoclinometry. While limited in extent, the high-resolution images are extremely valuable for detecting smaller features and for overall geomorphological analysis. A peak in the size-distribution for all features is found at ~5-6 km in diameter and no pits smaller than 3.3 km in diameter were found in high resolution images. Additionally, there is a trend for larger pits to be deeper, and larger uplifts to be higher. Our data support a diapiric or intracrustal sill interpretation (as opposed to purely non-intrusive, melt-through models) and place a lower limit on ice shell thickness at the time of feature formation of 3-to-8 km, assuming isostasy and depending on the composition of the ice and underlying ocean.","I introduce $Profiler$, a new, user-friendly program written in $Python$ and designed to analyse the radial surface brightness profiles of galaxies. With an intuitive graphical user interface, $Profiler$ can accurately model a wide range of galaxies and galaxy components, such as elliptical galaxies, the bulges of spiral and lenticular galaxies, nuclear sources, discs, bars, rings, spiral arms, etc., with a variety of parametric functions routinely employed in the field (S\'ersic, core-S\'ersic, exponential, Gaussian, Moffat and Ferrers). In addition to these, $Profiler$ can employ the broken exponential model (relevant for disc truncations or antitruncations) and two special cases of the edge-on disc model: namely along the major axis (in the disc plane) and along the minor axis (perpendicular to the disc plane). $Profiler$ is optimised to work with galaxy light profiles obtained from isophotal measurements which capture radial gradients in the ellipticity, position angle and Fourier harmonic profiles of the isophotes, and are thus often better at capturing the total light than two-dimensional image-fitting programs. Additionally, the one-dimensional approach is generally less computationally expensive and more stable. In $Profiler$, the convolution of either circular or elliptical models with the point spread function is performed in two-dimensions, and offers a choice between Gaussian, Moffat or a user-provided data vector (a table of intensity values as a function of radius) for the point spread function. I demonstrate $Profiler$'s features and operation by decomposing three case-study galaxies: the cored elliptical galaxy NGC 3348, the nucleated dwarf Seyfert I galaxy Pox 52, and NGC 2549, a structurally complex, double-barred galaxy which also displays a Type II truncated disc viewed edge-on. $Profiler$ is freely available at: https://github.com/BogdanCiambur/PROFILER",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"Earth and planetary astrophysics focuses on interplanetary medium, planetary physics, planetary astrobiology, extrasolar planets, comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

Polyelectrolyte-Compression Forces between Spherical DNA Brushes,Discontinuity of capacitance at the onset of surface superconductivity,False,"Optical tweezers are employed to measure the forces of interaction within a single pair of DNA-grafted colloids in dependence of the molecular weight of the DNA-chains, and the concentration and valence of the surrounding ionic medium. The resulting forces are short-range and set in as the surface-to-surface distance between the colloidal cores reaches the value of the brush height. The measured force-distance dependence is analyzed by means of a theoretical treatment based on the compression of the chains on the surface of the opposite-lying colloid. Quantitative agreement with the experiment is obtained for all parameter combinations.",The effect of the magnetic field on a capacitor with a superconducting electrode is studied within the Ginzburg-Landau approach. It is shown that the capacitance has a discontinuity at the onset of the surface superconductivity $B_{\rm c3}$ which is expressed as a discontinuity in the penetration depth of the electric field into metals.

Near-threshold properties of the electronic density of layered quantum-dots,Effective elastic moduli of composites with a strongly disordered host material,False,"We present a way to manipulate an electron trapped in a layered quantum dot based on near-threshold properties of one-body potentials. We show that potentials with a simple global parameter allows the manipulation of the wave function changing its spatial extent. This phenomenon seems to be fairly general and could be implemented using current quantum-dot quantum wells technologies and materials if a proper layered quantum dot is designed. The layered quantum dot under consideration is similar to a quantum-dot quantum well device, i.e. consists of a spherical core surrounded by successive layers of different materials. The number of layers and the constituent material are chosen to highlight the near-threshold properties. In particular we show that the near-threshold phenomena can be observed using an effective mass approximation model that describes the layered quantum dot which is consistent with actual experimental parameters.","The local elastic properties of strongly disordered host material are investigated using the theory of correlated random matrices. A significant increase in stiffness is shown in the interfacial region, which thickness depends on the strength of disorder. It is shown that this effect plays a crucial role in nanocomposites, in which interfacial regions are formed around each nanoparticle. The studied interfacial effect can significantly increase the influence of nanoparticles on the macroscopic stiffness of nanocomposites.

Searching for orbital decay in a heartbeat star system KIC 3766353,Polar Ring Galaxies in the Galaxy Zoo,False,"Theory suggests that the orbits of a large fraction of binary systems, including planet-star binary systems, shrink by few orders of magnitude after formation. But so far, only one hot Jupiter with tidally-driven orbital decay has been found by transit timing variations. We propose to search for orbital decay companions in heartbeat star systems because the orbital angular momentum is effectively transferred to the host star causing tidal dissipation. KIC 3766353 is one of the heartbeat stars with tidally excited oscillations. We acquired the primary and the secondary eclipse time variations from the \textit{Kepler} photometric light curves. Timing analysis shows that KIC 3766353 is a hierarchical triple system with a hidden third body and a red dwarf (mass $0.35\ M_{\odot}$, radius $0.34\ R_{\odot}$) in its inner orbit. The minimum mass of the third body is $\sim 0.26 \ M_{\odot}$, and the distance from the inner orbital is $\sim 111.4 \ R_{\odot}$. The period decay rate of the red dwarf is approximately 358 ms yr$^{-1}$. The combined effects of the light-travel time and the orbital decay lead to the observed timing variations. Future monitoring with a long time base-line observations is required to delve into the contributions of these two effects.","We report observations of 16 candidate polar ring galaxies (PRGs) identified by the Galaxy Zoo project in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database.

We analyze those correlators using the rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory (rS$\chi$PT), particular attention is paid to the bubble contribution. After chiral extrapolation, we obtain the physical $\kappa$ mass with $828\pm97$ MeV, which is within the recent experimental value $800\sim900$MeV.

Status of the New Research Facilty in Andrate - TO - and prospective for research,Effect of mass loss due to stellar winds on the formation of supermassive black hole seeds in dense nuclear star clusters,False,"We report briefly on the status of the new research facility in Andrate (TO) at 839 m above sea level. The structure will be built under the project ROAD073P2T, and will enable the development of major research project. Due to the high altitude, the transparency of the sky, cold, dry and windy at certain times of the year, exceptionally, the location of Andrate (TO) is indeed among the best places in the district of Ivrea (TO), to conduct observation of the sky, in the band U, B, V, R, I, Ir, Rc.","The observations of high redshifts quasars at $z\gtrsim 6$ have revealed that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of mass $\sim 10^9\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ were already in place within the first $\sim$ Gyr after the Big Bang. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses $10^{3-5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are potential seeds for these observed SMBHs. A possible formation channel of these SMSs is the interplay of gas accretion and runaway stellar collisions inside dense nuclear star clusters (NSCs). However, mass loss due to stellar winds could be an important limitation for the formation of the SMSs and affect the final mass. In this paper, we study the effect of mass loss driven by stellar winds on the formation and evolution of SMSs in dense NSCs using idealised N-body simulations. Considering different accretion scenarios, we have studied the effect of the mass loss rates over a wide range of metallicities $Z_\ast=[.001-1]\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$ and Eddington factors $f_{\rm Edd}=L_\ast/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}=0.5,0.7,\,\&\, 0.9$. For a high accretion rate of $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$, SMSs with masses $\gtrsim 10^3\MSun$ could be formed even in a high metallicity environment. For a lower accretion rate of $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$, SMSs of masses $\sim 10^{3-4}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed for all adopted values of $Z_\ast$ and $f_{\rm Edd}$, except for $Z_\ast=\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$ and $f_{\rm Edd}=0.7$ or 0.9. For Eddington accretion, SMSs of masses $\sim 10^3\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed in low metallicity environments with $Z_\ast\lesssim 0.01\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$.

Search for CP violation in $D^0\to\pi^-\pi^+\pi^0$ decays with the energy test,Kaon mixing and the charm mass,False,"A search for time-integrated CP violation in the Cabibbo-suppressed decay $D^0\to\pi^-\pi^+\pi^0$ is performed using for the first time an unbinned model-independent technique known as the energy test. Using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV, the world's best sensitivity to CP violation in this decay is obtained. The data are found to be consistent with the hypothesis of CP symmetry with a p-value of (2.6 +/- 0.5)%.","We study contributions to the Delta S=2 weak Chiral Lagrangian producing K0-K0bar mixing which are not enhanced by the charm mass. For the real part, these contributions turn out to be related to the box diagram with up quarks but, unlike in perturbation theory, they do not vanish in the limit m_u->0. They increase the leading contribution to the K_L-K_S mass difference by ~10%. This means that short distances amount to (90+-15)% of this mass difference. For the imaginary part, we find a correction to the lambda_c^2 m_c^2 term of -5% from the integration of charm, which is a small contribution to epsilon_K.

Seed Population Pre-Conditioning and Acceleration Observed by Parker Solar Probe,Revealing a full quantum ladder by nonlinear spectroscopy,False,"A series of solar energetic particle (SEP) events were observed at Parker Solar Probe (PSP) by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (\ISOIS) during the period from April 18, 2019 through April 24, 2019. The PSP spacecraft was located near 0.48 au from the Sun on Parker spiral field lines that projected out to 1 au within $\sim 25^\circ$ of near Earth spacecraft. These SEP events, though small compared to historically large SEP events, were amongst the largest observed thus far in the PSP mission and provide critical information about the space environment inside 1 au during SEP events. During this period the Sun released multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs). One of these CMEs observed was initiated on April 20, 2019 at 01:25 UTC, and the interplanetary CME (ICME) propagated out and passed over the PSP spacecraft. Observations by the Electromagnetic Fields Investigation (FIELDS) show that the magnetic field structure was mostly radial throughout the passage of the compression region and the plasma that followed, indicating that PSP did not directly observe a flux rope internal to the ICME, consistent with the location of PSP on the ICME flank. Analysis using relativistic electrons observed near Earth by the Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor (EPAM) on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) demonstrates the presence of electron seed populations (40--300 keV) during the events observed. The energy spectrum of the \ISOIS~ observed proton seed population below 1 MeV is close to the limit of possible stationary state plasma distributions out of equilibrium. \ISOIS~ observations reveal the \revise{enhancement} of seed populations during the passage of the ICME, which \revise{likely indicates a key part} of the pre-acceleration process that occurs close to the Sun.","Coherent two-dimensional spectroscopy in IR or visible region is very effective for studying correlations, energy relaxation/transfer pathways in complex multi-chromophore or multi-mode systems.

Conversion electrons used to monitor the energy scale of electron spectrometer near tritium endpoint - a simulation study,Predictions of covariant chiral perturbation theory for nucleon polarisabilities and polarised Compton scattering,False,"Measurements of the endpoint region of the tritium beta-decay spectrum provides good possibility to determine neutrino mass. This, however, needs a perfect monitoring of the spectrometer energy scale. A parallel measurement of electron line of known energy - in particular the 83mKr conversion K-line - may serve well to this purpose. The 83Rb decaying to 83mKr seems to be a very suitable radioactive source due to its halflife of 86.2 day.

The results for the scalar polarisabilities are in significant disagreement with semi-empirical analyses based on dispersion relations, however the results for the spin polarisabilities agree remarkably well. Results for proton Compton-scattering multipoles and polarised observables up to the Delta(1232) resonance region are presented too. The asymmetries $\Sigma_3$ and $\Sigma_{2x}$ reproduce the experimental data from LEGS and MAMI. Results for $\Sigma_{2z}$ agree with a recent sum rule evaluation in the forward kinematics. The asymmetry $\Sigma_{1z}$ near the pion production threshold shows a large sensitivity to chiral dynamics, but no data is available for this observable.

Charmed baryon resonances with heavy-quark spin symmetry,Towards the Finite Temperature Gluon Propagator in Landau Gauge Yang-Mills Theory,False,"Charmed baryon resonances that are generated dynamically are studied within a unitary baryon-meson coupled-channel model, which incorporates heavy-quark spin symmetry. The extension of the SU(3) Weinberg-Tomozawa chiral Lagrangian to SU(8) spin-flavor symmetry plus a suitable symmetry breaking is used. The model produces resonances with negative parity from s-wave interaction of pseudoscalar and vector mesons with $1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$ baryons. Some of our dynamically generated states can be readily assigned to resonances found experimentally, while others do not have a straightforward identification and require the compilation of more data and also refinements of the model.","Yang-Mills theories undergo a deconfining phase transition at a critical temperature. In lattice calculations the temporal Wilson loop and Z_3 order parameter show above this temperature a behavior typical of deconfinement.

This contribution describes the current status of an investigation of the finite temperature gluon propagator in Landau gauge. It analyzes the high temperature case.

Experimental and First principle calculation of Co_xNi_{(1-x)}Si solid solution structural stability,Polymer Principles of Protein Calorimetric Two-State Cooperativity,False,"We report the investigation of the structural stability of Co$_{(1-x)}$Ni$_x$Si monosilicides for $0<x<1$. As CoSi crystallizes in the FeSi-type structure (B20) and NiSi is stable in the MnP-type structure (B31), a complete set of samples has been synthesized and a systematic study of phase formation under different annealing conditions were carried out in order to understand the reason of such a structural transition when x goes from 0 to 1. This study has revealed a limit in the solubility of Ni in CoSi B20 structure of about 17.5 at.% and of Co in NiSi B31 phase of about 13 at.%. For $0.35<x<0.74$ both B20 and B31 phases are present in the sample at there respective limits of solubility. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility has also been measured revealing diamagnetic behaviors. Optimal structural parameters and phase stability of the solid solution have been investigated using self-consistent full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method (FP-LAPW) based on the density functional theory (DFT). This calculation well predicts the structural instability observed experimentally.","The experimental calorimetric two-state criterion requires the van't Hoff enthalpy $\Delta H_{\rm vH}$ around the folding/unfolding transition midpoint to be equal or very close to the calorimetric enthalpy $\Delta H_{\rm cal}$ of the entire transition. We use an analytical model with experimental parameters from chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 to elucidate the relationship among several different van't Hoff enthalpies used in calorimetric analyses. Under reasonable assumptions, the implications of these $\Delta H_{\rm vH}$'s being approximately equal to $\Delta H_{\rm cal}$ are equivalent: Enthalpic variations among denatured conformations in real proteins are much narrower than some previous lattice-model estimates, suggesting that the energy landscape theory ``folding to glass transition temperature ratio'' $T_{\rm f}/T_{\rm g}$ may exceed 6.0 for real calorimetrically two-state proteins. Several popular three-dimensional lattice protein models, with different numbers of residue types in their alphabets, are found to fall short of the high experimental standard for being calorimetrically two-state. Some models postulate a multiple-conformation native state with substantial pre-denaturational energetic fluctuations well below the unfolding transition temperature and/or predict a significant post-denaturational continuous conformational expansion of the denatured ensemble at temperatures well above the transition point.",Other Condensed Matter,Other condensed matter in physics focuses on topics that fall outside the scope of more specific categories.
Stability of Initial Glasma Fields,Helium halo nuclei from low-momentum interactions,False,"A system of gluon fields produced in the earliest phase of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, which is called `glasma', can be described in terms of classical fields. Initially there are chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields along the collision axis. A linear stability analysis of these fields is performed, assuming that the fields are space-time uniform. We apply Milne coordinates and the gauge condition which are usually used in studies of glasma. The chromoelectric field is in the Abelian configuration with the corresponding potential linearly depending on coordinates but the chromomagnetic field is in the nonAbelian configuration generated by the potential of non-commuting components. The chromomagnetic field is found to be unstable and the growth rate of the unstable mode is derived. Our findings are critically debated and confronted with the numerical simulations by Romatschke and Venugopalan who found that the evolving glasma is unstable due to the Weibel instability well-known in electromagnetic plasma.","We present ground-state energies of helium halo nuclei based on chiral low-momentum interactions, using the hyperspherical-harmonics method for 6He and coupled-cluster theory for 8He, with correct asymptotics for the extended halo structure.",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

Gas-liquid phase equilibrium in ionic fluids: Coulomb versus non-Coulomb interactions,Fast and scalable quantum information processing with two-electron atoms in optical tweezer arrays,False,"Using the collective variables theory, we study the effect of competition between Coulomb and dispersion forces on the gas-liquid phase behaviour of a model ionic fluid, i.e. a charge-asymmetric primitive model with additional short-range attractive interactions. Both the critical parameters and the coexistence envelope are calculated in a one-loop approximation as a function of the parameter $\alpha$ measuring the relative strength of the Coulomb to short-range interactions. We found the very narrow region of $\alpha$ bounded from the both sides by tricritical points which separates the models with ""nonionic"" and ""Coulombic"" phase behaviour. This is at variance with the result of available computer simulations where no tricritical point is found for the finely-discretized lattice version of the model.","Atomic systems, ranging from trapped ions to ultracold and Rydberg atoms, offer unprecedented control over both internal and external degrees of freedom at the single-particle level. They are considered among the foremost candidates for realizing quantum simulation and computation platforms that can outperform classical computers at specific tasks. In this work, we describe a realistic experimental toolbox for quantum information processing with neutral alkaline-earth-like atoms in optical tweezer arrays. In particular, we propose a comprehensive and scalable architecture based on a programmable array of alkaline-earth-like atoms, exploiting their electronic clock states as a precise and robust auxiliary degree of freedom, and thus allowing for efficient all-optical one- and two-qubit operations between nuclear spin qubits. The proposed platform promises excellent performance thanks to high-fidelity register initialization, rapid spin-exchange gates and error detection in readout.

Dynamics of Darwinian versus Baldwinian versus Lamarckian evolution,Topological Valley Hall Edge State Lasing,False,"In recent years, studies in epigenetic inheritance in biological systems as well as studies on evolution in non-biological systems e.g., machine learning and robotics, have reopened the discussion of non-Darwinian methods of evolutionary optimization. In this paper, the three most prominent classical evolutionary strategies Lamarckian, Darwinian, and Baldwinian are implemented and compared in an agent-based simulation. The dynamics of optimization and learning are studied in constant as well as in dynamic environments, both as single evolutionary strategy populations and as mixed evolutionary strategy populations. The three different agent types are implemented as simple objects that need to gather resources to replicate. The agent fitness is defined through a bitstring match between the agent and the environment and to replicate each agent needs to gather sufficient resources. To make a fair comparison between the three different evolutionary methods, we can assume that both the ability to learn within an individual's lifetime and the learning process itself require additional resources compared to an evolutionary process without lifetime learning. When all three strategies coexist and we vary the replication costs for the different strategies we find the following general pattern: The evolutionary advantage decreases for Lamarckian and Baldwinian strategies as their learning costs increase and/or as their relative replication costs increase compared to the Darwinian strategies, and in most situations the Baldwinian strategy performs in between the Darwinian and Lamarckian strategies. Finally, as our investigations emphasize the superiority of the Lamarckian strategy in most cases with low learning cost, it is interesting to note that a corresponding biological inheritance mechanism did not evolve, while the Lamarckian strategy is currently extensively used in technology applications.","Topological lasers based on topologically protected edge states offer unique features and enhanced robustness of operation in comparison with conventional lasers, even in the presence of disorder, edge deformation, and localized defects. Here we propose a new class of topological lasers arising from the valley Hall edge states, which does not require external magnetic fields or dynamical modulations of the device parameters. Specifically, topological lasing occurs at domain walls between two honeycomb waveguide arrays with broken spatial inversion symmetry. Two types of valley Hall edge lasing modes are found by shaping the gain landscape along the domain walls. In the presence of uniform losses and two-photon absorption, lasing in edge states results in the formation of stable nonlinear dissipative excitations localized on the edge of the structure, even if it has complex geometry and even if it is finite. Robustness of lasing states is demonstrated in both periodic and finite structures, where such states can circumvent sharp corners without scattering loss or radiation into the bulk. The photonic structure and mechanism proposed here for topological lasing is fundamentally different from those previously demonstrated topological lasers and can be used for fabrication of practical topological lasers of various geometries.",Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems,"Adaptation and self-organizing systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that exhibit adaptive behavior and self-organization.

Matter wave Fourier optics with a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas,Linking physics and algorithms in the random-field Ising model,False,"We demonstrate and characterize an experimental technique to directly image the momentum distribution of a strongly interacting two-dimensional quantum gas with high momentum resolution. We apply the principles of Fourier optics to investigate three main operations on the expanding gas: focusing, collimation and magnification. We focus the gas in the radial plane using a harmonic confining potential and thus gain access to the momentum distribution. We pulse a different harmonic potential to stop the rapid axial expansion which allows us to image the momentum distribution with high resolution. Additionally, we propose a method to magnify the mapped momentum distribution to access interesting momentum scales. All these techniques can be applied to a wide range of experiments and in particular to study many-body phases of quantum gases.","The energy landscape for the random-field Ising model (RFIM) is complex, yet algorithms such as the push-relabel algorithm exist for computing the exact ground state of an RFIM sample in time polynomial in the sample volume. Simulations were carried out to investigate the scaling properties of the push-relabel algorithm. The time evolution of the algorithm was studied along with the statistics of an auxiliary potential field. At very small random fields, the algorithm dynamics are closely related to the dynamics of two-species annihilation, consistent with fractal statistics for the distribution of minima in the potential (``height''). For $d=1,2$, a correlation length diverging at zero disorder sets a cutoff scale for the magnitude of the height field; our results are most consistent with a power-law correction to the exponential scaling of the correlation length with disorder in $d=2$. Near the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition in $d=3$, the time to find a solution diverges with a dynamic critical exponent of $z=0.93\pm0.06$ for a priority queue version and $z=0.43\pm0.06$ for a first-in first-out queue version of the algorithm. The links between the evolution of auxiliary fields in algorithmic time and the static physical properties of the RFIM ground state provide insight into the physics of the RFIM and a better understanding of how the algorithm functions.",Quantum Gases,"Quantum gases in condensed matter physics focuses on ultracold atomic and molecular gases, Bose-Einstein condensation, Feshbach resonances, spinor condensates, optical lattices, quantum simulation with cold atoms and molecules, and macroscopic interference phenomena."
SIDRA: a blind algorithm for signal detection in photometric surveys,"Synthetic CO, H2 and HI surveys of the Galactic 2nd Quadrant, and the properties of molecular gas",False,"We present the Signal Detection using Random-Forest Algorithm (SIDRA). SIDRA is a detection and classification algorithm based on the Machine Learning technique (Random Forest). The goal of this paper is to show the power of SIDRA for quick and accurate signal detection and classification. We first diagnose the power of the method with simulated light curves and try it on a subset of the Kepler space mission catalogue. We use five classes of simulated light curves (CONSTANT, TRANSIT, VARIABLE, MLENS and EB for constant light curves, transiting exoplanet, variable, microlensing events and eclipsing binaries, respectively) to analyse the power of the method. The algorithm uses four features in order to classify the light curves. The training sample contains 5000 light curves (1000 from each class) and 50000 random light curves for testing. The total SIDRA success ratio is $\geq 90\%$. Furthermore, the success ratio reaches 95 - 100$\%$ for the CONSTANT, VARIABLE, EB, and MLENS classes and 92$\%$ for the TRANSIT class with a decision probability of 60$\%$. Because the TRANSIT class is the one which fails the most, we run a simultaneous fit using SIDRA and a Box Least Square (BLS) based algorithm for searching for transiting exoplanets. As a result, our algorithm detects 7.5$\%$ more planets than a classic BLS algorithm, with better results for lower signal-to-noise light curves. SIDRA succeeds to catch 98$\%$ of the planet candidates in the Kepler sample and fails for 7$\%$ of the false alarms subset. SIDRA promises to be useful for developing a detection algorithm and/or classifier for large photometric surveys such as TESS and PLATO exoplanet future space missions.","We present CO, H2, HI and HISA distributions from a set of simulations of grand design spirals including stellar feedback, self-gravity, heating and cooling. We replicate the emission of the 2nd Galactic Quadrant by placing the observer inside the modelled galaxies and post process the simulations using a radiative transfer code, so as to create synthetic observations. We compare the synthetic datacubes to observations of the 2nd Quadrant of the Milky Way to test the ability of the current models to reproduce the basic chemistry of the Galactic ISM, as well as to test how sensitive such galaxy models are to different recipes of chemistry and/or feedback. We find that models which include feedback and self-gravity can reproduce the production of CO with respect to H2 as observed in our Galaxy, as well as the distribution of the material perpendicular to the Galactic plane. While changes in the chemistry/feedback recipes do not have a huge impact on the statistical properties of the chemistry in the simulated galaxies, we find that the inclusion of both feedback and self-gravity are crucial ingredients, as our test without feedback failed to reproduce all of the observables. Finally, even though the transition from H2 to CO seems to be robust, we find that all models seem to underproduce molecular gas, and have a lower molecular to atomic gas fraction than is observed. Nevertheless, our fiducial model with feedback and self-gravity has shown to be robust in reproducing the statistical properties of the basic molecular gas components of the ISM in our Galaxy.",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"Instrumentation and methods for astrophysics focuses on detector and telescope design, experiment proposals.

Magnetoelastic Effects in Iron Telluride,Position-dependent exact-exchange energy for slabs and semi-infinite jellium,False,"Iron telluride doped lightly with selenium is known to undergo a first order magneto-structural transition before turning superconducting at higher doping. We study the effects of magneto-elastic couplings on this transition using symmetry considerations. We find that the magnetic order parameters are coupled to the uniform monoclinic strain of the unit cell with one iron per cell, as well as to the phonons at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. In the magnetic phase the former gives rise to monoclinic distortion while the latter induces dimerization of the ferromagnetic iron chains due to alternate lengthening and shortening of the nearest-neighbour iron-iron bonds. We compare this system with the iron arsenides and propose a microscopic magneto-elastic Hamiltonian which is relevant for all the iron based superconductors. We argue that this describes electron-lattice coupling in a system where electron-electron interaction is crucial.","The position-dependent exact-exchange energy per particle $\varepsilon_x(z)$ (defined as the interaction between a given electron at $z$ and its exact-exchange hole) at metal surfaces is investigated, by using either jellium slabs or the semi-infinite (SI) jellium model. For jellium slabs, we prove analytically and numerically that in the vacuum region far away from the surface $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{Slab}}(z \to \infty) \to - e^{2}/2z$, {\it independent} of the bulk electron density, which is exactly half the corresponding exact-exchange potential $V_{x}(z \to \infty) \to - e^2/z$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 97}, 026802 (2006)] of density-functional theory, as occurs in the case of finite systems. The fitting of $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{Slab}}(z)$ to a physically motivated image-like expression is feasible, but the resulting location of the image plane shows strong finite-size oscillations every time a slab discrete energy level becomes occupied. For a semi-infinite jellium, the asymptotic behavior of $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{SI}}(z)$ is somehow different. As in the case of jellium slabs $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{SI}}(z \to \infty)$ has an image-like behavior of the form $\propto - e^2/z$, but now with a density-dependent coefficient that in general differs from the slab universal coefficient 1/2. Our numerical estimates for this coefficient agree with two previous analytical estimates for the same. For an arbitrary finite thickness of a jellium slab, we find that the asymptotic limits of $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{Slab}}(z)$ and $\varepsilon_{x}^{\text{SI}}(z)$ only coincide in the low-density limit ($r_s \to \infty$), where the density-dependent coefficient of the semi-infinite jellium approaches the slab {\it universal} coefficient 1/2.",Superconductivity,"Superconductivity in condensed matter physics focuses on the study of materials and phenomena where electrical resistance drops to zero below a certain critical temperature, allowing for the flow of electric current without energy loss.

Dynamical properties of a particle in a wave packet: scaling invariance and boundary crisis,Intertwining operator for $AG_2$ Calogero-Moser-Sutherland system,False,"Some dynamical properties present in a problem concerning the acceleration of particles in a wave packet are studied. The dynamics of the model is described in terms of a two-dimensional area preserving map. We show that the phase space is mixed in the sense that there are regular and chaotic regions coexisting. We use a connection with the standard map in order to find the position of the first invariant spanning curve which borders the chaotic sea. We find that the position of the first invariant spanning curve increases as a power of the control parameter with the exponent 2/3. The standard deviation of the kinetic energy of an ensemble of initial conditions obeys a power law as a function of time, and saturates after some crossover. Scaling formalism is used in order to characterize the chaotic region close to the transition from integrability to nonintegrability and a relationship between the power law exponents is derived. The formalism can be applied in many different systems with mixed phase space. Then, dissipation is introduced into the model and therefore the property of area preservation is broken, and consequently attractors are observed. We show that after a small change of the dissipation, the chaotic attractor as well as its basin of attraction are destroyed, thus leading the system to experience a boundary crisis. The transient after the crisis follows a power law with exponent -2.",We consider generalised Calogero-Moser-Sutherland quantum Hamiltonian $H$ associated with a configuration of vectors $AG_2$ on the plane which is a union of $A_2$ and $G_2$ root systems. The Hamiltonian $H$ depends on one parameter. We find an intertwining operator between $H$ and the Calogero-Moser-Sutherland Hamiltonian for the root system $G_2$.

A scale space based algorithm for automated segmentation of single shot tagged MRI of shearing deformation,An Empirical Study of the Relation Between Community Structure and Transitivity,False,"Object This study proposes a scale space based algorithm for automated segmentation of single-shot tagged images of modest SNR. Furthermore the algorithm was designed for analysis of discontinuous or shearing types of motion, i.e. segmentation of broken tag patterns. Materials and methods The proposed algorithm utilizes non-linear scale space for automatic segmentation of single-shot tagged images. The algorithm's ability to automatically segment tagged shearing motion was evaluated in a numerical simulation and in vivo. A typical shearing deformation was simulated in a Shepp-Logan phantom allowing for quantitative evaluation of the algorithm's success rate as a function of both SNR and the amount of deformation. For a qualitative in vivo evaluation tagged images showing deformations in the calf muscles and eye movement in a healthy volunteer were acquired. Results Both the numerical simulation and the in vivo tagged data demonstrated the algorithm's ability for automated segmentation of single-shot tagged MR provided that SNR of the images is above 10 and the amount of deformation does not exceed the tag spacing. The latter constraint can be met by adjusting the tag delay or the tag spacing. Conclusion The scale space based algorithm for automatic segmentation of single-shot tagged MR enables the application of tagged MR to complex (shearing) deformation and the processing of datasets with relatively low SNR.","One of the most prominent properties in real-world networks is the presence of a community structure, i.e. dense and loosely interconnected groups of nodes called communities. In an attempt to better understand this concept, we study the relationship between the strength of the community structure and the network transitivity (or clustering coefficient). Although intuitively appealing, this analysis was not performed before. We adopt an approach based on random models to empirically study how one property varies depending on the other. It turns out the transitivity increases with the community structure strength, and is also affected by the distribution of the community sizes. Furthermore, increasing the transitivity also results in a stronger community structure. More surprisingly, if a very weak community structure causes almost zero transitivity, the opposite is not true and a network with a close to zero transitivity can still have a clearly defined community structure. Further analytical work is necessary to characterize the exact nature of the identified relationship.",Medical Physics,"Medical physics focuses on radiation therapy. Radiation dosimetry.

Fully achromatic nulling interferometer (FANI) for high SNR exoplanet characterization,Investigation of Dense Gas Towards Relativistic Outflow Sources,False,"Space-borne nulling interferometers have long been considered as the best option for searching and characterizing extra-solar planets located in the habitable zone of their parent stars. Solutions for achieving deep starlight extinction are now numerous and well demonstrated. However they essentially aim at realizing an achromatic central null in order to extinguish the star. In this communication is described a major improvement of the technique, where the achromatization process is extended to the entire fringe pattern. Therefore higher Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and appreciable simplification of the detection system should result.

Neural Networks Enforcing Physical Symmetries in Nonlinear Dynamical Lattices: The Case Example of the Ablowitz-Ladik Model,Elliptic-rogue waves and modulational instability in nonlinear soliton equations,False,"In this work we introduce symmetry-preserving, physics-informed neural networks (S-PINNs) motivated by symmetries that are ubiquitous to solutions of nonlinear dynamical lattices. Although the use of PINNs have recently attracted much attention in data-driven discovery of solutions chiefly to partial differential equations, we demonstrate that they fail at enforcing important physical laws including symmetries of solutions and conservation laws. Through the correlation of parity symmetries in both space and time of solutions to differential equations with their group equivariant representation, we construct group-equivariant NNs which respect spatio-temporal parity symmetry. Moreover, we adapt the proposed architecture to enforce different types of periodicity (or localization) of solutions to nonlinear dynamical lattices. We do so by applying S-PINNs to the completely integrable Ablowitz-Ladik model, and performing numerical experiments with a special focus on waveforms that are related to rogue structures. These include the Kuznetsov-Ma soliton, and Akhmediev breather as well as the Peregrine soliton. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed architecture over standard PINNs.","We present elliptic-rogue wave solutions for integrable nonlinear soliton equations in theta functions. Unlike solutions generated on the plane wave background, these solutions depict rogue waves emerging on elliptic function backgrounds. By refining the modified squared wave function method in tandem with the Darboux-B\""acklund transformation, we establish a quantitative correspondence between elliptic-rogue waves and the modulational instability. This connection reveals that the modulational instability of elliptic function solutions triggers rational-form solutions displaying elliptic-rogue waves, whereas the modulational stability of elliptic function solutions results in the rational-form solutions exhibiting the elliptic-solitons or elliptic-breathers. Moreover, this approach enables the derivation of higher-order elliptic-rogue waves, offering a versatile framework for constructing elliptic-rogue waves and exploring modulational stability in other integrable equations.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Phase synchronization between collective rhythms of globally coupled oscillator groups: noiseless non-identical case,Conservation Laws of Variable Coefficient Diffusion-Convection Equations,False,"Phase synchronization between collective oscillations exhibited by two weakly interacting groups of non-identical phase oscillators with internal and external global sinusoidal coupling of the groups is analyzed theoretically. Coupled amplitude equations describing the collective oscillations of the oscillator groups are obtained by using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, and then coupled phase equations for the collective oscillations are derived by phase reduction of the amplitude equations. The collective phase coupling function, which determines the dynamics of macroscopic phase differences between the groups, is calculated analytically. It is demonstrated that the groups can exhibit effective anti-phase collective synchronization even if the microscopic external coupling between individual oscillator pairs belonging to different groups is in-phase, and similarly effective in-phase collective synchronization in spite of microscopic anti-phase external coupling between the groups.","We study local conservation laws of variable coefficient diffusion-convection equations of the form $f(x)u_t=(g(x)A(u)u_x)_x+h(x)B(u)u_x$. The main tool of our investigation is the notion of equivalence of conservation laws with respect to the equivalence groups. That is why, for the class under consideration we first construct the usual equivalence group $G^{\sim}$ and the extended one $\hat G^{\sim}$ including transformations which are nonlocal with respect to arbitrary elements. The extended equivalence group $\hat G^{\sim}$ has interesting structure since it contains a non-trivial subgroup of gauge equivalence transformations.

Starting from a lattice formulation we derive the continuum limit of the action which turns out to be a generalisation of the heat kernel in the presence of a topological term. In the continuum limit we can reconstruct the topological information encoded in the theta term. In the topologically trivial cases the theta term gives only a trivial shift to the ground state energy but in the topologically nontrivial ones it remains to be coupled to the dynamics in the continuum. In particular for the U($N$) gauge group on orientable surfaces it gives rise to a phase transition at $\theta= \pi$, similar to the ones observed in other models.

Structure and properties of the vacuum of the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai model,Gauge-Invariant Formalism with a Dirac-mode Expansion for Confinement and Chiral Symmetry Breaking,False,"We investigate numerically the phase structure of the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) model in four dimensions. In the numerical simulations of the zero temperature TEK model (using a symmetric twist) we observe the existence of new phases that break its centre symmetry at intermediate lattice couplings and for large SU(N) gauge groups. This effect can be explained by the contribution of diagonal configurations with collapsed eigenvalues, which are particular cases of ``generalised fluxons''. We also investigate finite temperature versions of the TEK model using anisotropic lattice couplings, where in particular we find van Baal fluxons contributing at large anisotropies.","Using the eigen-mode of the QCD Dirac operator $\Slash D=\gamma^\mu D^\mu$, we develop a manifestly gauge-covariant expansion and projection of the QCD operators such as the Wilson loop and the Polyakov loop. With this method, we perform a direct analysis of the correlation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in lattice QCD Monte Carlo calculation on $6^4$ at $\beta$=5.6. Even after removing the low-lying Dirac modes, which are responsible to chiral symmetry breaking, we find that the Wilson loop obeys the area law, and the slope parameter corresponding to the string tension or the confinement force is almost unchanged. We find also that the Polyakov loop remains to be almost zero even without the low-lying Dirac modes, which indicates the $Z_3$-unbroken confinement phase.

Search for dijet resonances in events with an isolated charged lepton using $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector,Dark Matter from Strong Dynamics: The Minimal Theory of Dark Baryons,False,"A search for dijet resonances in events with at least one isolated charged lepton is performed using $139~{\text{fb}}^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The dijet invariant-mass ($m_{jj}$) distribution constructed from events with at least one isolated electron or muon is searched in the region $0.22 < m_{jj} < 6.3$ TeV for excesses above a smoothly falling background from Standard Model processes. Triggering based on the presence of a lepton in the event reduces limitations imposed by minimum transverse momentum thresholds for triggering on jets. This approach allows smaller dijet invariant masses to be probed than in inclusive dijet searches, targeting a variety of new-physics models, for example ones in which a new state is produced in association with a leptonically decaying $W$ or $Z$ boson. No statistically significant deviation from the Standard Model background hypothesis is found. Limits on contributions from generic Gaussian signals with widths ranging from that determined by the detector resolution up to 15% of the resonance mass are obtained for dijet invariant masses ranging from 0.25 TeV to 6 TeV. Limits are set also in the context of several scenarios beyond the Standard Model, such as the Sequential Standard Model, a technicolor model, a charged Higgs boson model and a simplified Dark Matter model.","As a simple model for dark matter, we propose a QCD-like theory based on $\rm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory with one flavor of dark quark. The model is confining at low energy and we use lattice simulations to investigate the properties of the lowest-lying hadrons. Compared to QCD, the theory has several peculiar differences: there are no Goldstone bosons or chiral symmetry restoration when the dark quark becomes massless; the usual global baryon number symmetry is enlarged to $\rm{SU}(2)_B$, resembling isospin; and baryons and mesons are unified together in $\rm{SU}(2)_B$ iso-multiplets. We argue that the lightest baryon, a vector boson, is a stable dark matter candidate and is a composite realization of the hidden vector dark matter scenario. The model naturally includes a lighter state, the analog of the $\eta^\prime$ in QCD, for dark matter to annihilate into to set the relic density via thermal freeze-out. Dark matter baryons may also be asymmetric, strongly self-interacting, or have their relic density set via $3 \to 2$ cannibalizing transitions. We discuss some experimental implications of coupling dark baryons to the Higgs portal.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Multidimensional integrable boundary problems,Wake-induced response of vibro-impacting systems,False,"A method of looking for boundary conditions consistent with the integrability property of multidimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) type equations is discussed. The method is based on involutions of the Lax pair taken at the border plane. New classes of boundary conditions for the KP and Hirota equations are proposed consistent with the Lax pair. The boundary problem on the stripe 0<y<1 for the KP equation is discussed, its exact solutions are found. Ward's problem on discrete versions of the generalized Toda chains is briefly discussed.","This study investigates the bifurcation behaviour of wake-induced vibro-impacting systems considering fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The primary structure and the near wake dynamics are modelled as a harmonic oscillator a Van der Pol oscillator, respectively, and are weakly coupled to each other. A non-deformable barrier obstructing the motion of the oscillator gives rise to the impacting dynamics. Instantaneous velocity reversal occurs when the structure impacts with this barrier. Qualitative changes in the dynamical behaviour of this system are investigated in the context of discontinuity-induced bifurcations (DIBs) resulting from the interaction of fluid flow and non-smoothness from the primary structure. Phenomenological behaviour like co-existence of attractors and period-adding cascades of limit cycles leading to chaos are examined. Existence of these phenomena are demonstrated via stability analysis using Floquet theory and associated Lyapunov spectra. A new approach to capture the impact dynamics of the hybrid system through a transverse discontinuity map is proposed. Orbits obtained using this new algorithm is demonstrated to accurately predict both stable and chaotic regimes as observed from the corresponding bifurcation diagrams. The effect of the presence of non-smoothness on the lock-in phenomenon in systems that involve fluid-structure interaction is studied for the first time",Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems,"Exactly solvable and integrable systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that can be solved exactly through analytical methods or have properties that allow for integrability.

Fast electromagnetic response of a thin film of resonant atoms with permanent dipole,Casualty Dynamics in Wars and Terrorism and the Scale-Free Organization of Social Systems,False,"We consider the propagation of extremely short pulses through a dielectric thin film containing resonant atoms (two level atoms) with permanent dipole. Assuming that the film width is less than the field wave length, we can solve the wave equation and reduce the problem to a system of generalized Bloch equations describing the resonant atoms. We compute the stationary solutions for a constant irradiation of the film. Superimposing a small amplitude linear wave we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients. From these, one can then deduce the different parameters of the model. We believe this technique could be used in experiments to obtain the medium atomic and relaxation parameters.","In this paper I propose a 'mechanism' for the explanation of power-law characteristics of casualty dynamics in inter-state wars, intra-state wars and terrorist attacks: the scale-free physical organization of social systems. Other explanations - self-organized criticality (Cederman, 2003) and the redistribution of total attack capabilities (Johnson et al. 2006) - do not provide a consistent framework for the power-law characteristics of casualty dynamics. The development in time of the power-law characteristics of casualty dynamics during wars and conflicts provides clues for the 'functioning' of social systems which are targeted, and/or for the (in)effectiveness and strategies of actors using force (violence) against these social systems.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Dynamics and Rheology of Ring-Linear Blend Semidilute Solutions in Extensional Flow: Modeling and Molecular Simulations,Low-Temperature Light Detectors: Neganov-Luke Amplification and Calibration,False,"We use Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations and single molecule experiments to investigate the influence of topological constraints and hydrodynamic interactions on the dynamics and rheology of solutions of ring-linear polymer blends at the overlap concentration. We find agreement between simulation and experiment in that rings in solution blends exhibit large conformational fluctuations, including extension overshoots in the startup of flow and tumbling and tank-treading at steady state. Ring polymer fluctuations increase with blend fraction of linear polymers and are peaked at a ring Weissenberg number $\textrm{Wi}_R \approx 1.5$. On the contrary, linear and ring polymers in pure solutions show a peak in fluctuations at the critical coil-stretch Weissenberg number $\textrm{Wi} = 0.5$. BD simulations show that extension overshoots on startup of flow are due to flow-induced intermolecular ring-linear polymer hooks, whereas fluctuations at steady state are dominated by intermolecular hydrodynamic interactions (HI). This is supported by simulations of bidisperse linear polymer solution blends, which show similar trends in conformational dynamics between rings and linear polymers with a matched contour length. Compared to BD simulations, single molecule experiments show quantitatively larger fluctuations, which could arise because experiments are performed on higher molecular weight polymers with stronger topological constraints. To this end, we have advanced the understanding of the effects of topological interactions and intermolecular HI on the dynamics of semidilute ring-linear polymer blend solutions.","The simultaneous measurement of phonons and scintillation light induced by incident particles in a scintillating crystal such as CaWO4 is a powerful technique for the active rejection of background induced by gamma's and beta's and even neutrons in direct Dark Matter searches. However, less than ~1% of the energy deposited in a CaWO4 crystal is detected as light. Thus, very sensitive light detectors are needed for an efficient event-by-event background discrimination. Due to the Neganov-Luke effect, the threshold of low-temperature light detectors based on semiconducting substrates can be improved significantly by drifting the photon-induced electron-hole pairs in an applied electric field. We present measurements with low-temperature light detectors based on this amplification mechanism.

Antihyperon potentials in nuclei via exclusive antiproton-nucleus reactions at FAIR,Is early thermalization achieved only near midrapidity at RHIC ?,False,"The exclusive production of hyperon-antihyperon pairs close to their production threshold in antiproton - nucleus collisions offers a unique and hitherto unexplored opportunity to elucidate the behaviour of antihyperons in nuclei. For the first time we analyse these reactions in a microscopic transport model using the the Gie\ss en Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model. The calculation take the delicate interplay between the strong absorption of antihyperons, their rescattering and refraction at the nuclear surface as well as the Fermi motion of the struck nucleon into account. We find a substantial sensitivity of transverse momentum correlations of coincident $\Lambda\overline{\Lambda}$-pairs to the assumed depth of the $\overline{\Lambda}$-potential. Because of the high cross section for this process and the simplicity of the experimental method our results are highly relevant for future activities at the international Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR).","The pseudorapidity dependence of elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at 130 $A$ GeV is studied within a full three-dimensional hydrodynamic model in the light-cone coordinate. First, we prepare two initial conditions in the hydrodynamic model for analyzing elliptic flow. Both initial conditions lead to reasonable agreement with single particle spectra in central and semi-central collisions. Next, by using these hydrodynamic simulations, we compare elliptic flow as a function of pseudorapidity with experimental data recently measured by the PHOBOS Collaboration. Our results are in agreement with experimental data only near midrapidity. This suggests that thermalization in the early stage of collisions is not achieved in forward and backward rapidity regions.",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

Strange nonchaos in self-excited singing flames,Boussinesq Solitary-Wave as a Multiple-Time Solution of the Korteweg-de Vries Hierarchy,False,"We report the first experimental evidence of strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA) in the natural dynamics of a self-excited laboratory-scale system. In the previous experimental studies, the birth of SNA was observed in quasiperiodically forced systems; however, such an evidence of SNA in an autonomous laboratory system is yet to be reported. We discover the presence of SNA in between the attractors of quasiperiodicity and chaos through a fractalization route in a laboratory thermoacoustic system. The observed dynamical transitions from order to chaos via SNA is confirmed through various nonlinear characterization methods prescribed for the detection of SNA.","We study the Boussinesq equation from the point of view of a multiple-time reductive perturbation method. As a consequence of the elimination of the secular producing terms through the use of the Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy, we show that the solitary--wave of the Boussinesq equation is a solitary--wave satisfying simultaneously all equations of the Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy, each one in an appropriate slow time variable.",Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems,"Adaptation and self-organizing systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that exhibit adaptive behavior and self-organization.

An interpretable machine learning framework for dark matter halo formation,"Molecular Cloud Evolution IV: Magnetic Fields, Ambipolar Diffusion, and the Star Formation Efficiency",False,"We present a generalization of our recently proposed machine learning framework, aiming to provide new physical insights into dark matter halo formation. We investigate the impact of the initial density and tidal shear fields on the formation of haloes over the mass range $11.4 \leq \log(M/M_{\odot}) \leq 13.4$. The algorithm is trained on an N-body simulation to infer the final mass of the halo to which each dark matter particle will later belong. We then quantify the difference in the predictive accuracy between machine learning models using a metric based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We first train the algorithm with information about the density contrast in the particles' local environment. The addition of tidal shear information does not yield an improved halo collapse model over one based on density information alone; the difference in their predictive performance is consistent with the statistical uncertainty of the density-only based model. This implies that our machine learning setup does not identify any significant role for the tidal shear in determining halo masses. This result is confirmed as we verify the ability of the initial conditions-to-halo mass mapping learnt from one simulation to generalize to independent simulations. Our work illustrates the broader potential of developing interpretable machine learning frameworks to gain physical understanding of non-linear large-scale structure formation.","We investigate the formation and evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) by the collision of convergent warm neutral medium (WNM) streams in the interstellar medium, in the presence of magnetic fields and ambipolar diffusion (AD), focusing on the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency (SFE), as well as of the mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio (M2FR) in the forming clouds. We find that: 1) Clouds formed by supercritical inflow streams proceed directly to collapse, while clouds formed by subcritical streams first contract and then re-expand, oscillating on the scale of tens of Myr. 2) Our suite of simulations with initial magnetic field strength of 2, 3, and 4 $\mu\G$ show that only supercritical or marginal critical streams lead to reasonable star forming rates. 3) The GMC's M2FR is a generally increasing function of time, whose growth rate depends on the details of how mass is added to the GMC from the WNM. 4) The M2FR is a highly fluctuating function of position in the clouds. 5) In our simulations, the SFE approaches stationarity, because mass is added to the GMC at a similar rate at which it converts mass to stars. In such an approximately stationary regime, the SFE provides a proxy of the supercritical mass fraction in the cloud. 6) We observe the occurrence of buoyancy of the low-M2FR regions within the gravitationally-contracting GMCs, so that the latter naturally segregate into a high-density, high-M2FR ""core"" and a low-density, low-M2FR ""envelope"", without the intervention of AD.

Production of various elements in ultraperipheral $^{208}$Pb-$^{208}$Pb collisions at the LHC,Chemical and mechanical spinodals a unique liquid-gas instability,False,"As predicted by theory and confirmed by measurements, one, two or three neutrons are emitted frequently in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of heavy relativistic nuclei, in particular, $^{208}$Pb. The exchange of low-energy Weizs\""{a}cker--Williams photons dominates in such interactions. This leads to the excitation and decay of Giant Dipole Resonances (GDR) in colliding nuclei below the proton emission threshold. Less is known about the electromagnetic dissociation of $^{208}$Pb induced by energetic photons leading to violent fragmentation of $^{208}$Pb. The UPCs of lead nuclei at the LHC were modelled with Relativistic ELectromagnetic Dissociation (RELDIS) model to evaluate the contribution of photonuclear reactions in the domain of quasideuteron absorption and at higher photon energies. It was demonstrated that due to the presence of a single heavy residue in the final state mostly accompanied by free protons and neutrons, the cross sections of the production of specific elements can be well approximated by the proton emission cross sections, which can be measured in the ALICE experiment at the LHC.",We demonstrate that the instabilities of asymmetric nuclear matter at sub-saturation densities do not present two types of instabilities as usually discussed but a unique one.

Width difference in the $B_s$-$\bar{B}_s$ system with lattice NRQCD,Addressing the LHC flavour anomalies with horizontal gauge symmetries,False,"We compute the matrix element of the four-quark operator $\Op_S$ = $\bar{b}(1-\gamma_5) s \bar{b} (1-\gamma_5) s$ in the $B_s-\bar{B}_s$ mixing on the lattice using NRQCD, which gives a leading contribution in the calculation of the width difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$ in the $1/m_b$ expansion. Using the next-to-leading formula of Beneke \textit{et al.}, we obtain $(\Delta\Gamma/\Gamma)_s$ = 0.151(37)(36)(17), where the the first error reflects the uncertainty of $f_{B_s}$ = 245(30) MeV, the second error comes from our calculation of the matrix element of $\Op_S$, and the third represents unknown $1/m_b$ correction.","We study the impact of an additional $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry with flavour-dependent charges for quarks and leptons on the LHC flavour anomalies observed in $B \to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$, $R(K) = B \to K \mu^+\mu^-/B \to K e^+e^-$, and $h \to \mu\tau$. In its minimal version with two scalar doublets, the resulting model naturally explains the deviations from the Standard Model observed in $B \to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$ and $R(K)$. The CMS access in $h \to \mu\tau$ can be explained by introducing a third scalar doublet, which gives rise to a prediction for $\tau \to 3\mu$.

Casimir interactions in Ising strips with boundary fields: exact results,Lattice Mechanics of Origami Tessellations,False,An exact statistical mechanical derivation is given of the critical Casimir forces for Ising strips with arbitrary surface fields applied to edges. Our results show that the strength as well as the sign of the force can be controled by varying the temperature or the fields. An interpretation of the results is given in terms of a linked cluster expansion. This suggests a systematic approach for deriving the critical Casimir force which can be used in more general models.,"Origami-based design holds promise for developing materials whose mechanical properties are tuned by crease patterns introduced to thin sheets. Although there has been heuristic developments in constructing patterns with desirable qualities, the bridge between origami and physics has yet to be fully developed. To truly consider origami structures as a class of materials, methods akin to solid mechanics need to be developed to understand their long-wavelength behavior. We introduce here a lattice theory for examining the mechanics of origami tessellations in terms of the topology of their crease pattern and the relationship between the folds at each vertex. This formulation provides a general method for associating mechanical properties with periodic folded structures, and allows for a concrete connection between more conventional materials and the mechanical metamaterials constructed using origami-based design.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Discrepancies in production rates were observed at the Tevatron, at LEP, and in fixed-target experiments. The newly advocated color-octet mechanism provides a plausible solution to the anomalous quarkonium production observed at the Tevatron. The color-octet mechanism should also affect other quarkonium production channels.

Role of environment on nuclear activity,Investigation of Rocket Effect in BRC 18 using Gaia EDR3,False,"Motivated by the apparently conflicting results reported in the literature on the effect of environment on nuclear activity, we have carried out a new analysis by comparing the fraction of galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the most overdense regions (rich galaxy clusters) and the most underdense ones (voids) in the local universe. Exploiting the classical BPT diagnostics, we have extracted volume limited samples of star forming and AGN galaxies. We find that, at variance with star-forming galaxies, AGN galaxies have similar distributions of specific star formation rates and of galactic ages (as indicated by the Dn4000 parameter) both in clusters and in voids. In both environments galaxies hosting AGNs are generally old, with low star formation activity. The AGN fraction increases faster with stellar mass in clusters than in voids, especially above 10^10.2 M(sun). Our results indicate that, in the local universe, the nuclear activity correlates with stellar mass and galaxy morphology and is weakly, if at all, affected by the local galaxy density.","Bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs) are ideal candidates to study radiation-driven implosion mode of star formation as they are potential sites of triggered star formation, located at the edges of H{\sc ii} regions, showing evidence of ongoing star formation processes. BRC 18 is located towards the eastern edge of relatively closer ($\sim$400 pc) H{\sc ii} region excited by $\lambda$ Ori. We made R-band polarimetric observations of 17 candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) located towards BRC 18 to investigate any preferred orientation of the discs with respect to the ambient magnetic field and the direction of energetic photons from $\lambda$ Ori. We found that the discs are oriented randomly with respect to the projected magnetic field. Using distances and proper motions from the \textit{Gaia} EDR3 of the candidate YSOs, we investigated the possible acceleration of BRC 18, away from $\lambda$ Ori due to the well known ""Rocket Effect"", by assuming that both the candidate YSOs and BRC 18 are kinematically coupled. The relative proper motions of the candidate YSOs are found to show a trend of moving away from $\lambda$ Ori. We computed the offset between the angle of the direction of the ionization front and the relative proper motion of the candidate YSOs and found it to lie close to being parallel to each other. Additionally, we found 12 sources that are comoving with the known candidate YSOs towards BRC 18.

Rev. Lett. 99, 250405 (2007)]. The generated spin states approach many-body singlet states, and contain a macroscopic number of entangled particles, even when individual spin is large. We introduce the Gaussian treatment of unpolarized spin states and use it to estimate the achievable spin squeezing for realistic experimental parameters.

Pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems in the presence of short-term memory,Symmetry broken states in an ensemble of globally coupled pendulums,False,"We study reaction-diffusion systems beyond the Markovian approximation to take into account the effect of memory on the formation of spatio-temporal patterns. Using a non-Markovian Brusselator model as a paradigmatic example, we show how to use reductive perturbation to investigate the formation and stability of patterns. Focusing in detail on the Hopf instability and short-term memory, we derive the corresponding complex Ginzburg-Landau equation that governs the amplitude of the critical mode and we establish the explicit dependence of its parameters on the memory properties. Numerical solution of this memory dependent complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as well as direct numerical simulation of the non-Markovian Brusselator model illustrate that memory changes the properties of the spatio-temporal patterns. Our results indicate that going beyond the Markovian approximation might be necessary to study the formation of spatio-temporal patterns even in systems with short-term memory. At the same time, our work opens up a new window into the control of these patterns using memory.","We consider the rotational dynamics in an ensemble of globally coupled identical pendulums. This model is essentially a generalization of the standard Kuramoto model, which takes into account the inertia and the intrinsic nonlinearity of the community elements. There exists the wide variety of in-phase and out-of-phase regimes. Many of these states appear due to broken symmetry. In the case of small dissipation our theoretical analysis allows one to find the boundaries of the instability domain of in-phase rotational mode for ensembles with arbitrary number of pendulums, describe all arising out-of-phase rotation modes and study in detail their stability. For the system of three elements parameter sets corresponding to the unstable in-phase rotations we find a number of out-of-phase regimes and investigate their stability and bifurcations both analytically and numerically.

Organization Mining Using Online Social Networks,Short range gravitational fields: Rise and fall of the fifth force,False,"Mature social networking services are one of the greatest assets of today's organizations. This valuable asset, however, can also be a threat to an organization's confidentiality. Members of social networking websites expose not only their personal information, but also details about the organizations for which they work. In this paper we analyze several commercial organizations by mining data which their employees have exposed on Facebook, LinkedIn, and other publicly available sources. Using a web crawler designed for this purpose, we extract a network of informal social relationships among employees of a given target organization. Our results, obtained using centrality analysis and Machine Learning techniques applied to the structure of the informal relationships network, show that it is possible to identify leadership roles within the organization solely by this means. It is also possible to gain valuable non-trivial insights on an organization's structure by clustering its social network and gathering publicly available information on the employees within each cluster.

Signatures of valence fluctuations in CeCu2Si2 under high pressure,Mixed Bubbles in a one-dimensional Bose-Bose mixture,False,"Simultaneous resistivity and a.c.-specific heat measurements have been performed under pressure on single crystalline CeCu2Si2 to over 6 GPa in a hydrostatic helium pressure medium. A series of anomalies were observed around the pressure coinciding with a maximum in the superconducting critical temperature, $T_c^{max}$. These anomalies can be linked with an abrupt change of the Ce valence, and suggest a second quantum critical point at a pressure $P_v \simeq 4.5$ GPa, where critical valence fluctuations provide the superconducting pairing mechanism, as opposed to spin fluctuations at ambient pressure. Such a valence instability, and associated superconductivity, is predicted by an extended Anderson lattice model with Coulomb repulsion between the conduction and f-electrons. We explain the T-linear resistivity found at $P_v$ in this picture, while other anomalies found around $P_v$ can be qualitatively understood using the same model.","We investigate a Bose-Bose mixture across the miscible-immiscible phase transition governed by quantum fluctuations in one dimension. We find the recently predicted so-called mixed bubbles as ground states close to the mean-field miscible-immiscible threshold. These bubbles form a pocket of miscibility, separated by one of the components. The collective excitations reflect the symmetry breaking resulting from the bubble formation. The partial miscibility of the system allows for persistent currents in an annular confinement. Intriguingly, the mixed bubble acts like an intrinsic weak link, connecting the rotational behavior of the mixed bubble state to current efforts in atomtronic applications.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

B^0-\bar{B}^0 mixing with quenched lattice NRQCD,"TeV Scale Leptogenesis, theta_13 And Doubly Charged Particles At LHC",False,"We present our recent results for the B-parameters, which parameterize the \Delta B=2 transition amplitudes.

The operators are perturbatively renormalized including corrections of O(\alpha_s/am_Q). We examine scaling behavior of the B-parameters in detail, and discuss the systematic uncertainties using scatter of results with different analysis procedures adopted. As a result, we find B_{B_d}(m_b)=0.84(2)(8), B_{B_s}/B_{B_d}=1.017(10)(^{+4}_{-0}) and B_{S_s}(m_b)=0.87(1)(9)(^{+1}_{-0}) in the quenched approximation.","We explore a realistic supersymmetric SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_B-L model spontaneously broken at around 10^12 GeV.

Intrinsic current drive by electromagnetic electron drift wave turbulence in tokamak pedestal region,"Geometry of River Networks I: Scaling, Fluctuations, and Deviations",False,"The local intrinsic parallel current density driven by electron drift wave (DW) turbulence including electromagnetic (EM) effects is analytically studied. The scalings of the ratios of intrinsic current density driven by residual turbulent flux and by turbulent source to the bootstrap current density with electron density and temperature are predicted to be $T_e^{3/4}T_i/n_e$ and $T_eT_i/n_e$, respectively. Based on the typical parameters in DIII-D pedestal region, the local intrinsic current density driven by both the residual turbulent flux and the turbulent source is negligible. However, despite the negligible turbulent source driven current, the residual turbulent flux driven local intrinsic current density by EM DW turbulence can reach about 66% of the bootstrap current density for ITER pedestal parameters due to much lower collisionality in ITER than in DIII-D. Moreover, the contributions from adiabatic ES parts, non-adiabatic ES parts and non-adiabatic EM parts of the plasma response to electromagnetic fluctuations are analyzed. It is found that there exists strong cancelation between non-adiabatic ES response and the non-adiabatic EM response for the ITER pedestal case, and thus the kinetic stress contributed by the adiabatic ES response of parallel electron pressure dominates the intrinsic current drive. This is different from the ES electron DW case. Therefore, the EM effects on turbulence driven intrinsic current density should be carefully considered in the future reactor with high ratio of electron pressure to the magnetic pressure and steep pressure profile.","This article is the first in a series of three papers investigating the detailed geometry of river networks. Large-scale river networks mark an important class of two-dimensional branching networks, being not only of intrinsic interest but also a pervasive natural phenomenon. In the description of river network structure, scaling laws are uniformly observed. Reported values of scaling exponents vary suggesting that no unique set of scaling exponents exists. To improve this current understanding of scaling in river networks and to provide a fuller description of branching network structure, we report here a theoretical and empirical study of fluctuations about and deviations from scaling. We examine data for continent-scale river networks such as the Mississippi and the Amazon and draw inspiration from a simple model of directed, random networks. We center our investigations on the scaling of the length of sub-basin's dominant stream with its area, a characterization of basin shape known as Hack's law. We generalize this relationship to a joint probability density and show that fluctuations about scaling are substantial. We find strong deviations from scaling at small scales which can be explained by the existence of linear network structure. At intermediate scales, we find slow drifts in exponent values indicating that scaling is only approximately obeyed and that universality remains indeterminate. At large scales, we observe a breakdown in scaling due to decreasing sample space and correlations with overall basin shape. The extent of approximate scaling is significantly restricted by these deviations and will not be improved by increases in network resolution.",Plasma Physics,"Plasma physics focuses on fundamental plasma physics.

Analysis of thermally stimulated luminescence and conductivity without quasiequilibrium approximation,Effect of gravitational field on collective motion of fish,False,"Thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) and conductivity (TSC) are considered using the classical insulator model that assumes one kind of the active trap, one kind of inactive deep trap, and one kind of the recombination center. Kinetic equations describing the model are solved numerically without and with the use of the quasiequilibrium (QE) approximation. The QE state parameter qI,, the relative recombination probability g, and a new parameter called quasi-stationary (QS) state parameter q*=qIg are used for the analysis of the TSL and TSC. The TSL and TSC curves and the temperature dependences of qI, q*, g, the recombination lifetime, and the occupancies of active traps and recombination centers are numerically calculated for five sets of kinetic parameters and different heating rates. These calculation results show that: (1) the upper limit of the heating rate for presence of the QS state appears at higher heating rate than that for the QE state when the retrapping process is present, and (2) the TSL (TSC) curves in the QS state have the properties similar to those for the TSL (TSC) curves in the QE state. Approximate formulas for calculation of the parameters qI and q* in the initial range of the TSL and TSC curves are derived and used in the heating-rate methods, proposed in this work, for determination of those parameters from the calculated TSL curves.","Fish exhibit various patterns of collective motion, in which individual fish sense the gravitational field and tend to move horizonally. We study the effect of gravity on the collective patterns by incorporating suppression of vertical motion in an agent-based model. The gravitational factor induces a tornado which is a vertically and highly elongated form of a torus, The vortex axis becomes almost identical to the vertical axis even when the gravitational factor is weak compared to the interaction between fish.

On the Dynamical Foundation of Multifractality,Complex dynamics in generalizations of the Chaplygin sleigh,False,"The crucial aspect of this demonstration is the discovery of renewal events, hidden in the computed dynamics of a multifractal metronome, which enables the replacement of the phenomenon of strong anticipation with a time delayed cross-correlation between the driven and the driving metronome. We establish that the phenomenon of complexity matching, which is the theme of an increasing number of research groups, has two distinct measures. One measure is the sensitivity of a complex system to environmental multi-fractality; another is the level of information transfer, between two complex networks at criticality. The cross-correlation function is evaluated in the ergodic long-time limit, but its delayed maximal value is the signature of information transfer occurring in the non ergodic short-time regime. It is shown that a more complex system transfers its multifractality to a less complex system while the reverse case is not possible.","The article considers Chaplygin sleigh on a plane in potential well, assuming that an external potential force is supplied at the mass center. Two particular cases are studied in some detail, namely, a one-dimensional potential valley and a potential with rotational symmetry; in both cases the models reduce to four-dimensional differential equations conserving mechanical energy. Assuming the potential functions quadratic, various behaviors are observed numerically depending of the energy, from those characteristic to conservative dynamics (regularity islands and chaotic sea) to strange attractors. This is another example of nonholonomic system manifesting these phenomena (similar to those for Celtic stone or Chaplygin top), which reflects a fundamental nature of these systems occupying intermediate position between conservative and dissipative dynamics.",Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems,"Adaptation and self-organizing systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that exhibit adaptive behavior and self-organization.

Integrated K-band spectra of old and intermediate-age globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud,Testing the No-Hair Theorem with Observations in the Electromagnetic Spectrum. IV. Relativistically Broadened Iron Lines,False,"Current stellar population models have arguably the largest uncertainties in the near-IR wavelength range, partly due to a lack of large and well calibrated empirical spectral libraries. In this paper we present a project, which aim it is to provide the first library of luminosity weighted integrated near-IR spectra of globular clusters to be used to test the current stellar population models and serve as calibrators for the future ones. Our pilot study presents spatially integrated K-band spectra of three old (>10 Gyr) and metal poor ([Fe/H]~-1.4), and three intermediate age (1-2 Gyr) and more metal rich ([Fe/H]~-0.4) globular clusters in the LMC. We measured the line strengths of the Na I, Ca I and 12CO(2-0) absorption features. The Na I index decreases with the increasing age and decreasing metallicity of the clusters. The Dco index, used to measure the 12CO(2-0) line strength, is significantly reduced by the presence of carbon-rich TP-AGB stars in the globular clusters with age ~1 Gyr. This is in contradiction with the predictions of the stellar population models of Maraston (2005). We find that this disagreement is due to the different CO absorption strength of carbon-rich Milky Way TP-AGB stars used in the models and the LMC carbon stars in our sample. For globular clusters with age >2 Gyr we find Dco index measurements consistent with the model predictions.","According to the no-hair theorem, astrophysical black holes are fully characterized by their masses and spins and are described by the Kerr metric. This theorem can be tested observationally by measuring (at least) three different multipole moments of the spacetimes of black holes. In this paper, we calculate the profiles of fluorescent iron lines emitted from the accretion flows around black hole candidates within a framework that allows us to perform the calculation as a function of its mass and spin as well as of a free parameter that measures potential deviations from the Kerr metric. We show that such deviations lead to line profiles that are significantly altered and may exhibit a modified flux ratio of the two peaks in their characteristic double-peaked shape. We also show that the disk inclination can be measured independently of the spin and the deviation parameter at low to intermediate inclination angles as in the case of Kerr black holes. We estimate the precision that near-future X-ray missions such as Astro-H and ATHENA+ are required to achieve in order to resolve deviations from the Kerr metric in iron line profiles and show that constraints on such deviations will be strongest for rapidly spinning black holes. More generally, we show that measuring the line profile with a precision of ~5% at disk inclinations of 30 or 60 degrees constraints the deviation parameter to order unity for values of the spin a>0.5M.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Successive cohorts of Twitter users show increasing activity and shrinking content horizons,Vibronic exciton theory of singlet fission. II. Two-dimensional spectroscopic detection of the correlated triplet pair state,False,"The global public sphere has changed dramatically over the past decades: a significant part of public discourse now takes place on algorithmically driven platforms owned by a handful of private companies. Despite its growing importance, there is scant large-scale academic research on the long-term evolution of user behaviour on these platforms, because the data are often proprietary to the platforms. Here, we evaluate the individual behaviour of 600,000 Twitter users between 2012 and 2019 and find empirical evidence for an acceleration of the way Twitter is used on an individual level. This manifests itself in the fact that cohorts of Twitter users behave differently depending on when they joined the platform. Behaviour within a cohort is relatively consistent over time and characterised by strong internal interactions, but over time behaviour from cohort to cohort shifts towards increased activity. Specifically, we measure this in terms of more tweets per user over time, denser interactions with others via retweets, and shorter content horizons, expressed as an individual's decaying autocorrelation of topics over time. Our observations are explained by a growing proportion of active users who not only tweet more actively but also elicit more retweets. These behaviours suggest a collective contribution to an increased flow of information through each cohort's news feed -- an increase that potentially depletes available collective attention over time. Our findings complement recent, empirical work on social acceleration, which has been largely agnostic about individual user activity.","Singlet fission, the molecular process through which photons are effectively converted into pairs of lower energy triplet excitons, holds promise as a means of boosting photovoltaic device efficiencies. In the preceding article of this series, we formulated a vibronic theory of singlet fission, inspired by previous experimental and theoretical studies suggesting that vibronic coupling plays an important role in fission dynamics. Here, we extend our model in order to simulate two-dimensional electronic spectra, through which the theory is further validated based on a comparison to recent measurements on pentacene crystals. Moreover, by means of such spectral simulations, we provide new insights into the nature of the correlated triplet pair state, the first product intermediate in the fission process.

Algebro-Geometric Solutions of the Camassa--Holm hierarchy,"Nonsmooth Bifurcations, Transient Hyperchaos and Hyperchaotic Beats in a Memristive Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua Circuit",False,"We provide a detailed treatment of the Camassa--Holm (CH) hierarchy with special emphasis on its algebro-geometric solutions. In analogy to other completely integrable hierarchies of soliton equations such as the KdV or AKNS hierarchies, the CH hierarchy is recursively constructed by means of basic polynomial formalism invoking a spectral parameter. Moreover, we study Dubrovin-type equations for auxiliary divisors and associated trace formulas, consider the corresponding algebro-geometric initial value problem, and derive the theta function representations of algebro-geometric solutions of the CH hierarchy.","In this paper, a memristive Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua (MLC) circuit is built by replacing the nonlinear element of an ordinary MLC circuit, namely the Chua's diode, with a three segment piecewise linear active flux controlled memristor. The bistability nature of the memristor introduces two discontinuty boundaries or switching manifolds in the circuit topology. As a result, the circuit becomes a piecewise smooth system of second order. Grazing bifurcations, which are essentially a form of discontinuity induced non-smooth bifurcations, occur at these boundaries and govern the dynamics of the circuit. While the interaction of the memristor aided self oscillations of the circuit and the external sinusoidal forcing result in the phenomenon of beats occurring in the circuit, grazing bifurcations endow them with chaotic and hyper chaotic nature. In addition the circuit admits a codimension-5 bifurcation and transient hyper chaos. Grazing bifurcations as well as other behaviors have been analyzed numerically using time series plots, phase portraits, bifurcation diagram, power spectra and Lyapunov spectrum, as well as the recent 0-1 K test for chaos, obtained after constructing a proper Zero Time Discontinuity Map (ZDM) and Poincare Discontinuity Map (PDM) analytically.

Earlier performed observations of a change in the Chern-Simons number are supplemented with a measurement of the lowest eigenvalues of the three-dimensional staggered fermion Dirac operator and observations of the spatial extension of energy lumps associated with the transition. The observations corroborate on the interpretation of the change in Chern-Simons numbers as representing continuum physics, not lattice artifacts. By combining the various observations it is possible to follow in considerable detail the time-history of thermal fluctuations of the classical gauge-field configurations responsible for the change in the Chern-Simons number.","We present combined searches for the Low Mass Standard Model Higgs boson at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=$1.96 TeV, using up to 5 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider.

Analysis of the ECH effect on the EPM/AEs stability in Heliotron J plasma using a Landau closure model,Access to mass rapid transit in OECD urban areas,False,"The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of the electron cyclotron heating (ECH) on the linear stability of Alfven Eigenmodes (AE) and energetic particle modes (EPM) triggered by energetic ions in Heliotron J plasma. The analysis is performed using the FAR3d code that solves a reduced MHD model to describe the thermal plasma coupled with a gyrofluid model for the energetic particles (EP) species. The simulations reproduce the AE/EPM stability trends observed in the experiments as the electron temperature (Te) increases, modifying the thermal plasma beta, EP beta and EP slowing down time. Particularly, the n/m=1/2 EPM and 2/4 Global AE (GAE) are stabilized in the low bumpiness (LB) configuration due to an enhancement of the continuum, Finite Larmor radius (FLR) and e-i Landau damping effects as the thermal beta increases. On the other hand, a larger ECH injection power cannot stabilize the AE/EPM in Medium (MB) and High bumpiness (HB) configurations because the damping effects are weaker compared to the LB case, unable to balance the further destabilization induced by an enhanced EP resonance as the EP slowing down time and EP beta increases with Te","As mitigating car traffic in cities has become paramount to abate climate change effects, fostering public transport in cities appears ever-more appealing.

Patterns in Flowing Sand: Understanding the Physics of Granular Flow,Giant Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Spin-Filter van der Waals Heterostructures,False,"Dense granular flows are often unstable and form inhomogeneous structures. Although significant advances have been recently made in understanding simple flows, instabilities of such flows are often not understood. We present experimental and numerical results that show the formation of longitudinal stripes that arise from instability of the uniform flowing state of granular media on a rough inclined plane. The form of the stripes depends critically on the mean density of the flow with a robust form of stripes at high density that consists of fast sliding plug-like regions (stripes) on top of highly agitated boiling material - a configuration reminiscent of the Leidenfrost effect when a droplet of liquid lifted by its vapor is hovering above a hot surface.","Magnetic multilayer devices that exploit magnetoresistance are the backbone of magnetic sensing and data storage technologies.

We demonstrate tunneling magnetoresistance which is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI3 layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for magnetic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. These devices also show multiple resistance states as a function of magnetic field, suggesting the potential for multi-bit functionalities using an individual vdW sf-MTJ. Using magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer antiferromagnetic ordering of the atomically thin CrI3.

Anisotropic q-Gaussian velocity distributions in LambdaCDM halos,Observing the Evolution of the Universe,False,"The velocity distribution function (VDF) of dark matter (DM) halos in $\Lambda$CDM dissipationless cosmological simulations, which must be non-separable in its radial and tangential components, is still poorly known. We present the first single-parameter, non-separable, anisotropic model for the VDF in $\Lambda$CDM halos, built from an isotropic $q$-Gaussian (Tsallis) VDF of the isotropic set of dimensionless spherical velocity components (after subtraction of streaming motions), normalized by the respective velocity dispersions. We test our VDF on 90 cluster-mass halos of a dissipationless cosmological simulation. Beyond the virial radius, $r_{\rm vir}$, our model VDF adequately reproduces that measured in the simulated halos, but no $q$-Gaussian model can adequately represent the VDF within $r_{\rm vir}$, as the speed distribution function is then flatter-topped than any $q$-Gaussian can allow. Nevertheless, our VDF fits significantly better the simulations than the commonly used Maxwellian (Gaussian) distribution, at virtually all radii within $5\,r_{\rm vir}$. Within 0.4 (1) $r_{\rm vir}$, the non-Gaussianity index $q$ is (roughly) linearly related to the slope of the density profile and also to the velocity anisotropy profile. We provide a parametrization of the modulation of $q$ with radius for both the median fits and the fit of the stacked halo. At radii of a few percent of $r_{\rm vir}$, corresponding to the Solar position in the Milky Way, our best-fit VDF, although fitting better the simulations than the Gaussian one, overproduces significantly the fraction of high velocity objects, indicating that one should not blindly use these $q$-Gaussian fits to make predictions on the direct detection rate of DM particles.","How did the universe evolve?

In the aftermath, many residents of Puerto Rico were without power or clean running water for nearly a year. Using both English and Spanish tweets from September 16 to October 15 2017, we investigate discussion of Mar\'ia both on and off the island, constructing a proxy for the temporal network of communication between victims of the hurricane and others. We use information theoretic tools to compare the lexical divergence of different subgroups within the network. Lastly, we quantify temporal changes in user prominence throughout the event.

At the local level, we find that information propagating among Puerto Ricans most often originated from sources local to the island, such as journalists and politicians. Critically, content from these accounts overshadows content from celebrities, global news networks, and the like for the large majority of the time period studied. Our findings reveal insight into ways social media campaigns could be deployed to disseminate relief information during similar events in the future.","Effective Field Theory (EFT) is the successful paradigm underlying modern theoretical physics, including the ""Core Theory"" of the Standard Model of particle physics plus Einstein's general relativity. I will argue that EFT grants us a unique insight: each EFT model comes with a built-in specification of its domain of applicability. Hence, once a model is tested within some domain (of energies and interaction strengths), we can be confident that it will continue to be accurate within that domain. Currently, the Core Theory has been tested in regimes that include all of the energy scales relevant to the physics of everyday life (biology, chemistry, technology, etc.). Therefore, we have reason to be confident that the laws of physics underlying the phenomena of everyday life are completely known.",Physics and Society,"Physics and society focuses on structure, dynamics and collective behavior of societies and groups (human or otherwise).

Predictive data-driven model based on generative adversarial network for premixed turbulence-combustion regimes,Relativistic magnetic reconnection driven by a laser interacting with a micro-scale plasma slab,False,"Premixed flames exhibit different asymptotic regimes of interaction between heat release and turbulence depending on their respective length scales. At high Karlovitz number, the dilatation caused by heat release does not have any relevant effect on turbulent kinetic energy with respect to non-reacting flow, while at low Karlovitz number, the mean shear is a sink of turbulent kinetic energy, and counter-gradient transport is observed. This latter phenomenon is not well captured by closure models commonly used in Large Eddy Simulations that are based on gradient diffusion. The massive amount of data available from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) opens the possibility to develop data-driven models able to represent physical mechanisms and non-linear features present in both these regimes. In this work, the databases are formed by DNSs of two planar hydrogen/air flames at different Karlovitz numbers corresponding to the two asymptotic regimes. In this context, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) gives the possibility to successfully recognize and reconstruct both gradient and counter-gradient phenomena if trained with databases where both regimes are included. Two GAN models were first trained each for a specific Karlovitz number and tested using the same dataset in order to verify the capability of the models to learn the features of a single asymptotic regime and assess its accuracy. In both cases, the GAN models were able to reconstruct the Reynolds stress subfilter scales accurately. Later, the GAN was trained with a mixture of both datasets to create a model containing physical knowledge of both combustion regimes. This model was able to reconstruct the subfilter scales for both cases capturing the interaction between heat release and turbulence closely to the DNS as shown from the turbulent kinetic budget and barycentric maps.","Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process associated with conversion of the embedded magnetic field energy into kinetic and thermal plasma energy, via bulk acceleration and Ohmic dissipation. In many high-energy astrophysical events, magnetic reconnection is invoked to explain the non-thermal signatures. However, the processes by which field energy is transferred to the plasma to power the observed emission are still not properly understood. Here, via 3D particle-in-cell simulations of a readily available (TW-mJ-class) laser interacting with a micro-scale plasma slab, we show that when the electron beams excited on both sides of the slab approach the end of the plasma structure, ultrafast relativistic magnetic reconnection occurs in a magnetically-dominated (low-$\beta$) plasma. The resulting efficient particle acceleration leads to the emission of relativistic electron jets with cut-off energy $\sim$ 12 MeV. The proposed scenario can significantly improve understanding of fundamental questions such as reconnection rate, field dissipation and particle acceleration in relativistic magnetic reconnection.",Fluid Dynamics,"Fluid dynamics in physics focuses on turbulence, instabilities, incompressible/compressible flows, reacting flows.

Integrable discretizations of some cases of the rigid body dynamics,A Mathematical Model with Modified Logistic Approach for Singly-Peaked Population Processes,False,"A heavy top with a fixed point and a rigid body in an ideal fluid are important examples of Hamiltonian systems on a dual to the semidirect product Lie algebra $e(n)=so(n)\ltimes\mathbb R^n$. We give a Lagrangian derivation of the corresponding equations of motion, and introduce discrete time analogs of two integrable cases of these systems: the Lagrange top and the Clebsch case, respectively. The construction of discretizations is based on the discrete time Lagrangian mechanics on Lie groups, accompanied by the discrete time Lagrangian reduction. The resulting explicit maps on $e^*(n)$ are Poisson with respect to the Lie--Poisson bracket, and are also completely integrable. Lax representations of these maps are also found.","When a small number of individuals of organism of single species is confined in a closed space with limited amount of indispensable resources, their breading may start initially under suitable conditions, and after peaking, the population should go extinct as the resources are exhausted. Starting with the logistic equation and assuming that the carrying capacity of the environment is a function of the amount of resources, a mathematical model describing such pattern of population change is obtained. An application of this model to typical population records, that of deer herds by Scheffer (1951) and O'Roke and Hamerstrome (1948), yields estimations of the initial amount of indispensable food and its availability or nutritional efficiency which were previously unspecified.",Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems,"Exactly solvable and integrable systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that can be solved exactly through analytical methods or have properties that allow for integrability.

Parameter estimation in nonlinear stochastic differential equations,"Jordan form, parabolicity and other features of change of type transition for hydrodynamic type systems",False,"We discuss the problem of parameter estimation in nonlinear stochastic differential equations based on sampled time series. A central message from the theory of integrating stochastic differential equations is that there exists in general two time scales, i.e. that of integrating these equations and that of sampling. We argue that therefore maximum likelihood estimation is computational extremely expensive. We discuss the relation between maximum likelihood and quasi maximum likelihood estimation. In a simulation study, we compare the quasi maximum likelihood method with an approach for parameter estimation in nonlinear stochastic differential equations that disregards the existence of the two time scales.","Changes of type transitions for the two-component hydrodynamic type systems are discussed.

Tellurium Hydrides at High Pressures: High-temperature Superconductors,Do Spherical Polyelectrolyte Brushes Interdigitate?,False,"Observation of high-temperature superconductivity in sulfur hydrides at megabar pressures has generated an irresistible wave on searching for new superconductors in other compressed hydrogen-rich compounds. An immediate effort is towards exploration of the relevant candidate of tellurium hydrides, where tellurium is isoelectronic to sulfur but it has a heavier atomic mass and much weaker electronegativity. The hitherto unknown phase diagram of tellurium hydrides at high pressures was investigated by a first-principles swarm structure search. Four energetically stable and metallic stoichiometries of H4Te, H5Te2, HTe and HTe3 were uncovered above 140 GPa, showing a distinct potential energy map of tellurium hydrides from those in sulfur and selenium hydrides. The two hydrogen-rich H4Te and H5Te2 species adopt ionic structures containing exotic quasi-molecular H2 and linear H3 units, respectively. Strong electron-phonon couplings associated with the intermediate-frequency H-derived wagging and bending modes make them good superconductors with high Tc in the range of 46-104 K.","The structure of spherical micelles of the diblock copolymer poly(styrene-block-acrylic acid) in water was investigated with small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and contrast matching.

Atomically Thin Boron Nitride: Unique Properties and Applications,Out-of-plane nesting driven spin spiral in ultrathin Fe/Cu(001) films,False,"Atomically thin boron nitride (BN) is an important two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial, with many properties distinct from graphene. In this feature article, these unique properties and associated applications often not possible from graphene are outlined. The article starts with characterization and identification of atomically thin BN.

We show that the SS originates in nested regions confined to out-of-plane FSs, which are drastically modified compared to in-plane FSs. From precise reciprocal space maps in successive zones, we obtain the associated real space compressive strain of 1.5+-0.5% along c-axis.

Self-interacting dark matter with a stable vector mediator,Evidence for large-scale excesses associated with low HI column densities in the sky $$\\$$I. Dust excess,False,"Light vector mediators can naturally induce velocity-dependent dark matter self-interactions while at the same time allowing for the correct dark matter relic abundance via thermal freeze-out. If these mediators subsequently decay into Standard Model states such as electrons or photons however, this is robustly excluded by constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We study to what extent this conclusion can be circumvented if the vector mediator is stable and hence contributes to the dark matter density while annihilating into lighter degrees of freedom. We find viable parts of parameter space which lead to the desired self-interaction cross section of dark matter to address the small-scale problems of the collisionless cold dark matter paradigm while being compatible with bounds from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis observations.","Where dust and gas are uniformly mixed, atomic hydrogen can be traced through the detection of far-infrared (FIR) or UV emission of dust. We considered, for the origin of discrepancies observed between various direct and indirect tracers of gas outside the Galactic plane, possible corrections to the zero levels of the Planck-HFI detectors. We set the zero levels of the Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) skymaps as well as the 100 $\mu$m map from COBE/DIRBE and IRAS from the correlation between FIR emission and atomic hydrogen column density excluding regions of lowest gas column density. A modified blackbody model fit to those new zero-subtracted maps led to significantly different maps of the opacity spectral index $\beta$ and temperature $T$ and an overall increase in the optical depth at 353 GHz $\tau_{353}$ of 7.1$\times$10$^{-7}$ compared to the data release 2 Planck map. When comparing $\tau_{353}$ and the HI column density, we observed a uniform spatial distribution of the opacity outside regions with dark neutral gas and CO except in various large-scale regions of low NHI that represent 25% of the sky. In those regions, we observed an average dust column density 45% higher than predictions based on NHI with a maximum of 250% toward the Lockman Hole region. From the average opacity $\sigma_{e 353}$=(8.9$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{-27}$ cm$^2$ we deduced a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.53$\times$10$^{-2}$.

A New Probabilistic Wave Breaking Model for Dominant Wind-sea Waves Based on the Gaussian Field Theory,Measuring the Effectiveness of Learning Resources Via Student Interaction with Online Learning Modules,False,"This paper presents a novel method for obtaining the probability wave of breaking ($P_b$) of deep water, dominant wind-sea waves (that is, waves made of the energy within $\pm$30\% of the peak wave frequency) derived from Gaussian wave field theory. For a given input wave spectrum we demonstrate how it is possible to derive a joint probability density function between wave phase speed ($c$) and horizontal orbital velocity at wave crest ($u$) from which a model for $P_b$ can be obtained. A non-linear kinematic wave breaking criterion consistent with the Gaussian framework is further proposed. Our model would allow, therefore, for application of the classical wave breaking criterion (that is, wave breaking occurs if $u/c > 1$) in spectral wave models which, to the authors' knowledge, has not been done to date. Our results show that the proposed theoretical model has errors in the same order of magnitude as six other historical models when assessed using three field datasets. With optimization of the proposed model's single free parameter, it can become the best performing model for specific datasets. Although our results are promising, additional, more complete wave breaking datasets collected in the field are needed to comprehensively assess the present model, especially in regards to the dependence on phenomena such as direct wind forcing, long wave modulation and wave directionality.","We present a new method for measuring the effectiveness of online learning resources, through the analysis of time-stamped log data of students' interaction with a sequence of online learning modules created based on the concept of mastery learning. Each module was designed to assess students' mastery of one topic before and after interacting with the learning resources in the module. In addition, analysis of log data provides information on students' test-taking effort when completing the assessment, and learning effort when interacting with the learning resources. Combining these three measurements provides accurate information on the quality of each online learning module, as well as detailed suggestions for future improvements. The results from data collected from all 10 modules are presented in a sequence of sunburst charts, an intuitive visual representation designed to allow the average instructor to quickly grasp the key outcomes of the data analysis, and identify less effective modules for future improvements. Online learning modules can be implemented much more frequently than either clinical experiments or classroom assessments, and can provide more interpretable data than most existing online courses, making it a valuable tool for quickly assessing the effectiveness of online learning resources.",Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics,"Atmospheric and oceanic physics focuses on the physical processes occurring in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

Small-$x$ Asymptotics of the Gluon Helicity Distribution,S-shell $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei based on chiral interactions,False,"We determine the small-$x$ asymptotics of the gluon helicity distribution in a proton at leading order in perturbative QCD at large $N_c$. To achieve this, we begin by evaluating the dipole gluon helicity TMD at small $x$. In the process we obtain an interesting new result: in contrast to the unpolarized dipole gluon TMD case, the operator governing the small-$x$ behavior of the dipole gluon helicity TMD is different from the operator corresponding to the polarized dipole scattering amplitude (used in our previous work to determine the small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark helicity distribution). We then construct and solve novel small-$x$ large-$N_c$ evolution equations for the operator related to the dipole gluon helicity TMD. Our main result is the small-$x$ asymptotics for the gluon helicity distribution: $\Delta G \sim \left( \tfrac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h^G}$ with $\alpha_h^G = \tfrac{13}{4 \sqrt{3}} \, \sqrt{\tfrac{\alpha_s \, N_c}{2 \pi}} \approx 1.88 \, \sqrt{\tfrac{\alpha_s \, N_c}{2 \pi}}$. We note that the power $\alpha_h^G$ is approximately 20$\%$ lower than the corresponding power $\alpha_h^q$ for the small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark helicity distribution defined by $\Delta q \sim \left( \tfrac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h^q}$ with $\alpha_h^q = \tfrac{4}{\sqrt{3}} \, \sqrt{\tfrac{\alpha_s \, N_c}{2 \pi}} \approx 2.31 \, \sqrt{\tfrac{\alpha_s \, N_c}{2 \pi}}$ found in our earlier work.","We generalize the Jacobi no-core shell model (J-NCSM) to study double-strangeness hypernuclei. All particle conversions in the strangeness $S=-1,-2$ sectors are explicitly taken into account. In two-body space, such transitions may lead to the coupling between states of identical particles and of non-identical ones. Therefore, a careful consideration is required when determining the combinatorial factors that connect the many-body potential matrix elements and the free-space two-body potentials. Using second quantization, we systematically derive the combinatorial factors in question for $S=0,-1,-2$ sectors. As a first application, we use the J-NCSM to investigate $\Lambda \Lambda$ s-shell hypernuclei based on hyperon-hyperon (YY) potentials derived within chiral effective field theory at leading order (LO) and up to next-to-leading order (NLO). We find that the LO potential overbinds $^{\text{ }\text{ }\text{ } \text{}6}_{\Lambda \Lambda}\text{He}$ while the prediction of the NLO interaction is close to experiment.

Localization of trivial edge states in InAs/GaSb composite quantum wells,Anisotropy parameters of superconducting MgB$_2$,False,"InAs/GaSb heterostructure is one of the systems where quantum spin Hall effect is predicted to arise. However, as confirmed by recent experimental studies, the most significant highlight of the effect i.e., the conductance quantization due to non-trivial edge states is obscured by spurious conductivity arising from trivial edge states. In this work, we present experimental observation of strong localization of trivial edge modes in an InAs/GaSb heterostructure which was weakly disordered by silicon delta-like dopants within the InAs layer. The edge conduction which is characterized by a temperature-independent behavior at low temperatures and a power law at high temperatures is observed to be exponentially scaled with the length of the edge. Comprehensive analysis on measurements with a range of devices is in agreement with the localization theories in quasi one-dimensional electronic systems.","Data on macroscopic superconducting anisotropy of MgB$_2$ are reviewed.

Curing Braess' Paradox by Secondary Control in Power Grids,On the Spatial Asymptotics of Solutions of the Toda Lattice,False,"Robust operation of power transmission grids is essential for most of today's technical infrastructure and our daily life. Adding renewable generation to power grids requires grid extensions and sophisticated control actions on different time scales to cope with short-term fluctuations and long-term power imbalance. Braess' paradox constitutes a counterintuitive collective phenomenon that occurs if adding new transmission line capacity to a network increases loads on other lines, effectively reducing the system's performance and potentially even entirely removing its operating state. Combining simple analytical considerations with numerical investigations on a small sample network, we here study dynamical consequences of secondary control in AC power grid models. We demonstrate that sufficiently strong control not only implies dynamical stability of the system but may also cure Braess' paradox. Our results highlight the importance of demand control in conjunction with grid topology for stable operation and reveal a new functional benefit of secondary control.","We investigate the spatial asymptotics of decaying solutions of the Toda hierarchy and show that the asymptotic behaviour is preserved by the time evolution.

Probing neutrino decay scenarios by using the Earth matter effects on supernova neutrinos,Nebular Attenuation in H\alpha-selected Star-forming Galaxies at z=0.8 from the NewH\alpha\ Survey,False,"The observation of Earth matter effects in the spectrum of neutrinos coming from a next galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) could, in principle, reveal if neutrino mass ordering is normal or inverted. One of the possible ways to identify the mass ordering is through the observation of the modulations that appear in the spectrum when neutrinos travel through the Earth before they arrive at the detector. These features in the neutrino spectrum depend on two factors, the average neutrino energies, and the difference between the primary neutrino fluxes of electron and other flavors produced inside the supernova. However, recent studies indicate that the Earth matter effect for CCSN neutrinos is expected to be rather small and difficult to be observed by currently operating or planned neutrino detectors mainly because of the similarity of average energies and fluxes between electron and other flavors of neutrinos, unless the distance to CCSN is significantly smaller than the typically expected one, $\sim 10$ kpc. Here, we are looking towards the possibility if the non-standard neutrino properties such as decay of neutrinos can enhance the Earth matter effect. In this work we show that invisible neutrino decay can potentially enhance significantly the Earth matter effect for both $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ channels at the same time for both mass orderings, even if the neutrino spectra between electron and other flavors of neutrinos are very similar, which is a different feature not expected for CCSN neutrinos with standard oscillation without the decay effect.","We present measurements of the dust attenuation of H\alpha-selected emission-line galaxies at z=0.8 from the NewH\alpha\ narrowband survey. The analysis is based on deep follow-up spectroscopy with Magellan/IMACS, which captures the strong rest-frame optical emission lines from [OII] \lambda 3727 to [OIII] \lambda 5007. The spectroscopic sample used in this analysis consists of 341 confirmed H\alpha\ emitters. We place constraints on the AGN fraction using diagnostics which can be applied at intermediate redshift. We find that at least 5% of the objects in our spectroscopic sample can be classified as AGN and 2% are composite, i.e. powered by a combination of star-formation and AGN activity. We measure the dust attenuation for individual objects from the ratios of the higher order Balmer lines. The H\beta\ and H\gamma\ pair of lines is detected with S/N>5 in 55 individual objects and the H\beta\ and H\delta\ pair is detected in 50 individual objects. We also create stacked spectra to probe the attenuation in objects without individual detections. The median attenuation at H\alpha\ based on the objects with individually detected lines is A(H\alpha)=0.9+-1.0 magnitudes, in good agreement with the attenuation found in local samples of star-forming galaxies. We find that the z=0.8 galaxies occupy a similar locus of attenuation as a function of magnitude, mass and SFR as a comparison sample drawn from the SDSS DR4.

An improved technique for measuring plasma density to high frequencies on the Parker Solar Probe,A Forecasting System of Computational Time of DFT/TDDFT Calculations under the Multiverse ansatz via Machine Learning and Cheminformatics,False,"The correlation between the plasma density measured in space and the surface potential of an electrically conducting satellite body with biased electric field detectors has been recognized and used to provide density proxies. However, for Parker Solar Probe, this correlation has not produced quantitative density estimates over extended periods of time because it depends on the energy dependent exponential variation of the photoemission spectrum, the electron temperature, the ratio of the biased surface area to the conducting spacecraft surface area, the spacecraft secondary or thermal emission, the spacecraft distance from the Sun, etc. In this paper the density as a function of time and frequency to frequencies as high as the electron gyrofrequency is determined through least squares fits of a function of the spacecraft potential to the plasma density measured on the Parker Solar Probe. This function allows correction for the many effects on the spacecraft potential other than that due to the plasma density. Some examples of plasma density obtained from this procedure are presented.","A top-level designed forecasting system for predicting computational times of density-functional theory (DFT)/time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) calculations is presented. The computational time is assumed as the intrinsic property for the molecule.

Machine learning for online sea ice bias correction within global ice-ocean simulations,Method comparison for simulating non-Gaussian Beams and Diffraction for Precision Interferometry,False,"In this study we perform online sea ice bias correction within a GFDL global ice-ocean model. For this, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) which was developed in a previous study (Gregory et al., 2023) for the purpose of predicting sea ice concentration (SIC) data assimilation (DA) increments. An initial implementation of the CNN shows systematic improvements in SIC biases relative to the free-running model, however large summertime errors remain. We show that these residual errors can be significantly improved with a data augmentation approach, in which sequential CNN and DA corrections are applied to a new simulation over the training period. This then provides a new training data set with which to refine the weights of the initial network. We propose that this machine-learned correction scheme could be utilized for generating improved initial conditions, and also for real-time sea ice bias correction within seasonal-to-subseasonal sea ice forecasts.","In the context of simulating precision laser interferometers, we compare via several examples two wavefront decomposition methods: the Mode Expansion Method (MEM) and the Gaussian beam decomposition (GBD) for their precision and applicability. To judge the performance of these methods, we define different types of errors and study their properties. We specify how the two methods can be fairly compared and based on that, the quality of the MEM and GBD are compared in several examples. We test here cases for which analytic results are available, i.e., non-clipped circular and general astigmatic Gaussian beams, as well as clipped circular Gaussian beams, in the near-, far-, and extreme far-field of millions of kilometers occurring in space-gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, we compare the methods for aberrated wavefronts and the interaction with optical components by testing reflections from differently curved mirrors. We find that both methods can be generally used for decomposing non-Gaussian beams. However, which method is more accurate depends on the optical system and simulation settings. In the given examples, the MEM more accurately describes non-clipped Gaussian beams, while for clipped Gaussian beams and the interaction with surfaces, the GBD is more precise.",Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics,"Atmospheric and oceanic physics focuses on the physical processes occurring in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

Eigenrays in 3D heterogeneous anisotropic media: Part IV -- Geometric spreading from traveltime Hessian,Fabrication of porous microrings via laser printing and ion-beam post-etching,False,"Considering 3D heterogeneous anisotropic media, in Part III of this study we obtain the finite-element solution for the stationary ray path between two fixed endpoints using the finite element approach. It involves computation of the global (all-node) traveltime gradient vector and Hessian matrix, with respect to the nodal location and direction components. The global traveltime Hessian of the resolved stationary ray also plays an important role for obtaining the dynamic characteristics along the ray. It is a band matrix that includes the spatial, directional and mixed second derivatives of the traveltime at all nodes and nodal pairs. In Parts V, VI and VII of this study we explicitly use the global traveltime Hessian for solving the dynamic ray tracing equation, to obtain the geometric spreading at each point along the ray. Moreover, the dynamic ray tracing makes it possible to identify/classify caustics along the ray. In this part (Part IV) we propose an original two-stage approach for computing the relative geometric spreading of the entire ray path without explicitly performing the dynamic ray tracing. The first stage consists of an efficient algorithm for reducing the already computed global traveltime Hessian into a endpoint spatial traveltime Hessian. The second stage involves application of a known workflow for computing the geometrical spreading using the endpoint traveltime Hessian. Note that the method proposed in this part (Part IV) does not deliver information about caustics, nor the geometric spreading at intermediate points of the stationary ray path. Throughout the examples presented in Part VII we demonstrate the accuracy of the method proposed in this part over a set of isotropic and anisotropic examples by comparing the geometric spreading computed from this method based on the traveltime Hessian reduction with the one computed from the dynamic ray tracing.","Pulsed-laser dry printing of noble-metal microrings with a tunable internal porous structure, which can be revealed via an ion-beam etching post-procedure, was demonstrated. Abundance and average size of the pores inside the microrings were shown to be tuned in a wide range by varying incident pulse energy and a nitrogen doping level controlled in the process of magnetron deposition of the gold film in the appropriate gaseous environment. The fabricated porous microrings were shown to provide many-fold near-field enhancement of incident electromagnetic fields, which was confirmed by mapping of the characteristic Raman band of a nanometer-thick covering layer of Rhodamine 6G dye molecules and supporting finite-difference time-domain calculations. The proposed laser printing/ion-beam etching approach is demonstrated to be a unique tool aimed at designing and fabricating multifunctional plasmonic structures and metasurfaces for spectroscopic bioidentification based on surface-enhanced infrared absorption, Raman scattering and photoluminescence detection schemes.",Geophysics,Geophysics focuses on atmospheric physics.

Effects of the environment on the multiplicity properties of stars in the STARFORGE simulations,Gravitational Wave Statistics for Pulsar Timing Arrays: Examining Bias from Using a Finite Number of Pulsars,False,"Most observed stars are part of a multiple star system, but the formation of such systems and the role of environment and various physical processes is still poorly understood. We present a suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star-forming molecular clouds from the STARFORGE project that include stellar feedback with varied initial surface density, magnetic fields, level of turbulence, metallicity, interstellar radiation field, simulation geometry and turbulent driving. In our fiducial cloud the raw simulation data reproduces the observed multiplicity fractions for Solar-type and higher mass stars, similar to previous works. However, after correcting for observational incompleteness the simulation under-predicts these values. The discrepancy is likely due to the lack of disk fragmentation, as the simulation only resolves multiples that form either through capture or core fragmentation. The raw mass distribution of companions is consistent with randomly drawing from the initial mass function for the companions of $>1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stars, however, accounting for observational incompleteness produces a flatter distribution similar to observations. We show that stellar multiplicity changes as the cloud evolves and anti-correlates with stellar density. This relationship also explains most multiplicity variations between runs, i.e., variations in the initial conditions that increase stellar density (increased surface density, reduced turbulence) decrease multiplicity. While other parameters, such as metallicity, interstellar radiation, and geometry significantly affect the star formation history or the IMF, varying them produces no clear trend in stellar multiplicity properties.","Recently, many different pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported strong evidence for a common stochastic process in their data sets. The reported amplitudes are in tension with previously computed upper limits. In this paper, we investigate how using a subset of a set of pulsars biases Bayesian upper limit recovery. We generate 500 simulated PTA data sets based on the NANOGrav 11-year data set with an injected stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We then compute upper limits by sampling individual pulsar likelihoods, and combine them through a factorized version of the PTA likelihood to obtain upper limits on the GWB amplitude using different numbers of pulsars. We find that it is possible to recover an upper limit (95\% credible interval) \textit{below} the injected value, and that it is significantly more likely for this to occur when using a subset of pulsars to compute the upper limit. When picking pulsars to induce the maximum possible bias, we find that the 95\% Bayesian upper limit recovered is below the injected value in 10.6\% (53 of 500) of realizations. Further, we find that if we choose a subset of pulsars in order to obtain a lower upper limit than when using the full set of pulsars, the distribution of upper limits obtained from these 500 realizations is shifted to lower amplitude values.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Doubly coupled matter fields in massive bigravity,SN 2020uem: A Possible Thermonuclear Explosion within A Dense Circumstellar Medium (I) The Nature of Type IIn/Ia-CSM SNe from Photometry and Spectroscopy,False,"In the context of massive (bi-)gravity non-minimal matter couplings have been proposed. These couplings are special in the sense that they are free of the Boulware-Deser ghost below the strong coupling scale and can be used consistently as an effective field theory. Furthermore, they enrich the phenomenology of massive gravity. We consider these couplings in the framework of bimetric gravity and study the cosmological implications for background and linear tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations. Previous works have investigated special branch of solutions. Here we perform a complete perturbation analysis for the general background equations of motion completing previous analysis.","We have performed intensive follow-up observations of a Type IIn/Ia-CSM SN (SN IIn/Ia-CSM), 2020uem, with photometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry. In this paper, we report on the results of our observations focusing on optical/near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy. The maximum V-band magnitude of SN 2020uem is over $-19.5$ mag. The light curves decline slowly with a rate of $\sim 0.75 {\rm ~mag}/100 {\rm ~days}$. In the late phase ($\gtrsim 300$ days), the light curves show accelerated decay ($\sim 1.2 {\rm ~mag}/100 {\rm ~days}$). The optical spectra show prominent hydrogen emission lines and broad features possibly associated with Fe-peak elements. In addition, the $\rm H\alpha$ profile exhibits a narrow P-Cygni profile with the absorption minimum of $\sim 100 {\rm ~km~s^{-1}}$. SN 2020uem shows a higher $\rm H\alpha/H\beta$ ratio ($\sim 7$) than those of SNe IIn, which suggests a denser CSM. The NIR spectrum shows the Paschen and Brackett series with continuum excess in the H and Ks bands. We conclude that the NIR excess emission originates from newly-formed carbon dust. The dust mass ($M_{\rm d}$) and temperature ($T_{\rm d}$) are derived to be $(M_{\rm d}, T_{\rm d}) \sim (4-7 \times 10^{-5} {\rm ~M_{\odot}}, 1500-1600 {\rm ~K})$. We discuss the differences and similarities between the observational properties of SNe IIn/Ia-CSM and those of other SNe Ia and interacting SNe. In particular, spectral features around $\sim 4650$ {\text \AA} and $\sim 5900$ {\text \AA} of SNe IIn/Ia-CSM are more suppressed than those of SNe Ia; these lines are possibly contributed, at least partly, by \ion{Mg}{1}] and \ion{Na}{1}, and may be suppressed by high ionization behind the reverse shock caused by the massive CSM.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Faddeev calculation of 3 alpha and alpha alpha Lambda systems using alpha alpha resonating-group method kernel,"Systematic Extraction of Spectroscopic Factors from 12C(d,p)13C and 13C(p,d)12C Reactions",False,"We carry out Faddeev calculations of three-alpha (3 alpha) and two-alpha plus Lambda (alpha alpha Lambda) systems, using two-cluster resonating-group method kernels. The input includes an effective two-nucleon force for the alpha alpha resonating-group method and a new effective Lambda N force for the Lambda alpha interaction. The latter force is a simple two-range Gaussian potential for each spin-singlet and triplet state, generated from the phase-shift behavior of the quark-model hyperon-nucleon interaction, fss2, by using an inversion method based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Owing to the exact treatment of the Pauli-forbidden states between the clusters, the present three-cluster Faddeev formalism can describe the mutually related, alpha alpha, 3 alpha and alpha alpha Lambda systems, in terms of a unique set of the baryon-baryon interactions. For the three-range Minnesota force which describes the alpha alpha phase shifts quite accurately, the ground-state and excitation energies of 9Be Lambda are reproduced within 100 - 200 keV accuracy.","Existing measurements of the angular distributions of the ground-state to ground-state transitions of the 12C(d,p)13C and 13C(p,d)12C neutron-transfer reactions have been analyzed systematically using the Johnson-Soper adiabatic and distorted-wave theories. When using a consistent set of physical inputs the deduced spectroscopic factors are consistent to within 20% for incident deuteron energies from 6 to 60 MeV.

The dynamics of a shear band,A critical point for bifurcation cascades and featureless turbulence,False,"A shear band of finite length, formed inside a ductile material at a certain stage of a con- tinued homogeneous strain, provides a dynamic perturbation to an incident wave field, which strongly influences the dynamics of the material and affects its path to failure. The investigation of this perturbation is presented for a ductile metal, with reference to the incremental mechanics of a material obeying the J 2-deformation theory of plasticity (a special form of prestressed, elastic, anisotropic, and incompressible solid). The treatment originates from the derivation of integral representations relating the incremental mechan- ical fields at every point of the medium to the incremental displacement jump across the shear band faces, generated by an impinging wave. The boundary integral equations (under the plane strain assumption) are numerically approached through a collocation technique, which keeps into account the singularity at the shear band tips and permits the analysis of an incident wave impinging a shear band. It is shown that the presence of the shear band induces a resonance, visible in the incremental displacement field and in the stress intensity factor at the shear band tips, which promotes shear band growth. Moreover, the waves scattered by the shear band are shown to generate a fine texture of vibrations, par- allel to the shear band line and propagating at a long distance from it, but leaving a sort of conical shadow zone, which emanates from the tips of the shear band.","In this Letter we show that a bifurcation cascade and fully sustained turbulence can share the phase space of a fluid flow system, resulting in the presence of competing stable attractors. We analyse the toroidal pipe flow, which undergoes subcritical transition to turbulence at low pipe curvatures and supercritical transition at high curvatures, as was previously documented. We provide decisive evidence that the nature of the supercritical transition is of Ruelle--Takens type and that, in a narrow range of intermediate curvatures, its dynamics competes with that of sustained turbulence emerging through subcritical transition mechanisms.",Computational Physics,Computational physics focuses on all aspects of computational science applied to physics.
Lattice formulation of chiral gauge theories,Annihilation Rates of $^3D_2(2^{--})$ and $^3D_3(3^{--})$ Heavy Quarkonia,False,"We present a general formulation of chiral gauge theories, which admits Dirac operators with more general spectra, reveals considerably more possibilities for the structure of the chiral projections, and nevertheless allows appropriate realizations. In our analyses we use two forms of the correlation functions which both also apply in the presence of zero modes and for any value of the index. To account properly for the conditions on the bases the concept of equivalence classes of pairs of them is introduced. The behaviors under gauge transformations and under CP transformations are unambiguously derived.","We calculate the annihilation decay rates of the $^3D_2(2^{--})$ and $^3D_3(3^{--})$ charmonia and bottomonia by using the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter method. The wave functions of states with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{--}$ and $3^{--}$ are constructed. By solving the corresponding instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equations, we obtain the mass spectra and wave functions of the quarkonia. The annihilation amplitude is written within Mandelstam formalism and the relativistic corrections are taken into account properly. This is important, especially for high excited states, since their relativistic corrections are large. The results for the $3g$ channel are as follows: $\Gamma_{^3D_2(c\bar c)\rightarrow ggg} = 9.24$ keV, $\Gamma_{^3D_3(c\bar c)\rightarrow ggg}=25.0$ keV, $\Gamma_{^3D_2(b\bar b)\rightarrow ggg}= 1.87$ keV, and $\Gamma_{^3D_3(b\bar b)\rightarrow ggg}= 0.815$ keV.",High Energy Physics - Lattice,"High energy physics - lattice focuses on lattice field theory as a method to investigate the properties of quantum fields and strongly interacting systems, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons.

Two-dimensional solitons at interfaces between binary superlattices and homogeneous lattices,Strange nonchaos in self-excited singing flames,False,"We report on the experimental observation of two-dimensional surface solitons residing at the interface between a homogeneous square lattice and a superlattice that consists of alternating ""deep"" and ""shallow"" waveguides. By exciting single waveguides in the first row of the superlattice, we show that solitons centered on deep sites require much lower powers than their respective counterparts centered on shallow sites. Despite the fact that the average refractive index of the superlattice waveguides is equal to the refractive index of the homogeneous lattice, the interface results in clearly asymmetric output patterns.","We report the first experimental evidence of strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA) in the natural dynamics of a self-excited laboratory-scale system. In the previous experimental studies, the birth of SNA was observed in quasiperiodically forced systems; however, such an evidence of SNA in an autonomous laboratory system is yet to be reported. We discover the presence of SNA in between the attractors of quasiperiodicity and chaos through a fractalization route in a laboratory thermoacoustic system.

Dipolar quantization and the infinite circumference limit of two-dimensional conformal field theories,Non-perturbative renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory,False,"Elaborating on our previous presentation, where the term {\it dipolar quantization} was introduced, we argue here that adopting $L_0-(L_1+L_{-1})/2+{\bar L}_0-({\bar L}_1+{\bar L}_{-1})/2$ as the Hamiltonian instead of $L_0+{\bar L}_0$ yields an infinite circumference limit in two-dimensional conformal field theory. The new Hamiltonian leads to dipolar quantization instead of radial quantization. As a result, the new theory exhibits a continuous and strongly degenerated spectrum in addition to the Virasoro algebra with a continuous index. Its Hilbert space exhibits a different inner product than that obtained in the original theory. The idiosyncrasy of this particular Hamiltonian is its relation to the so-called sine-square deformation, which is found in the study of a certain class of quantum statistical systems. The appearance of the infinite circumference explains why the vacuum states of sine-square deformed systems are coincident with those of the respective closed-boundary systems.",We present a strategy for a non-perturbative determination of the finite renormalization constants of the energy-momentum tensor in the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory.

Remarks on the waterbag model of dispersionless Toda Hierarchy,A nonlinear graph-based theory for dynamical network observability,False,"We construct the free energy associated with the waterbag model of dToda. Also, the relations of conserved densities are investigated","A faithful description of the state of a complex dynamical network would require, in principle, the measurement of all its $d$ variables, an infeasible task for systems with practical limited access and composed of many nodes with high dimensional dynamics. However, even if the network dynamics is observable from a reduced set of measured variables, how to reliably identifying such a minimum set of variables providing full observability remains an unsolved problem. From the Jacobian matrix of the governing equations of nonlinear systems, we construct a {\it pruned fluence graph} in which the nodes are the state variables and the links represent {\it only the linear} dynamical interdependences encoded in the Jacobian matrix after ignoring nonlinear relationships. From this graph, we identify the largest connected sub-graphs where there is a path from every node to every other node and there are not outcoming links. In each one of those sub-graphs, at least one node must be measured to correctly monitor the state of the system in a $d$-dimensional reconstructed space. Our procedure is here validated by investigating large-dimensional reaction networks for which the determinant of the observability matrix can be rigorously computed.",Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems,"Exactly solvable and integrable systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that can be solved exactly through analytical methods or have properties that allow for integrability.

Electromagnetic fields in ultra-peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions,Nodal Lines in the Cranked HFB Overlap kernels,False,"Ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions (UPC) provide unique opportunities to study processes under strong electromagnetic fields. Highly-charged moving ions carry strong electromagnetic fields that act as fields of photons. The exchange of photons could induce photonuclear and two-photon interactions as well as excite the ions into giant dipole resonances (GDRs) or even higher excitation. The GDRs typically decay by emitting photons and even a single neutron, while high-excited resonances usually decay by emitting two or more photons and/or neutrons. On the other hand, the electromagnetic fields of heavy ions are very strong, so one of the two colliding ions is enforced by the other's electromagnetic field. As a result, the two colliding ions are pushed into opposite directions by the electromagnetic forces, and thus the neutrons emitted from different ions could present a back-to-back correlation. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation implementing the electromagnetic fields as well as the neutron emission from previous measurements or model calculations, we qualitatively demonstrate that the above electromagnetic effect is large enough to be observed in UPC, which would provide a clear means to study the strong electromagnetic fields and its effects.","Norm overlap kernels of the cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states are studied in the context of angular momentum projection.

Corrections to the ${\bf SU(3)\times SU(3)}$ Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation and chiral couplings $L^r_8$ and $H^r_2$,Inverse seesaw and dark matter in a gauged ${\rm B-L}$ extension with flavour symmetry,False,"Next to leading order corrections to the $SU(3) \times SU(3)$ Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation (GMOR) are obtained using weighted QCD Finite Energy Sum Rules (FESR) involving the pseudoscalar current correlator. Two types of integration kernels in the FESR are used to suppress the contribution of the kaon radial excitations to the hadronic spectral function, one with local and the other with global constraints. The result for the pseudoscalar current correlator at zero momentum is $\psi_5(0) = (2.8 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-3} GeV^{4}$, leading to the chiral corrections to GMOR: $\delta_K = (55 \pm 5)%$. The resulting uncertainties are mostly due to variations in the upper limit of integration in the FESR, within the stability regions, and to a much lesser extent due to the uncertainties in the strong coupling and the strange quark mass. Higher order quark mass corrections, vacuum condensates, and the hadronic resonance sector play a negligible role in this determination. These results confirm an independent determination from chiral perturbation theory giving also very large corrections, i.e. roughly an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding corrections in chiral $SU(2) \times SU(2)$. Combining these results with our previous determination of the corrections to GMOR in chiral $SU(2) \times SU(2)$, $\delta_\pi$, we are able to determine two low energy constants of chiral perturbation theory, i.e. $L^r_8 = (1.0 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-3}$, and $H^r_2 = - (4.7 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-3}$, both at the scale of the $\rho$-meson mass.","We propose a model which generates neutrino masses by the inverse seesaw mechanism, provides a viable dark matter candidate and explains the muon ($g-2$) anomaly. The Standard Model (SM) gauge group is extended with a gauged U(1)$_{\rm B-L}$ as well as a gauged U(1)$_{\rm L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$. While U(1)$_{\rm L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$ is anomaly free, the anomaly introduced by U(1)$_{\rm B-L}$ is cancelled between the six SM singlet fermions introduced for the inverse seesaw mechanism and four additional chiral fermions introduced in this model. After spontaneous symmetry breaking the four chiral fermionic degrees of freedom combine to give two Dirac states. The lightest Dirac fermion becomes stable and hence the dark matter candidate. We focus on the region of the parameter space where the dark matter annihilates to the right-handed neutrinos, relating the dark matter sector with the neutrino sector. The U(1)$_{\rm L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$ gauge symmetry provides a flavour structure to the inverse seesaw framework, successfully explaining the observed neutrino masses and mixings. We study the model parameters in the light of neutrino oscillation data and find correlation between them. Values of some of the model parameters are shown to be mutually exclusive between normal and inverted ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates. Moreover, the muon ($g-2$) anomaly can be explained by the additional contribution arising from U(1)$_{\rm L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}}$ gauge boson.",High Energy Physics - Lattice,"High energy physics - lattice focuses on lattice field theory as a method to investigate the properties of quantum fields and strongly interacting systems, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons.

The Ferromagnetic Potts model under an external magnetic field: an exact renormalization group approach,Boosting Transparency in Topological Josephson Junctions via Stencil Lithography,False,"The q-state ferromagnetic Potts model under a non-zero magnetic field coupled with the 0^th Potts state was investigated by an exact real-space renormalization group approach. The model was defined on a family of diamond hierarchical lattices of several fractal dimensions d_F. On these lattices, the renormalization group transformations became exact for such a model when a correlation coupling that singles out the 0^th Potts state was included in the Hamiltonian. The rich criticality presented by the model with q=3 and d_F=2 was fully analyzed. Apart from the Potts criticality for the zero field, an Ising-like phase transition was found whenever the system was submitted to a strong reverse magnetic field. Unusual characteristics such as cusps and dimensional reduction were observed on the critical surface.","Hybrid devices comprised of topological insulator (TI) nanostructures in proximity to s-wave superconductors (SC) are expected to pave the way towards topological quantum computation. Fabrication under ultra-high vacuum conditions is necessary to attain high quality of TI-SC hybrid devices, because the physical surfaces of V-VI three-dimensional TIs suffer from degradation at ambient conditions. Here, we present an in-situ process, which allows to fabricate such hybrids by combining molecular beam epitaxy and stencil lithography.

Wave interactions and the analysis of the perturbed Burgers equation,Synchronization Dynamics in the Presence of Coupling Delays and Phase Shifts,False,"In multiple-front solutions of the Burgers equation, all the fronts, except for two, are generated through the inelastic interaction of exponential wave solutions of the Lax pair associated with the equation. The inelastically generated fronts are the source of two difficulties encountered in the standard Normal Form expansion of the approximate solution of the perturbed Burgers equation, when the zero-order term is a multiple-front solution: (i) The higher-order terms in the expansion are not bounded; (ii) The Normal Form (equation obeyed by the zero-order approximation) is not asymptotically integrable; its solutions lose the simple wave structure of the solutions of the un-perturbed equation. The freedom inherent in the Normal Form method allows a simple modification of the expansion procedure, making it possible to overcome both problems in more than one way. The loss of asymptotic integrability is shifted from the Normal Form to the higher-order terms (part of which has to be computed numerically) in the expansion of the solution. The front-velocity update is different from the one obtained in the standard analysis.","In systems of coupled oscillators, the effects of complex signaling can be captured by time delays and phase shifts. Here, we show how time delays and phase shifts lead to different oscillator dynamics and how synchronization rates can be regulated by substituting time delays by phase shifts at constant collective frequency.

Kinetic ionization and recombination coefficients in the dense semiclassical plasmas on the basis of the effective interaction potential,Anisotropy of the acoustooptic figure of merit for LiNbO3 crystals. Isotropic diffraction,False,"In this paper, the ionization and recombination coefficients of dense semiclassical hydrogen plasma on the basis of the effective interaction potential have been investigated. For this goal the Bohr$-$Lindhard method and method phase function have been applied to obtain the electron capture and ionization cross sections. The electron capture cross section has been calculated in the framework of the perturbation theory. The effective interaction potential, which takes into account the screening effects at large distances and quantum diffraction effects at short distances, was used. The results of the investigation show the behaviour of the calculated kinetic coefficients with a change in the plasma parameters: the ionization coefficient decreases with increasing density and (or) coupling parameter while the recombination coefficient increases.","We have developed the approach for analyzing of anisotropy of acoustooptic figure of merit (AOFM) for lithium niobate crystals in the case of isotropic acoustooptic (AO) diffraction.

It is peculiar for the geometry of AO interaction of the shear acoustic wave propagating in the YZ plane (the velocity 3994 m/s) with the optical wave polarized in the same plane.

Precise prediction for the Higgs-Boson Masses in the $\mu\nu$SSM,Thermalization of mini-jets in a quark-gluon plasma,False,"The $\mu\nu$SSM is a simple supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (SM) capable of predicting neutrino physics in agreement with experiment. In this paper we perform the complete one-loop renormalization of the neutral scalar sector of the $\mu\nu$SSM with one generation of right-handed neutrinos in a mixed on-shell/$\overline{\mathrm{DR}}$ scheme. The renormalization procedure is discussed in detail, emphasizing conceptual differences to the minimal (MSSM) and next-to-minimal (NMSSM) supersymmetric standard model regarding the field renormalization and the treatment of non-flavor-diagonal soft mass parameters, which have their origin in the breaking of $R$-parity in the $\mu\nu$SSM. We calculate the full one-loop corrections to the neutral scalar masses of the $\mu\nu$SSM. The one-loop contributions are supplemented by available MSSM higher-order corrections. We obtain numerical results for a SM-like Higgs boson mass consistent with experimental bounds. We compare our results to predictions in the NMSSM to obtain a measure for the significance of genuine $\mu\nu$SSM-like contributions. We only find minor corrections due to the smallness of the neutrino Yukawa couplings, indicating that the Higgs boson mass calculations in the $\mu\nu$SSM are at the same level of accuracy as in the NMSSM. Finally we show that the $\mu\nu$SSM can accomodate a Higgs boson that could explain an excess of $\gamma\gamma$ events at $\sim 96\, \mathrm{GeV}$ as reported by CMS, as well as the $2\,\sigma$ excess of $b \bar{b}$ events observed at LEP at a similar mass scale.","We present the complete physical picture for the evolution of a high-energy jet propagating through a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by analytical and numerical investigation of thermalization of the soft components of the jet. Our results support the following physical picture: the leading particle emits a significant number of mini-jets which promptly evolve via multiple branching and thus degrade into a myriad of soft gluons, with energies of the order of the medium temperature $T$. Via elastic collisions with the medium constituents, these soft gluons relax to local thermal equilibrium with the plasma over a time scale which is considerably shorter than the typical lifetime of the mini-jet.

This instability is caused by a negative contribution of turbulence to the effective (mean-field) magnetic pressure and has previously been discussed in connection with the formation of active regions and perhaps sunspots. We want to understand the effects of rotation on this instability in both two and three dimensions. We use mean-field magnetohydrodynamics in a parameter regime in which the properties of the negative effective magnetic pressure instability have previously been found to be in agreement with those of direct numerical simulations. We find that the instability is suppressed already for relatively slow rotation with Coriolis numbers (i.e. inverse Rossby numbers) around 0.2. The suppression is strongest at the equator. In the nonlinear regime, we find traveling wave solutions with propagation in the prograde direction at the equator with additional poleward migration away from the equator. The prograde rotation of the magnetic pattern near the equator is argued to be a possible explanation for the faster rotation speed of magnetic tracers found on the Sun. In the bulk of the domain, kinetic and current helicities are negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the southern.","Photoevaporation and magnetically driven winds are two independent mechanisms to remove mass from protoplanetary disks. In addition to accretion, the effect of these two principles acting concurrently could be significant and the transition between those two has not been extensively studied and quantified in the literature yet. In order to contribute to the understanding of disk winds, we present the phenomena emerging in the framework of two-dimensional axisymmetric, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations including EUV-/ X-ray driven photoevaporation. Of particular interest are the examination of the transition region between photoevaporation and magnetically driven wind, the possibility of emerging magneto-centrifugal wind effects, as well as the morphology of the wind itself depending on the strength of the magnetic field. We use the PLUTO code in a 2.5D axisymmetric configuration with additional treatment of EUV-/ X-ray heating and dynamic ohmic diffusion based on a semi-analytical chemical model. We identify the transition between both outflow types to occur for values of the initial plasma beta $\beta \geq 10^7$, while magnetically driven winds generally outperform photoevaporation for stronger fields. In our simulations we observe irregular and asymmetric outflows for stronger magnetic fields. In the weak field regime the photoevaporation rates are slightly lowered by perturbations of the gas density in the inner regions of the disk. Overall, our results predict a wind with a lever arm smaller than 1.5, consistent with a hot magneto-thermal wind. Stronger accretion flows are present for values of $\beta < 10^7$.",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"Solar and stellar astrophysics focuses on white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variables.

"On a class of algebraic solutions to Painlev\'e VI equation, its determinant formula and coalescence cascade",Delay Regulated Explosive Synchronization in Multiplex Networks,False,A determinant formula for a class of algebraic solutions to Painlev\'e VI equation (P$_{\rm VI}$) is presented. This expression is regarded as a special case of the universal characters. The entries of the determinant are given by the Jacobi polynomials. Degeneration to the rational solutions of P$_{\rm V}$ and P$_{\rm III}$ is discussed by applying the coalescence procedure. Relationship between Umemura polynomials associated with P$_{\rm VI}$ and our formula is also discussed.,"It is known that explosive synchronization (ES) in an isolated network of Kuramoto oscillators with inertia is significantly enhanced by the presence of time delay. Here we show that time delay in one layer of the multiplex network governs the transition to synchronization and ES in the other layers. We found that a single layer with time-delayed intra-layer coupling, depending on the values of time delay, experiences a different type of transition to synchronization, e.g., ES or continuous, and the same type of transition is incorporated simultaneously in other layer(s) as well. Hence, a suitable choice of time-delay in only one layer can lead to a desired (either ES or continuous) transition simultaneously in the delayed and other undelayed layers of multiplexed network. These results offer a platform for a better understanding of the dynamics of those complex systems which are represented by multilayered framework and contain time delays in the communication processes.",Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems,"Exactly solvable and integrable systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that can be solved exactly through analytical methods or have properties that allow for integrability.

"3D two-point ray tracing for heterogeneous, weakly transversely-isotropic media",A model for codon position bias in RNA editing,False,"A two-point ray-tracing technique for 3D smoothly heterogeneous, weakly transversely-isotropic media is based on Fermat's principle and takes advantage of global Chebyshev approximation of both the model and curved rays. This approximation gives explicit derivatives of traveltimes with respect to ray parameters and allows one to use the rapidly converging conjugate gradient method to compute traveltimes. The method is fast because, for smoothly heterogeneous media, approximation of rays by only a few polynomials and a few conjugate gradient iterations provide excellent precision of traveltime calculation.","RNA editing can be crucial for the expression of genetic information via inserting, deleting, or substituting a few nucleotides at specific positions in an RNA sequence. Within coding regions in an RNA sequence, editing usually occurs with a certain bias in choosing the positions of the editing sites. In the mitochondrial genes of {\it Physarum polycephalum}, many more editing events have been observed at the third codon position than at the first and second, while in some plant mitochondria the second codon position dominates. Here we propose an evolutionary model that explains this bias as the basis of selection at the protein level. The model predicts a distribution of the three positions rather close to the experimental observation in {\it Physarum}. This suggests that the codon position bias in {\it Physarum} is mainly a consequence of selection at the protein level.",Geophysics,Geophysics focuses on atmospheric physics. Biogeosciences.

Surface in statistical ensembles,Stepwise Bose-Einstein condensation in a spinor gas,False,"The present contribution deals with surface terms appearing immediately in distributions and partition functions of statistical ensembles. It is shown that all ensembles under study, including ordinary canonical and grand canonical ensembles, involve surface terms. For a canonical ensemble both surface and volume terms correspond to a closed system. For a grand canonical ensemble the volume term corresponds to an open system, while the surface one - to a closed one. Finally, for the recently introduced open statistical ensemble the specific feature of which is the consideration of some surrounding region both volume and surface terms correspond to an open system. In conclusion, surface particles at solid/fluid boundary are interpreted as particles corresponding to number density oscillations near the surface; this completely agrees with the earlier introduced concept of surface tension at such a boundary.","We observe multi-step condensation of sodium atoms with spin $F=1$, where the different Zeeman components $m_F=0,\pm 1$ condense sequentially as the temperature decreases. The precise sequence changes drastically depending on the magnetization $m_z$ and on the quadratic Zeeman energy $q$ (QZE) in an applied magnetic field. For large QZE, the overall structure of the phase diagram is the same as for an ideal spin 1 gas, although the precise locations of the phase boundaries are significantly shifted by interactions. For small QZE, antiferromagnetic interactions qualitatively change the phase diagram with respect to the ideal case, leading for instance to condensation in $m_F=\pm 1$, a phenomenon that cannot occur for an ideal gas with $q>0$.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Heavy Quarks Photoproduction,Spacelike pion form factor from analytic continuation and the onset of perturbative QCD,False,"The state of the art of the theoretical calculations for heavy quarks photoproduction is reviewed. The full next-to-leading order calculation and two possible resummations, the high energy one for total cross sections and the large $p_T$ one for differential cross sections, are described.","The factorization theorem for exclusive processes in perturbative QCD predicts the behavior of the pion electromagnetic form factor $F(t)$ at asymptotic spacelike momenta $t(=-Q^2)<0$. We address the question of the onset energy using a suitable mathematical framework of analytic continuation, which uses as input the phase of the form factor below the first inelastic threshold, known with great precision through the Fermi-Watson theorem from $\pi\pi$ elastic scattering, and the modulus measured from threshold up to 3 GeV by the BaBar Collaboration. The method leads to almost model-independent upper and lower bounds on the spacelike form factor. Further inclusion of the value of the charge radius and the experimental value at $-2.45 \gev^2$ measured at JLab considerably increases the strength of the bounds in the region $ Q^2 \lesssim 10 \gev^2$, excluding the onset of the asymptotic perturbative QCD regime for $Q^2< 7\gev^2$.

Planck 2018 and Brane Inflation Revisited,The Closest View of a Fast Coronal Mass Ejection: How Faulty Assumptions near Perihelion Lead to Unrealistic Interpretations of PSP/WISPR Observations,False,"We revisit phenomenological as well as string-theoretical aspects of D-brane inflation cosmological models. Phenomenologically these models stand out on par with $\alpha$-attractors, as models with Planck-compatible values of $n_s$, moving down to the sweet spot in the data with decreasing value of $r$. On the formal side we present a new supersymmetric version of these models in the context of de Sitter supergravity with a nilpotent multiplet and volume modulus stabilization. The geometry of the nilpotent multiplet is evaluated in the framework of string theory.","We report on the closest view of a coronal mass ejection observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP)/Wide-field Imager for {Parker} Solar PRobe (WISPR) instrument on September 05, 2022, when PSP was traversing from a distance of 15.3~to~13.5~R$_\odot$ from the Sun. The CME leading edge and an arc-shaped {\emph{concave-up} structure near the core} was tracked in WISPR~field of view using the polar coordinate system, for the first time. Using the impact distance on Thomson surface, we measured average speeds of CME leading edge and concave-up structure as $\approx$2500~$\pm$~270\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and $\approx$400~$\pm$~70\,km\,s$^{-1}$ with a deceleration of $\approx$20~m~s$^{-2}$ for the later. {The use of the plane-of-sky approach yielded an unrealistic speed of more than three times of this estimate.} We also used single viewpoint STEREO/COR-2A images to fit the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to the CME while incorporating the source region location from EUI of Solar Orbiter and estimated a 3D speed of $\approx$2700\,km\,s$^{-1}$.

Phase stability of Fe from first-principles: atomistic spin dynamics coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic integration,Accurate calculation of the transverse anisotropy in perpendicularly magnetized multilayers,False,"The calculation of free energies from first principles in materials is a formidable task which enables the prediction of phase stability with high accuracy; these calculations are complicated in magnetic materials by the interplay of electronic, magnetic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. In this work, we show the feasibility and accuracy of the calculation of phase stability in magnetic systems with ab initio methods and thermodynamic integration by sampling the magnetic and vibrational phase space with coupled atomistic spin dynamics-ab initio molecular dynamics (ASD-AIMD) simulations [Stockem et al., PRL 121, 125902 (2018)], where energies and interatomic forces are calculated with density functional theory (DFT). We employ the method to calculate the phase stability of Fe at ambient pressure from 800 K up to 1800 K. The Gibbs free energy difference between fcc and bcc Fe at zero pressure as a function of temperature is calculated carrying out thermodynamic integration over temperature on the energies at the DFT level from ASD-AIMD, using a reference free energy difference calculated in the paramagnetic state at temperatures much higher than the magnetic transition temperatures with thermodynamic integration over stress-strain variables with disordered local moment (DLM)-AIMD simulations. We show the importance of the magnetic ordering temperature of bcc Fe on the $\alpha$ to $\gamma$ structural transition temperature, whereas the $\gamma$ to $\delta$ transition is well reproduced independently of the exchange interactions. The Gibbs free energy difference between the two structures is within 5 meV/atom from the CALPHAD estimate, and both transition temperatures are reproduced within 150 K. The present work paves the way to free energy calculations in magnetic materials from first principles with accuracy in the order of 1 meV/atom.","The transverse anisotropy constant and the related D\""oring mass density are key parameters of the one-dimensional model to describe the motion of magnetic domain walls. So far, no general framework is available to determine these quantities from static characterizations such as magnetometry measurements. Here, we derive a universal analytical expression to calculate the transverse anisotropy constant for the important class of perpendicular magnetic multilayers. All the required input parameters of the model, such as the number of repeats, the thickness of a single magnetic layer, and the layer periodicity, as well as the effective perpendicular anisotropy, the saturation magnetization, and the static domain wall width are accessible by static sample characterizations. We apply our model to a widely used multilayer system and find that the effective transverse anisotropy constant is a factor 7 different from the when using the conventional approximations, showing the importance of using our analysis scheme.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

"3.5 keV X-rays as the ""21 cm line"" of dark atoms, and a link to light sterile neutrinos",Phase Curves of Small Bodies from the SLOAN Moving Objects Catalog,False,"The recently discovered 3.5 keV X-ray line from extragalactic sources may be evidence of dark matter scatterings or decays. We show that dark atoms can be the source of the emission, through their hyperfine transitions, which would be the analog of 21 cm radiation from a dark sector. We identify two families of dark atom models that match the X-ray observations and are consistent with other constraints. In the first, the hyperfine excited state is long-lived compared to the age of the universe, and the dark atom mass is relatively unconstrained; dark atoms could be strongly self-interacting in this case. In the second, the excited state is short-lived and viable models are parameterized by the value of the dark proton-to-electron mass ratio $R$: for $R = 10^2-10^4$, the dark atom mass is predicted be in the range $350-1300$ GeV, with fine structure constant $\alpha'\cong 0.1-0.6$. In either class of models, the dark photon must be massive with $m_{\gamma'} \gtrsim$ 1 MeV and decay into $e^+ e^-$. Evidence for the model could come from direct detection of the dark atoms. In a natural extension of this framework, the dark photon could decay predominantly into invisible particles, for example $\sim 0.5$ eV sterile neutrinos, explaining the extra radiation degree of freedom recently suggested by data from BICEP2, while remaining compatible with BBN.","Extensive photometric surveys are and will continue producing massive amounts of data on small bodies. Usually, these data will be sparsely obtained at arbitrary (and unknown)rotational phases. Therefore, new methods to process such data need to be developed to make the most of those large catalogs. We aim to produce a method to create phase curves of small bodies considering the uncertainties introduced by the nominal errors in the magnitudes and the effect introduced by rotational variations. We use the SLOAN Moving Objects Catalog data as a benchmark to construct phase curves of all small bodies in there, in u', g', r', i', and z' filters. We will obtain from the phase curves the absolute magnitudes and set up with them the absolute colors, which are the colors of the asteroids not affected by changes in phase angle. We select objects with $\geq3$ observations taken in at least one filter and spanned over a minimum of 5 degrees in phase angle. We developed a method that combines Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference to estimate the absolute magnitudes using the HG$_{12}^*$ photometric system. We obtained almost 15\,000 phase curves, about 12,000 including all five filters. The absolute magnitudes and absolute colors are compatible with previously published data, supporting our method. The method we developed is fully automatic and well suited to be run on large amounts of data. Moreover, it includes the nominal uncertainties in the magnitudes and the whole distribution of possible rotational states of the objects producing, possibly, less precise values, i.e., larger uncertainties, but more accurate, i.e., closer to the actual value.

Phase-space distributions of nuclear short-range correlations,"Study of Azimuthal Correlations in the Target Fragmentation Region in p, d, He, C+C, Ta and C+Ne, Cu Collisions at a Momentum of 4.2, 4.5 and 10 AGeV/c",False,"Nuclear short-range correlations (SRCs) induce high-momentum/high-energy fluctuations in the nuclear medium. In order to assess their impact on nuclear bulk properties, like nuclear radii and kinetic energies, it is instrumental to determine how SRCs are distributed in phase space as this sheds light on the connection between their appearance in coordinate and momentum space. Using the lowest-order correlation operator approximation (LCA) to include SRC, we compute two-dimensional nuclear Wigner quasiprobability distributions $w(r, k)$ to locate those $({r}, {k})$ phase-space regions that are most heavily impacted by SRCs. The SRC-induced high-momentum components find their origin in a radial range that is confined to the nuclear interior. Significant SRCs strength is generated in the full momentum range $0 \leq k \lesssim 5 ~\text{fm}^{-1} $ covered in this work, but below the Fermi momentum those are dwarfed by the mean-field contributions. As an application of $w(r, k)$, we focus on the radial dependence of the kinetic energy $T$ and the momentum dependence of the radius $r_{\text{rms}}$ for the symmetric nuclei $^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca and the asymmetric nucleus $^{48}$Ca. The kinetic energy almost doubles after including SRCs, with the largest increase occurring in the nuclear interior $r \lesssim 2$ fm. The momentum dependence of the $r_{\text{rms}}$ teaches that the largest contributions stem from $k \lesssim 2 $ fm$^{-1}$, where the SRCs induce a slight reduction of the order of a few percent. The SRCs systematically reduce the $^{48}$Ca neutron skin by an amount that can be 10\%.","Azimuthal correlations between the same type of particles (protons or pions) in the target fragmentation region was studied in d, He, C + C, Ta (4.2 AGeV/c), C + Ne, Cu (4.5AGeV/c) and p + C, Ta (10 GeV/c) interactions. The data were obtained from the SKM-200-GIBS streamer chamber and from Propane Bubble Chamber (PBL-500) systems utilized at JINR. Study of multiparticle azimuthal correlations offers unique information about space-time evolution of the interactions. Azimuthal correlations were investigated by using correlation function C($\Delta\phi$)=dN/d($\Delta\phi$), where $\Delta\phi$ represents the angle between the sums of transverse momenta vectors for particles emitted in the forward and backward hemispheres. For protons a ""back-to back"" (""negative"") azimuthal correlations were observed in the above mentioned interactions. The absolute values of the correlation coefficient $|\xi|$ -- the slope parameter of C($\Delta\phi$), strongly depend on the mass number of the target ($A_T$) nuclei in the nucleon-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions. Namely, $|\xi|$ -- decreases with increase of $A_T$ in p+C and p+Ta collisions, while $|\xi|$ decreases from d+C up to C+Ne and then almost does not change with increase of $A_P$, $A_T$ in (d+He)Ta, C+Cu and C+Ta collisions. For pions a ""back-to-back"" correlations were obtained for a light targets (C, Ne), and a ""side-by-side"" (""positive"") correlations for a heavy targets (Cu, Ta).

Spectrum in the presence of brane-localized mass on torus extra dimensions,Constraining new physics in $b\to c\ell\nu$ transitions,False,"The lightest mass eigenvalue of a six-dimensional theory compactified on a torus is numerically evaluated in the presence of the brane-localized mass term. The dependence on the cutoff scale $\Lambda$ is non-negligible even when $\Lambda$ is two orders of magnitude above the compactification scale, which indicates that the mass eigenvalue is sensitive to the size of the brane, in contrast to five-dimensional theories. We obtain an approximate expression of the lightest mass in the thin brane limit, which well fits the numerical calculations, and clarifies its dependence on the torus moduli parameter $\tau$. We find that the lightest mass is typically much lighter than the compactification scale by an order of magnitude even in the limit of a large brane mass.","$B$ decays proceeding via $b\to c\ell\nu$ transitions with $\ell=e$ or $\mu$ are tree-level processes in the Standard Model. They are used to measure the CKM element $V_{cb}$, as such forming an important ingredient in the determination of e.g. the unitarity triangle; hence the question to which extent they can be affected by new physics contributions is important, specifically given the long-standing tension between $V_{cb}$ determinations from inclusive and exclusive decays and the significant hints for lepton flavour universality violation in $b\to c\tau\nu$ and $b\to s\ell\ell$ decays. We perform a comprehensive model-independent analysis of new physics in $b\to c\ell\nu$, considering all combinations of scalar, vector and tensor interactions occuring in single-mediator scenarios. We include for the first time differential distributions of $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ angular observables for this purpose. We show that these are valuable in constraining non-standard interactions. Specifically, the zero-recoil endpoint of the $B\to D\ell\nu$ spectrum is extremely sensitive to scalar currents, while the maximum-recoil endpoint of the $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ spectrum with transversely polarized $D^*$ is extremely sensitive to tensor currents. We also quantify the room for $e$-$\mu$ universality violation in $b\to c\ell\nu$ transitions, predicted by some models suggested to solve the $b\to c\tau\nu$ anomalies, from a global fit to $B\to D\ell\nu$ and $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ for the first time. Specific new physics models, corresponding to all possible tree-level mediators, are also discussed. As a side effect, we present $V_{cb}$ determinations from exclusive $B$ decays, both with frequentist and Bayesian statistics, leading to compatible results.

Classical Inflationary and Ekpyrotic Universes in the No-Boundary Wavefunction,X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations in Lense--Thirring precession model - I. variability of relativistic continuum,False,"This paper investigates the manner in which classical universes are obtained in the no-boundary quantum state. In this context, universes can be characterised as classical (in a WKB sense) when the wavefunction is highly oscillatory, i.e. when the ratio of the change in the amplitude of the wavefunction becomes small compared to the change in the phase. In the presence of a positive or negative exponential potential, the WKB condition is satisfied in proportion to a factor $e^{-(\epsilon - 3)N/(\epsilon -1)},$ where $\epsilon$ is the (constant) slow-roll/fast-roll parameter and $N$ designates the number of e-folds. Thus classicality is reached exponentially fast in $N$, but only when $\epsilon < 1$ (inflation) or $\epsilon > 3$ (ekpyrosis). Furthermore, when the potential switches off and the ekpyrotic phase goes over into a phase of kinetic domination, the level of classicality obtained up to that point is preserved. Similar results are obtained in a cyclic potential, where a dark energy plateau is added. Finally, for a potential of the form $-\phi^n$ (with $n=4,6,8$), where the classical solution becomes increasingly kinetic-dominated, there is an initial burst of classicalisation which then quickly levels off. These results demonstrate that inflation and ekpyrosis, which are the only dynamical mechanisms known for smoothing the universe, share the perhaps even more fundamental property of rendering space and time classical in the first place.","We develop a Monte-Carlo code to compute the Compton scattered X-ray flux arising from a hot inner flow which undergoes Lense-Thirring precession. The hot flow intercepts seed photons from an outer truncated thin disk. A fraction of the Comptonized photons will illuminate back the disk and the reflected/reprocessed photons will contribute to the observed spectrum. The total spectrum, including disk thermal emission, hot flow Comptonization, and disk reflection, is modelled within the framework of general relativity, taking light-bending and gravitational redshift into account. The simulations are performed in the context of the Lense-Thirring precession model for the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, so the inner flow is assumed to precess, leading to periodic modulation of the emitted radiation. In this work, we concentrate on the energy-dependent X-ray variability of the model and, in particular, on the evolution of the variability during the spectral transition from hard to soft state, which is implemented by the decrease of the truncation radius of the outer disk towards Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO). In the hard state where the Comptonizing flow is geometrically thick, the Comptonization is weakly variable with the fractional variability amplitude of $\leq$10\%; in the soft state where the Comptonizing flow is cooled down and thus becomes geometrically thin, and the fractional variability of the Comptonization is highly variable, increasing with photon energy. The fractional variability of the reflection increases with energy, and the reflection emission for low spin is counterintuitively more variable than the one for high spin.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Adatoms in graphene as a source of current polarization: Role of the local magnetic moment,Anharmonic effects in the A15 compounds induced by sublattice distortions,False,"We theoretically investigate spin-resolved currents flowing in large-area graphene, with and without defects, doped with single atoms of noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) and 3d-transition metals (Mn,Fe,Co and Ni). We show that the presence of a local magnetic moment is a necessary but not sufficient condition to have a non zero current polarization. An essential requirement is the presence of spin-split localized levels near the Fermi energy that strongly hybridize with the graphene pi-bands. We also show that a gate potential can be used to tune the energy of these localized levels, leading to an external way to control the degree of spin-polarized current without the application of a magnetic field.","We demonstrate that elastic anomalies and lattice instabilities in the the A15 compounds are describable in terms of first-principles LDA electronic structure calculations.

Order 1 autoregressive process of finite length,Fourier-Hermite spectral representation for the Vlasov-Poisson system in the weakly collisional limit,False,"The stochastic processes of finite length defined by recurrence relations request additional relations specifying the first terms of the process analogously to the initial conditions for the differential equations. As a general rule, in time series theory one analyzes only stochastic processes of infinite length which need no such initial conditions and their properties are less difficult to be determined. In this paper we compare the properties of the order 1 autoregressive processes of finite and infinite length and we prove that the time series length has an important influence mainly if the serial correlation is significant. These different properties can manifest themselves as transient effects produced when a time series is numerically generated. We show that for an order 1 autoregressive process the transient behavior can be avoided if the first term is a Gaussian random variable with standard deviation equal to that of the theoretical infinite process and not to that of the white noise innovation.","We study Landau damping in the 1+1D Vlasov-Poisson system using a Fourier-Hermite spectral representation. We describe the propagation of free energy in phase space using forwards and backwards propagating Hermite modes recently developed for gyrokinetics [Schekochihin et al. (2014)]. The change in the electric field corresponds to the net Hermite flux via a free energy evolution equation. In linear Landau damping, decay in the electric field corresponds to forward propagating Hermite modes; in nonlinear damping, the initial decay is followed by a growth phase characterised by the generation of backwards propagating Hermite modes by the nonlinear term. The free energy content of the backwards propagating modes increases exponentially until balancing that of the forward propagating modes. Thereafter there is no systematic net Hermite flux, so the electric field cannot decay and the nonlinearity effectively suppresses Landau damping. These simulations are performed using the fully-spectral 5D gyrokinetics code SpectroGK [Parker et al. 2014], modified to solve the 1+1D Vlasov-Poisson system. This captures Landau damping via an iterated L\'enard-Bernstein collision operator or via Hou-Li filtering in velocity space. Therefore the code is applicable even in regimes where phase-mixing and filamentation are dominant.","Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Data analysis, statistics and probability in physics focuses on methods, software and hardware for physics data analysis: data processing and storage; measurement methodology; statistical and mathematical aspects such as parametrization and uncertainties."
In-phase synchronization in complex oscillator networks by adaptive delayed feedback control,Breathers or quasibreathers?,False,"In-phase synchronization is a special case of synchronous behavior when coupled oscillators have the same phases for any time moments. Such behavior appears naturally for nearly identical coupled limit-cycle oscillators when the coupling strength is greatly above the synchronization threshold. We investigate the general class of nearly identical complex oscillators connected into network in a context of a phase reduction approach. By treating each oscillator as a black-box possessing a single-input single-output, we provide a practical and simply realizable control algorithm to attain the in-phase synchrony of the network. For a general diffusive-type coupling law and any value of a coupling strength (even greatly below the synchronization threshold) the delayed feedback control with a specially adjusted time-delays can provide in-phase synchronization. Such adjustment of the delay times performed in an automatic fashion by the use of an adaptive version of the delayed feedback algorithm when time-delays become time-dependent slowly varying control parameters. Analytical results show that there are many arrangements of the time-delays for the in-phase synchronization, therefore we supplement the algorithm by an additional requirement to choose appropriate set of the time-delays, which minimize power of a control force. Performed numerical validations of the predictions highlights the usefulness of our approach.","For the James breathers in the K2-K3-K4 chain and for breathers in the K4-chain, we prove numerically that these dynamical objects are not strictly time-periodic. Indeed, for the both cases, there exist certain deviations in the vibrational frequencies of the individual particles, which certainly exceed the possible numerical errors. We refer to the dynamical objects with such properties as quasibreathers. For the K4-chain, a rigorous investigation of existence and stability of the breathers and quasibreathers is presented. In particular, it is proved that they are stable up to a certain strength of the intersite part of the potential with respect to its on-site part. We conjecture that the main results of this paper are also valid in the general case and, therefore, it seems that one must speak about quasibreathers rather than about strictly time-periodic breathers.",Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems,"Adaptation and self-organizing systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that exhibit adaptive behavior and self-organization.

Erbium-doped aluminophosphosilicate all-fiber laser operating at 1584 nm,Generation of reference dc currents at 1 nA level with the capacitance-charging method,False,"We report on an ytterbium-free erbium-doped aluminophosphosilicate all-fiber laser, producing an output power of 25 W at a wavelength of 1584 nm with a slope efficiency of 30% with respect to the 976 nm absorbed pump power. The simple cavity design proposed takes advantage of fiber Bragg gratings written directly in the gain fiber. The single-mode erbium-doped aluminophosphosilicate fiber was fabricated in-house and was doped with 0.06 mol.% of Er2O3, 1.77 mol.% of Al2O3 and 1.04 mol.% of P2O5. The incorporation of aluminium and phosphorus into the fiber core allowed for an increased concentration of erbium without inducing significant clustering, while keeping the numerical aperture low to ensure a single-mode laser operation.","The capacitance-charging method is a well-established and handy technique for the generation of dc current in the 100 pA range or lower. The method involves a capacitance standard and a sampling voltmeter, highly stable devices easy to calibrate, and it is robust and insensitive to the voltage burden of the instrument being calibrated. We propose here a range extender amplifier, which can be employed as a plug-in component in existing calibration setups, and allows the generation of currents in the 1 nA range. The extender has been employed in the INRIM setup and validated with two comparisons at 100 pA and 1 nA current level.

Radiation of caustic beams from a collapsing bullet,On the dynamics of the singularities of the solutions of some non-linear integrable differential equations,False,"Collapse of an intense (2+1)-dimensional wave packet in a medium with cubic nonlinearity and a two-dimensional dispersion of an order higher than parabolic is studied both theoretically and experimentally. The carrier waves are microwave backward volume spin waves which propagate in a stripe made from a thin ferrimagnetic film and the packet is a spin-wave bullet. We show that before being self-destroyed the bullet irradiates untrapped dispersive waves, which is in agreement with a previous theoretical prediction. Since, in addition, the ferromagnetic medium is characterized by an induced uniaxial anisotropy, this radiation takes the form of narrow beams of continuous waves at very specific angles to its propagation direction. Based on our theoretical calculations we find that these beams are caustic beams and the angles are the characteristic spin-wave caustic angles modified by the motion of the source.","This paper concerns with some of the results related to the singular solutions of certain types of non-linear integrable differential equations (NIDE) and behavior of the singularities of those equations. The approach heavily relies on the Method of Operator Identities which proved to be a powerful tool in different areas such as interpolation problems, spectral analysis, inverse spectral problems, dynamic systems, non-linear equations. We formulate and solve a number of problems (direct and inverse) related to the singular solutions of sinh-Gordon, non-linear Schr\""{o}dinger and modified Korteweg - de Vries equations. Dynamics of the singularities of these solutions suggests that they can be interpreted in terms of particles interacting through the fields surrounding them.

Off-resonant all-optical switching dynamics in a ferromagnetic model system,Room-temperature Low-field Colossal Magneto-resistance in Double-perovskite Manganite,False,"We present a theoretical study of the the effects of off-resonant polarized optical fields on a ferromagnetic model system. We determine the light-induced dynamics of itinerant carriers in a system that includes magnetism at the mean-field level and spin-orbit coupling. We investigate an all-optical switching process for ferromagnets, which is close to the one proposed by Qaiumzadeh et al. [Phys. Rev. B 88, 064416] for the inverse Faraday effect. By computing the optically driven coherent dynamics together with incoherent scattering mechanisms we go beyond a perturbation expansion in powers of the optical field. We find an important contribution of a dynamic Stark effect coupling of the Raman type between the magnetic bands, which leads to a polarization-dependent effect on the magnetization that may support or oppose switching, but also contributes to demagnetization via an increase in electronic energy.","The gigantic decrease of resistance by an applied magnetic field, which is often referred to as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), has been an attracting phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. The discovery of CMR in manganese oxide compounds has developed the science of strong coupling among charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom. CMR is also attracting scientists from the viewpoint of possible applications to sensors, memories, and so on. However, no application using CMR effect has been achieved so far, partly because the CMR materials which satisfy all of the required conditions for the application, namely, high operating temperature, low operating magnetic field, and sharp resistive change, have not been discovered. Here we report a resistance change of more than two-orders of magnitude at a magnetic field lower than 2 T near 300 K in an A-site ordered NdBaMn_2_O_6_ crystal. When temperature and a magnetic field sweep from insulating (metallic) phase to metallic (insulating) phase, the insulating (metallic) conduction changes to the metallic (insulating) conduction within 1 K and 0.5 T, respectively. The CMR is ascribed to the melting of the charge ordering. The entropy change which is estimated from the B-T phase diagram is smaller than what is expected for the charge and orbital ordering. The suppression of the entropy change is attributable to the loss of the short range ferromagnetic fluctuation of Mn spin moments, which an important key of the high temperature and low magnetic field CMR effect.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Quartet condensation induced by the isovector pairing force,Beta-decay spectroscopy of $^{27}$S,False,"The phenomenon of quartet condensation in the ground state of an isovector pairing Hamiltonian for an even-even $N=Z$ system is investigated. For this purpose we follow the evolution of the ground state from an unperturbed regime up to a strongly interacting one in a formalism of collective pairs. These pairs are those resulting from the diagonalization of the pairing Hamiltonian in a space of two particles coupled to isospin $T=1$. The ground state is found to rapidly evolve from a product of distinct $T=0$ quartets, each one formed by two of the above pairs, to a condensate of identical quartets built only with the pair corresponding to the lowest energy. This finding establishes a link between the complicated structure of the exact ground state and the simple approximation scheme of the Quartet Condensation Model. The mechanism at the basis of this quartet condensation turns out to be the same which is responsible for the development of a pair condensate in the ground state of a like-particle pairing Hamiltonian.","Background: Beta-decay spectroscopy provides valuable nuclear physics input for thermonuclear reaction rates of astrophysical interest and stringent test for shell-model theories far from the stability line. Purpose: The available decay properties of proton drip-line nucleus $^{27}$S is insufficient to constrain the properties of the key resonance in $^{26}$Si$(p,\gamma)^{27}$P reaction rate and probe the possible isospin asymmetry. The decay scheme of $^{27}$S is complicated and far from being understood, which has motivated but also presented challenges for our experiment. Method: The $^{27}$S ions were implanted into a double-sided silicon strip detector array surrounded by the high-purity germanium detectors, where the $\beta$-delayed protons and $\gamma$ rays were measured simultaneously. Results: The improved spectroscopic properties including the precise half-life of $^{27}$S, the excitation energies, $\beta$-decay branching ratios, log~$ft$ values, and $B$(GT) values for the states of $^{27}$P populated in the $\beta$ decay of $^{27}$S were measured and compared to the $^{27}$Mg mirror states and the shell-model calculations. The present work has expanded greatly on the previously established decay scheme of $^{27}$S. Conclusions: The precise proton-separation energy of $^{27}$P, the energy and the ratio between $\gamma$ and proton partial widths of the $3/2^+$ resonance were obtained, thereby determining the $^{26}$Si$(p,\gamma)^{27}$P reaction rate based mainly on experimental constraints. The first evidence for the observation of a large isospin asymmetry for the mirror decays of $^{27}$S and $^{27}$Na is also provided.

Magnetic field dependence of the neutral pion longitudinal screening mass in the linear sigma model with quarks,N=2 and N=4 Supersymmetric mKdV and sinh-Gordon Hierarchies,False,"We use the Linear Sigma Model with quarks to study the magnetic field-induced modifications on the longitudinal screening mass for the neutral pion at one-loop level. The effects of the magnetic field are introduced into the self-energy which contains the contributions from all the model particles. We find that to obtain a reasonable description for the behavior with the field strength, the magnetic field dependence of the particle masses need to be accounted for. We also find that the couplings need to decrease fast enough with the field strength to then reach constant and smaller values as compared to their vacuum ones. The results illustrate the need to treat the magnetic corrections to the particle masses and couplings in a self-consistent manner, accounting for the back reaction of the field effects for the magnetic field dependence of the rest of the particle species and couplings in the model.",Integrable models with higher N=2 and N=4 supersymmetries are formulated on reductions of twisted loop superalgebras $\hat{sl}(2|2)$ and $\hat{sl}(4|4) $ endowed with principal gradation.

Cutoff effects of heavy quark vacuum polarization at one-loop order,Singularities of plane gravitational waves and their memory effects,False,The charm-quark mass is typically not so far from the cutoff 1/a in lattice simulations. Its determinant may then potentially introduce large cutoff effects. We choose the O(a)-improved Wilson formulation and compute the vacuum polarization effects in two rather different observables at one-loop order. One is the quark-antiquark static force and the other the Schroedinger functional coupling; in addition we investigate two more quantities resulting from the latter. In all the cases the lattice artifacts due to the charm-quark are small when compared to the gluonic effects. This indicates that the inclusion of charm-quarks in dynamical fermion simulations is typically not a problem.,"Similar to the Schwarzschild coordinates for spherical black holes, the Baldwin, Jeffery and Rosen (BJR) coordinates for plane gravitational waves are often singular, and extensions beyond such singularities are necessary, before studying asymptotic properties of such spacetimes at the null infinity of the plane, on which the gravitational waves propagate. The latter is closely related to the studies of memory effects and soft graviton theorems. In this paper, we point out that in the BJR coordinates all the spacetimes are singular physically at the focused point $u = u_s$, except for the two cases: (1) $\alpha =1/2, \; \forall \; \chi_n$; and (2) $\alpha =1, \; \chi_i = 0\; (i = 1, 2, 3)$, where $\chi_n$ are the coefficients in the expansion $\chi \equiv \left[{\mbox{det}}\left(g_{ab}\right) \right]^{1/4} = \left(u - u_s\right)^{\alpha}\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\chi_n \left(u - u_s\right)^n$ with $\chi_0 \not= 0$, the constant $\alpha \in (0, 1]$ characterizes the strength of the singularities, and $g_{ab}$ denotes the reduced metric on the two-dimensional plane orthogonal to the propagation direction of the wave. Therefore, the hypersurfaces $u= u_s$ already represent the boundaries of such spacetimes, and the null infinity does not belong to them. As a result, they cannot be used to study properties of plane gravitational waves at null infinities, including memory effects and soft graviton theorems.",High Energy Physics - Lattice,"High energy physics - lattice focuses on lattice field theory as a method to investigate the properties of quantum fields and strongly interacting systems, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons.

On a Conjecture of Givental,New physics in $b \to s e^+ e^-$?,False,"These brief notes record our puzzles and findings surrounding Givental's recent conjecture which expresses higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants in terms of the genus-0 data. We limit our considerations to the case of a projective line, whose Gromov-Witten invariants are well-known and easy to compute. We make some simple checks supporting his conjecture.","At present, the measurements of some observables in $B \to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$ and $B_s^0 \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays, and of $R_{K^{(*)}} \equiv {\cal B}(B \to K^{(*)} \mu^+ \mu^-)/{\cal B}(B \to K^{(*)} e^+ e^-)$, are in disagreement with the predictions of the standard model. While most of these discrepancies can be removed with the addition of new physics (NP) in $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$, a difference of $>\sim 1.7 \sigma$ still remains in the measurement of $R_{K^*}$ at small values of $q^2$, the dilepton invariant mass-squared. In the context of a global fit, this is not a problem. However, it does raise the question: if the true value of $R_{K^*}^{low}$ is near its measured value, what is required to explain it? In this paper, we show that, if one includes NP in $b \to s e^+ e^-$, one can generate values for $R_{K^*}^{low}$ that are within $\sim 1\sigma$ of its measured value. Using a model-independent, effective-field-theory approach, we construct many different possible NP scenarios. We also examine specific models containing leptoquarks or a $Z'$ gauge boson. Here, additional constraints from lepton-flavour-violating observables, $B_s^0$-${\bar B}_s^0$ mixing and neutrino trident production must be taken into account, but we still find a number of viable NP scenarios. For the various scenarios, we examine the predictions for $R_{K^{(*)}}$ in other $q^2$ bins, as well as for the observable $Q_5 \equiv P^{\prime\mu\mu}_5 -P^{\prime ee}_5$.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Evidences for higher nocturnal seismic activity at the Mt. Vesuvius,Direct van der Waals simulation (DVS) of phase-transforming fluids,False,"We analyze hourly seismic data measured at the Osservatorio Vesuviano Ovest (OVO, 1972-2014) and at the Bunker Est (BKE, 1999-2014) stations on the Mt. Vesuvius. The OVO record is complete for seismic events with magnitude M > 1.9. We demonstrate that before 1996 this record presents a daily oscillation that nearly vanishes afterwards. To determine whether a daily oscillation exists in the seismic activity of the Mt. Vesuvius, we use the higher quality BKE record that is complete for seismic events with magnitude M > 0.2. We demonstrate that BKE confirms that the seismic activity at the Mt. Vesuvius is higher during nighttime than during day-time. The amplitude of the daily oscillation is enhanced during summer and damped during winter. We speculate possible links with the cooling/warming diurnal cycle of the volcanic edifice, with external geomagnetic field and with magnetostriction that should also stress the rocks. We find that the amplitude of the seismic daily cycle changes in time and has been increasing since 2008. Finally, we propose a seismic activity index to monitor the 24-hour oscillation that could be used to complement other methodologies currently adopted to determine the seismic status of the volcano and to prevent the relative hazard.","We present the method of Direct van der Waals simulation (DVS) to study computationally flows with liquid-vapor phase transformations.

Pseudoquatum Features of Parametrically Driven Classical Fluids,Weakly Chaotic Population Dynamics in Random Ecological Networks,False,"Recent experiments on walking droplets suggest an underlying connection between fluid dynamics and the quantum mechanics. Such experiments may be used to support the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory. In this paper we show that many quantum-like features of hydrodynamic excitations can be explained in the framework of the parametrically driven nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (DNLSE). It is shown that the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (NLSE) describes the pseudoquantum features of a given pseudoparticle in the Sagdeev pseudopotential just as the ordinary linear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (LSE) describes the quantum nature of real particles. The NLSE is shown to reduce to nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation (NHJE) for the phase function of the complex wavefunction. The origin of the wave-particle dual-character in both LSE and NLSE is explained and basic similarities between the two models is highlighted. It is shown that many more pseudoquantum effects (yet to be explored) such as pseudoentanglement, self-interference effect and quantization of pseudoparticle energy are inherent features of classical fluids. Current investigation suggests that emergence of the quantum nature of fluids is independent from dynamics of the bouncing droplets or their interactions with the surface waves instantaneously created by them. In contrast to previous suggestions, it is remarked that intrinsically nonlinear collective excitations of a fluid can drive any particle even a pseudoparticle to behave quantum mechanically. These collective interactions in hydrodynamic model confirm the important nonlocal character (which is a key aspect of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory) of all the pseudoquantum phenomena. The recent hydrodynamic quantum analog experiments and extensive new theoretical models may hopefully enable physicists to unlock the decade long hidden mystery of the quantum weirdness.","Population dynamics in random ecological networks are investigated by analyzing a simple deterministic equation. It is found that a sequence of abrupt changes of populations punctuating quiescent states characterize the long time behavior.

Evidence for the Jacobi shape transition in hot 46Ti,Heavy quark fragmentation functions at next-to-leading perturbative QCD,False,"The gamma-rays from the decay of the GDR in 46Ti compound nucleus formed in the 18O+28Si reaction at bombarding energy 105 MeV have been measured in an experiment using a setup consisting of the combined EUROBALL IV, HECTOR and EUCLIDES arrays. A comparison of the extracted GDR lineshape data with the predictions of the thermal shape fluctuation model shows evidence for the Jacobi shape transition in hot 46Ti. In addition to the previously found broad structure in the GDR lineshape region at 18-27 MeV caused by large deformations, the presence of a low energy component (around 10 MeV), due to the Coriolis splitting in prolate well deformed shape, has been identified for the first time.","It is well-known that the dominant mechanism to produce hadronic bound states with large transverse momentum is fragmentation. This mechanism is described by the fragmentation functions (FFs) which are the universal and process-independent functions. Here, we review the perturbative FFs formalism as an appropriate tool for studying these hadronization processes and detail the extension of this formalism at next-to-leading order (NLO). Using the Suzuki's model, we calculate the perturbative QCD FF for a heavy quark to fragment into a S-wave heavy meson at NLO.

First demonstration of OH suppression in a high efficiency near-infrared spectrograph,The Luminosity Function of Red Supergiants in M31,False,"Ground-based near-infrared astronomy is severely hampered by the forest of atmospheric emission lines resulting from the rovibrational decay of OH molecules in the upper atmosphere. The extreme brightness of these lines, as well as their spatial and temporal variability, makes accurate sky subtraction difficult. Selectively filtering these lines with OH suppression instruments has been a long standing goal for near-infrared spectroscopy. We have shown previously the efficacy of fibre Bragg gratings combined with photonic lanterns for achieving OH suppression. Here we report on PRAXIS, a unique near-infrared spectrograph that is optimised for OH suppression with fibre Bragg gratings. We show for the first time that OH suppression (of any kind) is possible with high overall throughput (18 per cent end-to-end), and provide examples of the relative benefits of OH suppression.","The mass-loss rates of red supergiant stars (RSGs) are poorly constrained by direct measurements, and yet the subsequent evolution of these stars depends critically on how much mass is lost during the RSG phase. In 2012 the Geneva evolutionary group updated their mass-loss prescription for RSGs with the result that a 20 solar mass star now loses 10x more mass during the RSG phase than in the older models. Thus, higher mass RSGs evolve back through a second yellow supergiant phase rather than exploding as Type II-P supernovae, in accord with recent observations (the so-called ""RSG Problem""). Still, even much larger mass-loss rates during the RSG phase cannot be ruled out by direct measurements of their current dust-production rates, as such mass-loss is episodic. Here we test the models by deriving a luminosity function for RSGs in the nearby spiral galaxy M31 which is sensitive to the total mass loss during the RSG phase. We carefully separate RSGs from asymptotic giant branch stars in the color-magnitude diagram following the recent method exploited by Yang and collaborators in their Small Magellanic Cloud studies. Comparing our resulting luminosity function to that predicted by the evolutionary models shows that the new prescription for RSG mass-loss does an excellent job of matching the observations, and we can readily rule out significantly larger values.",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"Instrumentation and methods for astrophysics focuses on detector and telescope design, experiment proposals.

Graphene-based Perfect Absorbers: Systematic Design and High Tunability,The impact of introductory physics for the life sciences in a senior biology capstone course,False,"Experimental realization of efficient graphene-based absorbers is a challenging task due to the low carrier mobility in processed graphene. In this paper, we circumvent this problem by placing uniform graphene sheets on metallic metasurfaces designed for improving the absorption properties of low-mobility graphene. Complete absorption can be achieved for different frequencies with the proper metasurface design. In the THz band, we observe strong tunability of the absorption frequencies and magnitudes when modulating graphene Fermi level.","A goal of Introductory Physics for Life Sciences (IPLS) curricula is to prepare students to effectively use physical models and quantitative reasoning in biological and medical settings.

We report here on one part of that study, a comparison of written responses by students with different physics backgrounds on a diffusion task administered in a senior biology capstone course. We observed differences in student reasoning that were associated with prior or concurrent enrollment in IPLS. In particular, we found that IPLS students were more likely than non-IPLS students to reason quantitatively and mechanistically about diffusive phenomena, and to successfully coordinate between multiple representations of diffusive processes, even up to two years after taking the IPLS course.

Penetrating probes: Jets and photons in a non-equilibrium quark-gluon plasma,Neutral to charged kaon yield fluctuations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76TeV,False,We employ new field-theoretical tools to study photons and jets in a non-equilibrium quark-gluon plasma. Jet broadening and photon emission takes place through radiation which is suppressed by repeated and coherent interaction with the medium. We analyze this physics in an anisotropic plasma such as is created in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. The anisotropy introduces an angular dependence in radiation and reduces its overall rate. This can affect phenomenological predictions of the rapidity dependence and angular flow of jets and photons.,"We present the first measurement of event-by-event fluctuations in the kaon sector in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt {s_{\rm NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The robust fluctuation correlator $\nu_{\rm dyn}$ is used to evaluate the magnitude of fluctuations of the relative yields of neutral and charged kaons, as well as the relative yields of charged kaons, as a function of collision centrality and selected kinematic ranges. While the correlator $\nu_{\rm dyn}[\rm K^+,\rm K^-]$ exhibits a scaling approximately in inverse proportion of the charged particle multiplicity, $\nu_{\rm dyn}[\rm K_S^0,\rm K^{\pm}]$ features a significant deviation from such scaling. Within uncertainties, the value of $\nu_{\rm dyn}[\rm K_S^0,\rm K^{\pm}]$ is independent of the selected transverse momentum interval, while it exhibits a pseudorapidity dependence.

Varying constants driven baryogenesis,Complex instantons in sigma models with chemical potential,False,"We study the spontaneous baryogenesis scenario in the early universe for three different frameworks of varying constants theories. We replace the constants by dynamical scalar fields playing the role of thermions. We first obtain the results for baryogenesis driven by the varying gravitational constant, $G$, as in the previous literature, then challenge the problem for varying fine structure constant $\alpha$ models as well as for varying speed of light $c$ models. We show that in each of these frameworks the current observational value of the baryon to entropy ratio, $\eta_B \sim 8.6 \cdot 10^{-11}$, can be obtained for large set of parameters of dynamical constants models as well as the decoupling temperature, and the characteristic cut-off length scale.","We analyze two-dimensional nonlinear sigma models at nonzero chemical potentials, which are governed by a complex action.

We write down the equations of motion and find exact BPS-like solutions in terms of pairs of (anti)holomorphic functions, in particular generalizations of unit charge and fractional instantons to generic mu.

We make use of accurate structural parameters derived from i-band bulge/disc/bar decompositions to show that, as a population, barred discs tend to have fainter central surface brightness (Delta mu_0 ~ 0.25 mag), and disc scale lengths that are ~15 per cent larger than those of unbarred galaxies of the same stellar mass. The corresponding distributions of mu_0 and h are statistically inconsistent at the 5.2 sigma and 3.8 sigma levels, respectively. Bars rarely occur in high-surface brightness discs, with less than 5 per cent of the barred population having mu_0 < 19.5 mag arcsec^-2 -- compared to 20 per cent for unbarred galaxies. They tend to reside in moderately blue discs, with a bar fraction that peaks at (g-i)_disc ~ 0.95 mag and mildly declines for both bluer and redder colours. These results demonstrate noticeable structural differences between the discs of barred and unbarred galaxies, which we argue are the result of bar-driven evolution -- in qualitative agreement with longstanding theoretical expectations.",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"Instrumentation and methods for astrophysics focuses on detector and telescope design, experiment proposals.

Forward Physics at the LHC,Renormalized Polyakov loops in various representations in finite temperature SU(2) gauge theory,False,"Small-angle detectors at the LHC give access to a broad physics programme within and beyond the Standard Model (SM). We review the capabilities of ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, LHCf and TOTEM for forward physics studies in various sectors: soft and hard diffractive processes, exclusive Higgs production, low-x QCD, ultra-high-energy cosmic-rays, and electro-weak measurements.","We present results for the renormalized Polyakov loop in the three lowest irreducible representations of SU(2) gauge theory at finite temperature.

Testing Gaussianity in the WMAP data of OT foreground reduced map,Weather on Other Worlds. VI. Optical Spectrophotometry of Luhman 16B Reveals Large-amplitude Variations in the Alkali Lines,False,"A considerable effort has recently gone into the study of Gaussianity of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Among such attempts, there is one with two non-Gaussianity indicators, proposed by the authors, and used in a search for significant deviation from Gaussianity in the WMAP internal linear combination (ILC) and in the single frequency WMAP maps with the KQ75 mask. Here we extend and complement these results by performing a similar analysis for the de Oliveira-Costa and Tegmark (OT) WMAP three-year $KQ75$ masked map, in which the foreground is reduced through a different statistical cleaning procedure.","Using a novel wide-slit, multi-object approach with the GMOS spectrograph on the 8-meter Gemini South telescope, we have obtained precise time-series spectrophotometry of the binary brown dwarf Luhman 16 at optical wavelengths over two full nights. The B component of this binary system is known to be variable in the red optical and near-infrared with a period of 5 hr and an amplitude of 5--20%. Our observations probe its spectrally-resolved variability in the 6000--10000 Angstrom range. At wavelengths affected by the extremely strong, broadened spectral lines of the neutral alkali metals (the potassium doublet centered near 7682 Angstroms and the sodium doublet at 5893 Angstroms), we see photometric variations that differ strikingly from the those of the 8000--10000 Angstrom `red continuum' that dominates our detected flux. On UT 2014 February 24, these variations are anticorrelated with the red continuum, while on Feb 25 they have a large relative phase shift. The extent to which the wavelength-dependent photometric behavior diverges from that of the red continuum appears to correlate with the strength of the alkali absorption. We consider but ultimately reject models in which our observations are explained by lightning or auroral activity. A more likely cause is cloud-correlated, altitude-dependent variations in the gas-phase abundances of sodium and potassium, which are in chemical equilibrium with their chlorides in brown dwarf atmospheres. Clouds could influence these chemical equilibria by changing the atmospheric temperature profile and/or through cloud particles acting as chemical catalysts.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Three dimensional bright vortex soliton,Amplifying Phenomenal Information: Toward a Fundamental Theory of Consciousness,False,"Using the method of separation of variables, we developed a vector nonparaxial theory for the nonlinear wave equations in strong field approximation. We found that exact localized vortex soliton solution exists for the nonlinear 3D+1 vector wave equation and for 3D+1 vector nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation. This method is applicable for angular functions, which satisfy additional conditions. It is shown that exact vortex solitary wave exists only for solution with eigenvalue of momentum L=1","Fundamental approaches bypass the problem of getting consciousness from non-conscious components by positing that consciousness is a universal primitive. For example, the double aspect theory of information holds that information has a phenomenal aspect. How then do you get from phenomenal information to human consciousness? This paper proposes that an entity is conscious to the extent it amplifies information, first by trapping and integrating it through closure, and second by maintaining dynamics at the edge of chaos through simultaneous processes of divergence and convergence. The origin of life through autocatalytic closure, and the origin of an interconnected worldview through conceptual closure, induced phase transitions in the degree to which information, and thus consciousness, is locally amplified. Divergence and convergence of cognitive information may involve phenomena observed in light e.g. focusing, interference, and resonance. By making information flow inward-biased, closure shields us from external consciousness; thus the paucity of consciousness may be an illusion.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Two-point correlation function studies for the Milky Way: discovery of spatial clustering from disk excitations and substructure,Testing protoplanetary disc dispersal with radio emission,False,"We introduce a two-particle correlation function (2PCF) for the Milky Way, constructed to probe spatial correlations in the orthogonal directions of the stellar disk in the Galactic cylindrical coordinates of $R$, $\phi$, and $z$. We use this new tool to probe the structure and dynamics of the Galaxy using the carefully selected set of solar neighborhood stars ($d \lesssim 3\, \rm kpc$) from Gaia Data Release 2 we previously employed for studies of axial symmetry breaking in stellar number counts. We make additional, extensive tests, comparing to reference numerical simulations, to ensure our control over possibly confounding systematic effects. Supposing either axial or North-South symmetry we divide this data set into two nominally symmetric sectors and construct the 2PCF, in the manner of the Landy-Szalay estimator, from the Gaia data. In so doing, working well away from the mid-plane region in which the spiral arms appear, we have discovered distinct symmetry-breaking patterns in the 2PCF in its orthogonal directions, thus establishing the existence of correlations in stellar number counts at sub-kiloparsec length scales for the very first time. Particularly, we observe extensive wave-like structures of amplitude greatly in excess of what we would estimate if the system were in a steady state. We study the variations in these patterns across the Galactic disk, and with increasing $|z|$, and we show how our results complement other observations of non-steady-state effects near the Sun, such as vertical asymmetries in stellar number counts and the Gaia snail.","We consider continuum free-free radio emission from the upper atmosphere of protoplanetary discs as a probe of the ionized luminosity impinging upon the disc. Making use of previously computed hydrodynamic models of disc photoevaporation within the framework of EUV and X-ray irradiation, we use radiative transfer post-processing techniques to predict the expected free-free emission from protoplanetary discs. In general, the free-free luminosity scales roughly linearly with ionizing luminosity in both EUV and X-ray driven scenarios, where the emission dominates over the dust tail of the disc and is partial optically thin at cm wavelengths. We perform a test observation of GM Aur at 14-18 Ghz and detect an excess of radio emission above the dust tail to a very high level of confidence. The observed flux density and spectral index are consistent with free-free emission from the ionized disc in either the EUV or X-ray driven scenario. Finally, we suggest a possible route to testing the EUV and X-ray driven dispersal model of protoplanetary discs, by combining observed free-free flux densities with measurements of mass-accretion rates. On the point of disc dispersal one would expect to find a M_dot^2 scaling with free-free flux in the case of EUV driven disc dispersal or a M_dot scaling in the case of X-ray driven disc dispersal.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Heavy and light flavor jet quenching in different collision systems at the LHC energies,Production mechanism of neutron-deficient actinide isotopes in complete fusion reactions and multinucleon transfer reactions,False,"Recent experiments have observed large anisotropic collective flows in high multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which indicates the possible formation of mini quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in small collision systems. However, no jet quenching has been confirmed in such small systems so far. To understand this intriguing result, the system size scan experiments have been proposed to bridge the gap between large and small systems. In this work, we perform a systematic study on both heavy and light flavor jet quenching in different collision systems at the LHC energies. Using our state-of-the-art jet quenching model, which combines the next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD framework, a linear Boltzmann transport model and the (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics simulation, we provide a good description of nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ for charged hadrons and $D$ mesons in central and mid-central Pb+Pb and Xe+Xe collisions measured by CMS collaboration. We further predict the transverse momentum and centrality dependences of $R_{AA}$ for charged hadrons, $D$ and $B$ mesons in Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, Ar+Ar and O+O collisions at the LHC energies. Our numerical results show a clear system size dependence for both light and heavy flavor hadron $R_{AA}$ across different collision systems. Sizable jet quenching effect is obtained for both heavy and light flavor hadrons in central O+O collisions at the LHC energies. Our study provides a significant bridge for jet quenching from large to small systems, and should be helpful for finding the smallest QGP droplet and the disappearance of QGP in relativistic nuclear collisions.","Within the dinuclear system model, unknown neutron-deficient isotopes Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm are investigated in $^{40}$Ca, $^{36,40}$Ar, $^{32}$S, $^{28}$Si,$^{24}$Mg induced fusion-evaporation reactions and multinucleon transfer reactions with radioactive beams $^{59}$Cu,$^{69}$As,$^{90}$Nb,$^{91}$Tc, $^{94}$Rh, $^{105,110}$Sn, $^{118}$Xe induced with $^{238}$U near Coulomb barrier energies. The production cross sections of compound nuclei in the fusion-evaporation reactions and fragments yields in the multinucleon transfer reactions are calculated within the model. A statistical approach is used to evaluate the survival probability of excited nuclei via the both reaction mechanisms. A dynamical deformation is implemented into the model in the dissipation process. It is found that charge particle channels (alpha and proton) dominate in the decay process of proton-rich nuclides and the fusion-evaporation reactions are favorable to produce the new neutron-deficient actinide isotopes.

Evidence for the disintegration of KIC 12557548 b,Ultrarelativistic black hole formation,False,"Context. The Kepler object KIC 12557548 b is peculiar. It exhibits transit-like features every 15.7 hours that vary in depth between 0.2% and 1.2%. Rappaport et al. (2012) explain the observations in terms of a disintegrating, rocky planet that has a trailing cloud of dust created and constantly replenished by thermal surface erosion. The variability of the transit depth is then a consequence of changes in the cloud optical depth. Aims. We aim to validate the disintegrating-planet scenario by modeling the detailed shape of the observed light curve, and thereby constrain the cloud particle properties to better understand the nature of this intriguing object. Methods. We analysed the six publicly-available quarters of raw Kepler data, phase-folded the light curve and fitted it to a model for the trailing dust cloud. Constraints on the particle properties were investigated with a light-scattering code. Results. The light curve exhibits clear signatures of light scattering and absorption by dust, including a brightening in flux just before ingress correlated with the transit depth and explained by forward scattering, and an asymmetry in the transit light curve shape, which is easily reproduced by an exponentially decaying distribution of optically thin dust, with a typical grain size of 0.1 micron. Conclusions. Our quantitative analysis supports the hypothesis that the transit signal of KIC 12557548 b is due to a variable cloud of dust, most likely originating from a disintegrating object.","We study the ultrarelativistic head-on collision of equal mass particles, modeled as self-gravitating fluid spheres, by numerically solving the coupled Einstein-hydrodynamic equations. We focus on cases well within the kinetic energy dominated regime, where between 88-92% ($\gamma=8$ to 12) of the initial net energy of the spacetime resides in the translation kinetic energy of the particles. We find that for sufficiently large boosts, black hole formation occurs. Moreover, near yet above the threshold of black hole formation, the collision initially leads to the formation of two distinct apparent horizons that subsequently merge. We argue that this can be understood in terms of a focusing effect, where one boosted particle acts as a gravitational lens on the other and vice versa, and that this is further responsible for the threshold being lower (by a factor of a few) compared to simple hoop conjecture estimates. Cases slightly below threshold result in complete disruption of the model particles. The gravitational radiation emitted when black holes form reaches luminosities of 0.014 $c^5/G$, carrying $16\pm2%$ of the total energy.",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"Earth and planetary astrophysics focuses on interplanetary medium, planetary physics, planetary astrobiology, extrasolar planets, comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

Nondecay probability of a metastable state: almost exact analytical description in wide range of noise intensity,Dissipative dynamics of a charged particle in the field of three plane waves: chaos and control,False,This paper presents a complete description of noise-induced decay of a metastable state in a wide range of noise intensity. Recurrent formulas of exact moments of decay time valid for arbitrary noise intensity have been obtained. The nondecay probability of a metastable state was found to be really close to the exponent even for the case when the potential barrier height is comparable or smaller than the noise intensity.,"The chaotic dissipative dynamics of a charged particle in the field of three plane waves is theoretically (Melnikov's method) and numerically (Lyapunov exponents) investigated. In particular, the effectiveness of one of such waves in controlling the chaotic dynamics induced by the remaining two waves is theoretically predicted and numerically confirmed. Two mechanisms underlying the chaos-suppression scenario are identified. One mechanism requires chaos-inducing and chaos-suppressing waves to have both commensurate wavelengths and commensurate relative (with respect to the remaining third wave) phase velocities, while the other mechanism allows the chaotic dynamics to be tamed when such quantities are incommensurate. The present findings may be directly applied to several important problems in plasma physics, including that of the chaos-induced destruction of magnetic surfaces in tokamaks.",Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems,"Adaptation and self-organizing systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that exhibit adaptive behavior and self-organization.

Giant Dipole Resonance Parameters of Ground-State Photoabsorption: Experimental Values with Uncertainties,van der Waals Interactions and Hadron Resonance Gas: Role of resonance widths modeling on conserved charges fluctuations,False,Updated values and corresponding uncertainties of Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) parameters which are obtained by the least-squares fitting of theoretical photoabsorption cross sections to experimental data are presented. The theoretical photoabsorption cross sections are taken as a sum of the components corresponding to the excitation of the GDR and quasideuteron photodisintegration. The current compilation is an extension and improvement of the earlier compilations of Lorentzian parameters for ground-state photoneutron and photoabsorption cross sections and covers experimental data made available up to June 2017.,"The quantum van der Waals (QvdW) extension of the ideal hadron resonance gas (HRG) model which includes the attractive and repulsive interactions between baryons -- the QvdW-HRG model -- is applied to study the behavior of the baryon number related susceptibilities in the crossover temperature region. Inclusion of the QvdW interactions leads to a qualitatively different behavior of susceptibilities, in many cases resembling lattice QCD simulations. It is shown that for some observables, in particular for $\chi_{11}^{BQ} / \chi_2^B$, effects of the QvdW interactions essentially cancel out. It is found that the inclusion of the finite resonance widths leads to an improved description of $\chi_2^B$, but it also leads to a worse description of $\chi_{11}^{BQ} / \chi_2^B$, as compared to the lattice data. On the other hand, inclusion of the extra, unconfirmed baryons into the hadron list leads to a simultaneous improvement in the description of both observables.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

HI signatures of galaxy evolution,Behaviour of oscillations in loop structures above active regions,False,"HI in and around galaxies provides unique information about the various processes shaping galaxies: merging, cold gas accretion, feedback. Observations of galaxies in the nearby universe are beginning to reveal the HI signatures of these processes by pushing the sensitivity limits of existing radio synthesis telescopes to their limits. This paper gives a brief inventory of these signatures. The capabilities of new instruments such as the SKA pathfinders and precursors is briefly addressed, though ultimately SKA will provide the adequate sensitivity to find these HI signatures beyond the local universe.","In this study we combine the multiwavelength ultraviolet -- optical (Solar Dynamics Observatory, SDO) and radio (Nobeyama Radioheliograph, NoRH) observations to get further insight into space-frequency distribution of oscillations at different atmospheric levels of the Sun. We processed the observational data on NOAA 11711 active region and found oscillations propagating from the photospheric level through the transition region upward into the corona. The power maps of low-frequency (1--2 mHz) oscillations reproduce well the fan-like coronal structures visible in the Fe ix 171A line. High frequency oscillations (5--7 mHz) propagate along the vertical magnetic field lines and concentrate inside small-scale elements in the umbra and at the umbra-penumbra boundary. We investigated the dependence of the dominant oscillation frequency upon the distance from the sunspot barycentre to estimate inclination of magnetic tubes in higher levels of sunspots where it cannot be measured directly, and found that this angle is close to 40 degrees above the umbra boundaries in the transition region.",Astrophysics of Galaxies,"Astrophysics of galaxies focuses on phenomena pertaining to galaxies or the Milky Way.

Integrable Boundary for Quad-Graph Systems: Three-Dimensional Boundary Consistency,Preferential Partner Selection in an Evolutionary Study of Prisoner's Dilemma,False,"We propose the notion of integrable boundary in the context of discrete integrable systems on quad-graphs. The equation characterizing the boundary must satisfy a compatibility equation with the one characterizing the bulk that we called the three-dimensional (3D) boundary consistency. In comparison to the usual 3D consistency condition which is linked to a cube, our 3D boundary consistency condition lives on a half of a rhombic dodecahedron. The We provide a list of integrable boundaries associated to each quad-graph equation of the classification obtained by Adler, Bobenko and Suris. Then, the use of the term ""integrable boundary"" is justified by the facts that there are B\""acklund transformations and a zero curvature representation for systems with boundary satisfying our condition. We discuss the three-leg form of boundary equations, obtain associated discrete Toda-type models with boundary and recover previous results as particular cases. Finally, the connection between the 3D boundary consistency and the set-theoretical reflection equation is established.","Partner selection is an important process in many social interactions, permitting individuals to decrease the risks associated with cooperation. In large populations, defectors may escape punishment by roving from partner to partner, but defectors in smaller populations risk social isolation. We investigate these possibilities for an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma in which agents use expected payoffs to choose and refuse partners. In comparison to random or round-robin partner matching, we find that the average payoffs attained with preferential partner selection tend to be more narrowly confined to a few isolated payoff regions. Most ecologies evolve to essentially full cooperative behavior, but when agents are intolerant of defections, or when the costs of refusal and social isolation are small, we also see the emergence of wallflower ecologies in which all agents are socially isolated. In between these two extremes, we see the emergence of ecologies whose agents tend to engage in a small number of defections followed by cooperation thereafter. The latter ecologies exhibit a plethora of interesting social interaction patterns.

Heavy Quark Physics on the Lattice,Tunneling Without Bounce,False,"I review the current status of lattice calculations of the properties of bound states containing one or more heavy quarks. Many of my remarks focus on the heavy-light leptonic decay constants, such as $f_B$, for which the systematic errors have by now been quite well studied. I also discuss $B$-parameters, semileptonic form factors, and the heavy-light and heavy-heavy spectra. Some of my ``world averages'' are: $f_B=200(30) MeV$, $f_B\sqrt{\hat B_{B_d}}= 230(40) MeV$, $f_{B_s}/f_B=1.16(4)$ and $f_{B_s}\sqrt{\hat B_{B_s}}/f_B\sqrt{\hat B_{B_d}}=1.16(5)$.","The false vacua of some potentials do not decay via Euclidean bounces. This typically happens for tunneling actions with a flat direction (in field configuration space) that is lifted by a perturbation into a sloping valley, pushing the bounce off to infinity. Using three different approaches we find a consistent picture for such decays. In the Euclidean approach the bottom of the action valley consists of a family of pseudo-bounces (field configurations with some key good properties of bounces except extremizing the action). The pseudo-bounce result is validated by minimizing a WKB action in Minkowski space along appropriate paths in configuration space.

Longitudinal and transverse meson correlators in the deconfined phase from the lattice,Amplitude analysis and branching fraction measurement of the decay $D_{s}^{+} \to \pi^{+}\pi^{0}\pi^{0}$,False,"It has long been known that QCD undergoes a deconfining phase transition at high temperature.

Evaluating links through spectral decomposition,SIR-HUXt -- a particle filter data assimilation scheme for assimilating CME time-elongation profiles,False,"Spectral decomposition has been rarely used to investigate complex networks. In this work we apply this concept in order to define two types of link-directed attacks while quantifying their respective effects on the topology. Several other types of more traditional attacks are also adopted and compared. These attacks had substantially diverse effects, depending on each specific network (models and real-world structures). It is also showed that the spectral-based attacks have special effect in affecting the transitivity of the networks.","We present the development of SIR-HUXt, the integration of a sequential importance resampling (SIR) data assimilation scheme with the HUXt solar wind model. SIR-HUXt is designed to assimilate the time-elongation profiles of CME fronts in the low heliosphere, such as those typically extracted from heliospheric imager data returned by the STEREO, Parker Solar Probe, and Solar Orbiter missions. We use Observing System Simulation Experiments to explore the performance of SIR-HUXt for a simple synthetic CME scenario of a fully Earth directed CME flowing through a uniform ambient solar wind, where the CME is initialised with the average observed CME speed and width. These experiments are performed for a range of observer locations, from 20 deg to 90 deg behind Earth, spanning the L5 point where ESA's future Vigil space weather monitor will return heliospheric imager data for operational space weather forecasting. We show that SIR-HUXt performs well at constraining the CME speed, and has some success at constraining the CME longitude. The CME width is largely unconstrained by the SIR-HUXt assimilations, and more experiments are required to determine if this is due to this specific CME scenario, or is a general feature of assimilating time-elongation profiles. Rank-histograms suggest that the SIR-HUXt ensembles are well calibrated, with no clear indications of bias or under/over dispersion. Improved constraints on the initial CME speed lead directly to improvements in the CME transit time to Earth and arrival speed. For an observer in the L5 region, SIR-HUXt returned a 69% reduction in the CME transit time uncertainty, and a 63% reduction in the arrival speed uncertainty. This suggests SIR-HUXt has potential to improve the real-world representivity of HUXt simulations, and therefore has potential to reduce the uncertainty of CME arrival time hindcasts and forecasts.",Physics and Society,"Physics and society focuses on structure, dynamics and collective behavior of societies and groups (human or otherwise).

Real-space detection and manipulation of topological edge modes with ultracold atoms,Fragile antiferromagnetism in the heavy-fermion compound YbBiPt,False,"Conventional topological insulators exhibit exotic gapless edge or surface states, as a result of non-trivial bulk topological properties. In periodically-driven systems the bulk-boundary correspondence is fundamentally modified and knowledge about conventional bulk topological invariants is insufficient. While ultracold atoms provide excellent settings for clean realizations of Floquet protocols, the observation of real-space edge modes has so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate an experimental protocol for realizing chiral edge modes in optical lattices, by creating a topological interface using a potential step that is generated with a programmable optical potential. We show how to efficiently prepare particles in these edge modes in three distinct Floquet topological regimes that are realized in a periodically-driven honeycomb lattice. Controlling the height and sharpness of the potential step, we study how edge modes emerge at the interface and how the group velocity of the particles is modified as the sharpness of the potential step is varied.","We report results from neutron scattering experiments on single crystals of YbBiPt that demonstrate antiferromagnetic order characterized by a propagation vector, $\tau_{\rm{AFM}}$ = ($\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{2}$), and ordered moments that align along the [1 1 1] direction of the cubic unit cell.

A Model for Energy Buildup and Eruption Onset in Coronal Mass Ejections,Modeling film flows down a fibre influenced by nozzle geometry,False,"Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and eruptive flares (EFs) are the most energetic explosions in the solar system. Their underlying origin is the free energy that builds up slowly in the sheared magnetic field of a filament channel. We report the first end-to-end numerical simulation of a CME/EF, from zero-free-energy initial state through filament-channel formation to violent eruption, driven solely by the magnetic-helicity condensation process. Helicity is the topological measure of linkages between magnetic flux systems, and is conserved in the corona, building up inexorably until it is ejected into interplanetary space. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that helicity injected by small-scale vortical motions, such as those observed in the photosphere, undergoes an inverse cascade from small scales to large, `condensing' at magnetic-polarity boundaries. Our new results verify that this process forms a filament channel within a compact bipolar region embedded in a background dipole field, and show for the first time that a fast CME eventually occurs via the magnetic-breakout mechanism. We further show that the trigger for explosive eruption is reconnection onset in the flare current sheet that develops above the polarity inversion line: this reconnection forms flare loops below the sheet and a CME flux rope above, and initiates high-speed outward flow of the CME. Our findings have important implications for magnetic self-organization and explosive behavior in solar and other astrophysical plasmas, and for understanding and predicting explosive solar activity.","We study the effects of nozzle geometry on the dynamics of thin fluid films flowing down a vertical cylindrical fibre. Recent experiments show that varying the nozzle diameter can lead to different flow regimes and droplet characteristics in the film.

Resonance in modulation instability from non-instantaneous nonlinearities,"Discrete Spinning Tops -- Difference equations for Euler, Lagrange, and Kowalevski tops",False,"To explore resonance phenomena in the nonlinear region, we show by experimental measurements and theoretical analyses that resonance happens in modulation instability (MI) from non-instantaneous nonlinearities in photorefractive crystals. With a temporally periodic modulation in the external bias voltage, corresponding to a modulation in the nonlinear strength, an enhancement in the visibility of MI at resonant frequency is reported through spontaneous optical pattern formations. Modeled by such temporally periodic nonlinear driving force to the system, theoretical curves obtained from a nonlinear non-instantaneous Schr\""{o}dinger equation give good agreement to experimental data. As MI is a universal signature of symmetry-breaking phenomena, our observation on the resonance in MI may provide a control on chaotic, solitary, and turbulence waves.","Several methods of time discretization are examined for integrable rigid body models, such as Euler, Lagrange, and Kowalevski tops. Problems of Lax-Moser pairs, conservation laws, and explicit solver algorithms are discussed.

Roton in a few-body dipolar system,Flows on Graphs with Random Capacities,False,"We solve numerically exactly the many-body 1D model of bosons interacting via short-range and dipolar forces and moving in the box with periodic boundary conditions. We show that the lowest energy states with fixed total momentum can be smoothly transformed from the typical states of collective character to states resembling single particle excitations. In particular, we identify the celebrated roton state. The smooth transition is realized by simultaneous tuning short-range interactions and adjusting a trap geometry. With our methods we study the weakly interacting regime as well as the regime beyond the range of validity of the Bogoliubov approximation.","We investigate flows on graphs whose links have random capacities. For binary trees we derive the probability distribution for the maximal flow from the root to a leaf, and show that for infinite trees it vanishes beyond a certain threshold that depends on the distribution of capacities. We then examine the maximal total flux from the root to the leaves.

In-medium Properties of Hadrons -- Observables,Bayesian calibration of viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic (VAH) simulations of heavy-ion collisions,False,"We first briefly review the theoretical basis for calculations of changes of hadronic properties in dense nuclear matter. These changes have usually been investigated by means of relativistic heavy-ion reactions. Here we discuss that observable consequences of such changes can also be seen in more elementary reactions on nuclei. Particular emphasis is put on a discussion of actual observables in photonuclear reactions; we discuss in detail $\eta$- and vector-meson production. We show that photoproduction of $\eta$'s can yield essential information on in-medium properties of the $S_{11}(1535)$ resonance while the $\phi$ meson properties will probably not be accessible through the $K^+K^-$ decay channel. However, for $\omega$ mesons the $\pi^0\gamma$ decay channel, due to its reduced final state interaction, looks more promising in this respect. Completely free of final state interactions is dilepton production in the few GeV range. We show that the sensitivity of this decay channel to changes of hadronic properties in medium in photonuclear reactions on nuclei is as large as in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Finally we discuss that hadron production in nuclei at 10 -- 20 GeV photon energies can give important information on the hadronization process.","A Bayesian calibration, using experimental data from 2.76 $A$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, of a novel hybrid model is presented in which the usual pre-hydrodynamic and viscous relativistic fluid dynamic (vRFD) stages are replaced by a viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic (VAH) core that smoothly interpolates between the initial expansion-dominated, approximately boost-invariant longitudinally free-streaming and the subsequent collision-dominated (3+1)-dimensional standard vRFD stages. This model yields meaningful constraints for the temperature-dependent specific shear and bulk viscosities, $(\eta/s)(T)$ and $(\zeta/s)(T)$, for temperatures up to about $700$ MeV (i.e. over twice the range that could be explored with earlier models). With its best-fit model parameters the calibrated VAH model makes highly successful predictions for additional $p_T$-dependent observables for which high-quality experimental data are available that were not used for the model calibration.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Complex Societies and the Growth of the Law,Phase transition of the energy flux in the near-inertial wave--mesoscale eddy coupled turbulence,False,"While a large number of informal factors influence how people interact, modern societies rely upon law as a primary mechanism to formally control human behaviour. How legal rules impact societal development depends on the interplay between two types of actors: the people who create the rules and the people to which the rules potentially apply. We hypothesise that an increasingly diverse and interconnected society might create increasingly diverse and interconnected rules, and assert that legal networks provide a useful lens through which to observe the interaction between law and society. To evaluate these propositions, we present a novel and generalizable model of statutory materials as multidimensional, time-evolving document networks. Applying this model to the federal legislation of the United States and Germany, we find impressive expansion in the size and complexity of laws over the past two and a half decades. We investigate the sources of this development using methods from network science and natural language processing. To allow for cross-country comparisons over time, we algorithmically reorganise the legislative materials of the United States and Germany into cluster families that reflect legal topics. This reorganisation reveals that the main driver behind the growth of the law in both jurisdictions is the expansion of the welfare state, backed by an expansion of the tax state.","Wind forcing injects energy into the mesoscale eddies and near-inertial waves (NIWs) in the ocean, and the NIW is believed to solve the puzzle of mesoscale energy budget by absorbing energy from mesoscale eddies followed by a forward cascade of NIW energy which finally dissipates at the ocean interior. This work studies the turbulent energy transfer in the NIW--quasigeostrophic mean mesoscale eddy coupled system based on a previously derived two-dimensional model which has a Hamiltonian structure and inherits conserved quantities in the Boussinesq equations (Xie \& Vanneste, \textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, vol. 774, 2015, pp. 147--169). Based on the conservation of energy, potential enstrophy and wave action, we propose a heuristic argument predicting the existence of phase transition with changing the relative strength between NIW and mean flow. By running forced-dissipative numerical simulations with varying parameter $R$, the ratio of the magnitude of NIW and mean-flow forcing, we justify the existence of phase transition, which is found to be second-order, around critical value $R_c$. When $0<R<R_c$, energy transfers bidirectionally, wave action transfers downscale, and vorticity form strong cyclones. While when $R>R_c$, energy transfers downscale, wave action transfers bidirectionally, and vortex filaments are dominant. We find the catalytic wave induction (CWI) mechanism where the NIW induces a downscale energy flux of the mean flow. The CWI mechanism differs from the stimulated loss of balance by the absence of energy conversion from the mesoscale eddy to NIW, and it is found to be effective in the toy-model study, making it potentially important for ocean energetics.",Physics and Society,"Physics and society focuses on structure, dynamics and collective behavior of societies and groups (human or otherwise).

Variability of eclipse timing:the case of V471 Tauri,Prospects for Galactic transient sources detection with the Cherenkov Telescope Array,False,"The post-common envelope binary V471 Tauri has been an object of interest for decades. V471 Tau shows various phenomena due to its evolutionary state and unique properties, e.g. its magnetic accretion and eclipse timing variation (ETV). Previous authors explained the ETVs by different, sometimes contradictory theories. In this paper, we present and analyse the variability of the eclipse timing of this star. We observed V471 Tauri over the last ten years and covered the second cycle of its period variation. Based on our analysis of the presented data, we assess the possible existence of a brown dwarf in this system and derive its orbital parameters. We compare the results of our dynamical modelling to the solution predicted by Applegate-mechanism theories, which have been developed in recent studies. We found that the observed ETV cannot be explained only by the presence of additional components to the binary.","Several types of Galactic sources, like magnetars, microquasars, novae or pulsar wind nebulae flares, display transient emission in the X-ray band. Some of these sources have also shown emission at MeV--GeV energies.

The task force investigates the prospects of detecting the VHE counterpart of such sources, as well as their study following Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations.

General synthetic iterative scheme for unsteady rarefied gas flows,Shape-tension coupling produces nematic order in an epithelium vertex model,False,"In rarefied gas flows, the spatial grid size could vary by several orders of magnitude in a single flow configuration (e.g., inside the Knudsen layer it is at the order of mean free path of gas molecules, while in the bulk region it is at a much larger hydrodynamic scale). Therefore, efficient implicit numerical method is urgently needed for time-dependent problems. However, the integro-differential nature of gas kinetic equations poses a grand challenge, as the gain part of the collision operator is non-invertible. Hence an iterative solver is required in each time step, which usually takes a lot of iterations in the (near) continuum flow regime where the Knudsen number is small; worse still, the solution does not asymptotically preserve the fluid dynamic limit when the spatial cell size is not refined enough. Inspired by our general synthetic iteration scheme for steady-state solution of the Boltzmann equation, we propose two numerical schemes to push the multiscale simulation of unsteady rarefied gas flows to a new boundary, that is, the numerical solution not only converges within dozens of iterations in each time step, but also asymptotic preserves the Navier-Stokes-Fourier limit at coarse spatial grid, even when the time step is large (e.g., in the extreme slow decay of two-dimensional Taylor vortex, the time step is at the order of vortex decay time). The properties of fast convergence and asymptotic preserving of the proposed schemes are not only rigorously proven by the Fourier stability analysis, but also demonstrated by solid numerical examples.","We study the vertex model for epithelial tissue mechanics extended to include coupling between the cell shapes and tensions in cell-cell junctions. This coupling represents an active force which drives the system out of equilibrium and leads to the formation of nematic order interspersed with prominent, long-lived $+1$ defects. The defects in the nematic ordering are coupled to the shape of the cell tiling, affecting cell areas and coordinations. This intricate interplay between cell shape, size, and coordination provides a possible mechanism by which tissues could spontaneously develop long-range polarity through local mechanical forces without resorting to long-range chemical patterning.",Fluid Dynamics,"Fluid dynamics in physics focuses on turbulence, instabilities, incompressible/compressible flows, reacting flows.

New nuclear structure features in transactinide nuclei,Is the LHCb $P_c(4312)^+$ plausible in the GlueX $\gamma p\to J/\psi p$ total cross sections ?,False,"The structural evolution of the heavy nuclei, with Z > 82, is investigated by looking at the differential variation of the two-neutron separation energies. It indicates, by non-monotonous behavior at certain neutron numbers, structure phenomena such as major shell (N = 126) and deformed subshell (N = 152) closures. Another interesting effect is observed at N ~ 142, which is very well correlated with a previously observed, intriguing behavior of quantities measured in alpha decay, such as relative branching ratios and hindrance factors of excited states from the ground state band of deformed nuclei in this region. Corroboration of the existing experimental data indicates another possible deformed subshell closure.","New high-statistics total cross section data for $\gamma p\to J/\psi p$ from the GLUonic EXcitation (GlueX) experiment are fitted in a search for the exotic $P_c(4312)^+$ state observed by the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) collaboration. The integrated luminosity of this GlueX experiment was about $320~\mathrm{pb^{-1}}$.

Lower-Critical Spin-Glass Dimension from 23 Sequenced Hierarchical Models,Theory of shift heat current and its application to electron-phonon coupled systems,False,"The lower-critical dimension for the existence of the Ising spin-glass phase is calculated, numerically exactly, as $d_L = 2.520$ for a family of hierarchical lattices, from an essentially exact (correlation coefficent $R^2 = 0.999999$) near-linear fit to 23 different diminishing fractional dimensions. To obtain this result, the phase transition temperature between the disordered and spin-glass phases, the corresponding critical exponent $y_T$, and the runaway exponent $y_R$ of the spin-glass phase are calculated for consecutive hierarchical lattices as dimension is lowered.","We propose a heat current analog of the shift current, ""shift heat current"". We study nonlinear heat current responses to an applied ac electric field by a diagrammatic method and derive a microscopic expression for the second order dc heat current response. As a result, we find that the shift heat current is related to the shift vector, a geometric quantity that also appears in the expression for the shift current. The shift heat current directly depends on and can be controlled through the chemical potential. In addition, we apply the diagrammatic method to electron-phonon coupled systems, and we find that even if only the phonons are excited by an external field, the amplitude of the shift heat current is determined by the energy scale of electrons, not of phonons.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

African Dust Influence on Atlantic Hurricane Activity and the Peculiar Behaviour of Category 5 Hurricanes,Modeling Short-Range and Three-Membered Ring Structures in Lithium Borosilicate Glasses using Machine Learning Potential,False,"We study the specific influence of African dust on each one of the categories of Atlantic hurricanes. By applying wavelet analysis, we find a strong decadal modulation of African dust on Category 5 hurricanes and an annual modulation on all other categories of hurricanes. We identify the formation of Category 5 hurricanes occurring mainly around the decadal minimum variation of African dust and in deep water areas of the Atlantic Ocean, where hurricane eyes have the lowest pressure. According to our results, future tropical cyclones will not evolve to Category 5 until the next decadal minimum that is, by the year 2015 +/- 2.","Lithium borosilicate (LBS) glass is a prototypical lithium-ion conducting oxide glasses available for an all-solid state buttery. Nevertheless, the atomistic modeling of LBS glass using $ab$ $initio$ (AIMD) and classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations have critical limitations due to computational cost and inaccuracy in reproducing the glass microstructures, respectively. To overcome these difficulties, a machine-learning potential (MLP) was examined in this work for modeling LBS glasses using DeepMD. The glass structures obtained by this MLP possessed fourhold-coordinated boron ($^4$B) confirmed well with the experimental data and abundance of three-membered rings. The models were energetically more stable compared with those constructed with a functional force-field even though both the models included reasonable $^4$B.

Induced superconductivity in high mobility two dimensional electron gas in GaAs heterostructures,Cotunnite-structured titanium dioxide: the hardest known oxide,False,"Introduction of a Josephson field effect transistor (JoFET) concept sparked active research on proximity effects in semiconductors. Induced superconductivity and electrostatic control of critical current has been demonstrated in two-dimensional gases in InAs, graphene and topological insulators, and in one-dimensional systems including quantum spin Hall edges. Recently, interest in superconductor-semiconductor interfaces was renewed by the search for Majorana fermions, which were predicted to reside at the interface. More exotic non-Abelian excitations, such as parafermions (fractional Majorana fermions) or Fibonacci fermions may be formed when fractional quantum Hall edge states interface with superconductivity. In this paper we develop transparent superconducting contacts to high mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in GaAs and demonstrate induced superconductivity across several microns. Supercurrent in a ballistic junction has been observed across 0.6 $\mu$m of 2DEG, a regime previously achieved only in point contacts but essential to the formation of well separated non-Abelian states. High critical fields ($>16$ Tesla) in NbN contacts enables investigation of a long-sought regime of an interplay between superconductivity and strongly correlated states in a 2DEG at high magnetic fields.","Despite great technological importance and many investigations, a material with measured hardness comparable to that of diamond or cubic boron nitride has yet to be identified. Combined theoretical and experimental investigations led to the discovery of a new polymorph of titanium dioxide with titanium nine-coordinated to oxygen in the cotunnite (PbCl2) structure. Hardness measurements on the cotunnite-structured TiO2 synthesized at pressures above 60 GPa and temperatures above 1000 K reveal that this material is the hardest oxide yet discovered.

Chimera Ising Walls in Forced Nonlocally Coupled Oscillators,Non-Perturbative Zero Modes in the Kraichnan Model for Turbulent Advection,False,"Nonlocally coupled oscillator systems can exhibit an exotic spatiotemporal structure called chimera, where the system splits into two groups of oscillators with sharp boundaries, one of which is phase-locked and the other is phase-randomized. Two examples of the chimera states are known: the first one appears in a ring of phase oscillators, and the second one is associated with the two-dimensional rotating spiral waves.

Measured proton electromagnetic structure deviates from theoretical predictions,Systematic study of $\mathcal{\alpha}$ decay half-lives based on Gamow--like model with a screened electrostatic barrier,False,"The visible world is founded on the proton, the only composite building block of matter that is stable in nature. Consequently, understanding the formation of matter relies on explaining the dynamics and the properties of the proton's bound state.A fundamental property of the proton involves the response of the system to an external electromagnetic field. It is characterized by the electromagnetic polarizabilities that describe how easily the charge and magnetization distributions inside the system are distorted by the electromagnetic field. Moreover, the generalized polarizabilities map out the resulting deformation of the densities in a proton subject to an electromagnetic field. They disclose essential information about the underlying system dynamics and provide a key for decoding the proton structure in terms of the theory of the strong interaction that binds its elementary quark and gluon constituents. Of particular interest is a puzzle in the electric generalized polarizability of the proton that remains unresolved for two decades. Here we report measurements of the proton's electromagnetic generalized polarizabilities at low four-momentum transfer squared. We show evidence of an anomaly to the behaviour of the proton's electric generalized polarizability that contradicts the predictions of nuclear theory and derive its signature in the spatial distribution of the induced polarization in the proton. The reported measurements suggest the presence of a new, not-yet-understood dynamical mechanism in the proton and present notable challenges to the nuclear theory.","In the present work we systematically study $\mathcal{\alpha}$ decay half-lives of $Z>51$ nuclei using the modified Gamow-like model which includes the effects of the centrifugal potential and electrostatic shielding. For the case of even-even nuclei, this model contains two adjustable parameters: the parameter $a$ related to the screened electrostatic barrier and the radius constant $r_0$, while for the case of odd-odd and odd-A nuclei, it is added a new parameter i.e. hindrance factor $h$ which is used to describe the effect of an odd-proton and/or an odd-neutron. Our calculations can well reproduce the experimental data.

"Star clusters in M33: updated UBVRI photometry, ages, metallicities, and masses",X-ray Substructure Studies of Four Galaxy Clusters using XMM-Newton Data,False,"The photometric characterization of M33 star clusters is far from complete. In this paper, we present homogeneous $UBVRI$ photometry of 708 star clusters and cluster candidates in M33 based on archival images from the Local Group Galaxies Survey, which covers 0.8 deg$^2$ along the galaxy's major axis. Our photometry includes 387, 563, 616, 580, and 478 objects in the $UBVRI$ bands, respectively, of which 276, 405, 430, 457, and 363 do not have previously published $UBVRI$ photometry. Our photometry is consistent with previous measurements (where available) in all filters. We adopted Sloan Digital Sky Survey $ugriz$ photometry for complementary purposes, as well as Two Micron All-Sky Survey near-infrared $JHK$ photometry where available. We fitted the spectral-energy distributions of 671 star clusters and candidates to derive their ages, metallicities, and masses based on the updated {\sc parsec} simple stellar populations synthesis models. The results of our $\chi^2$ minimization routines show that only 205 of the 671 clusters ($31\%$) are older than 2 Gyr, which represents a much smaller fraction of the cluster population than that in M31 ($56\%$), suggesting that M33 is dominated by young star clusters ($<1$ Gyr). We investigate the mass distributions of the star clusters---both open and globular clusters---in M33, M31, the Milky Way, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Their mean values are $\log(M_{\rm cl}/M_{\odot})=4.25$, 5.43, 2.72, and 4.18, respectively. The fraction of open to globular clusters is highest in the Milky Way and lowest in M31. Our comparisons of the cluster ages, masses, and metallicities show that our results are basically in agreement with previous studies (where objects in common are available); differences can be traced back to differences in the models adopted, the fitting methods used, and stochastic sampling effects.","Mahdavi et al. find that the degree of agreement between weak lensing and X-ray mass measurements is a function of cluster radius. Numerical simulations also point out that X-ray mass proxies do not work equally well at all radii. The origin of the effect is thought to be associated with cluster mergers. Recent work presenting the cluster maps showed an ability of X-ray maps to reveal and study cluster mergers in detail. Here we present a first attempt to use the study of substructure in assessing the systematics of the hydrostatic mass measurements using two-dimensional (2-D) X-ray diagnostics. The temperature map is uniquely able to identify the substructure in an almost relaxed cluster which would be unnoticed in the ICM electron number density and pressure maps. We describe the radial fluctuations in the 2-D maps by a cumulative/differential scatter profile relative to the mean profile within/at a given radius. The amplitude indicates ~10 fluctuations in the temperature, electron number density and entropy maps, and ~15 fluctuations in the pressure map. The amplitude of and the discontinuity in the scatter complement 2-D substructure diagnostics, e.g. indicating the most disturbed radial range. There is a tantalizing link between the substructure identified using the scatter of the entropy and pressure fluctuations and the hydrostatic mass bias relative to the expected mass based on the M-Yx and M-Mgas relations particularly at r500.

Dual conformal invariance in the Regge limit,Coexistence of CP eigenstates in Higgs boson decay,False,"A dual conformal symmetry, analogous to the dual conformal symmetry observed for the scattering amplitudes of N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory, is identified in the Regge limit of QCD. Combined with the original two-dimensional conformal symmetry of the theory, this dual symmetry can potentially explain the integrability of the BFKL Hamiltonian. We also give evidence that the symmetry survives when a subset of unitarity corrections are taken into account by studying briefly the non-planar 2 to m reggeon transition vertices.","The supersymmetric extension of the standard model contains an intrinsic sourceof CP violation mediated by the charginos.

Taming Instabilities in Power Grid Networks by Decentralized Control,"Affine Lie group approach to a derivative nonlinear Schr\""odinger equatoin and its similarity reduction",False,"Renewables will soon dominate energy production in our electric power system. And yet, how to integrate renewable energy into the grid and the market is still a subject of major debate. Decentral Smart Grid Control (DSGC) was recently proposed as a robust and decentralized approach to balance supply and demand and to guarantee a grid operation that is both economically and dynamically feasible. Here, we analyze the impact of network topology by assessing the stability of essential network motifs using both linear stability analysis and basin volume for delay systems. Our results indicate that if frequency measurements are averaged over sufficiently large time intervals, DSGC enhances the stability of extended power grid systems. We further investigate whether DSGC supports centralized and/or decentralized power production and find it to be applicable to both. However, our results on cycle-like systems suggest that DSGC favors systems with decentralized production. Here, lower line capacities and lower averaging times are required compared to those with centralized production.","The generalized Drinfel'd-Sokolov hierarchies studied by de Groot-Hollowood-Miramontes are extended from the viewpoint of Sato-Wilson dressing method.

Supermassive black hole spin evolution in cosmological simulations with OpenGadget3,Supernova Neutrino Detection in LZ,False,"Mass and spin of massive black holes (BHs) at the centre of galaxies evolve due to gas accretion and mergers with other BHs. Besides affecting e.g. the evolution of relativistic jets, the BH spin determines the efficiency with which the BH radiates energy. Using cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the evolution of the BH spin across cosmic time and its role in controlling the joint growth of supermassive BHs and their host galaxies. We implement a sub-resolution prescription that models the BH spin, accounting for both BH coalescence and misaligned accretion through a geometrically thin, optically thick disc. We investigate how BH spin evolves in two idealised setups, in zoomed-in simulations, and in a cosmological volume. The latter simulation allows us to retrieve statistically robust results as for the evolution and distribution of BH spins as a function of BH properties. We find that BHs with $M_{\rm BH}\lesssim 2 \times 10^{7}\;{\rm M}_{\odot}$ grow through gas accretion, occurring mostly in a coherent fashion that favours spin-up. Above $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 2 \times 10^{7}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ the gas angular momentum directions of subsequent accretion episodes are often uncorrelated with each other. The probability of counter-rotating accretion and hence spin-down increases with BH mass. In the latter mass regime, BH coalescence plays an important role. The spin magnitude displays a wide variety of histories, depending on the dynamical state of the gas feeding the BH and the relative contribution of mergers and gas accretion. As a result of their combined effect, we observe a broad range of values of the spin magnitude at the high-mass end. Our predictions for the distributions of BH spin and spin-dependent radiative efficiency as a function of BH mass are in very good agreement with observations.","In the first 10 seconds of a core-collapse supernova, almost all of its progenitor's gravitational potential, O(10$^{53}$~ergs), is carried away in the form of neutrinos. These neutrinos, with O(10~MeV) kinetic energy, can interact via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) depositing O(1~keV) in detectors. In this work, we demonstrate that low-background dark matter detectors, such as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), optimized for detecting low-energy depositions, are capable of detecting these neutrino interactions. For instance, a 27~M$_\odot$ supernova at 10~kpc is expected to produce $\sim$350 neutrino interactions in the 7-tonne liquid xenon active volume of LZ. Based on the LS220 EoS neutrino flux model for a SN, the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST), and predicted CE$\nu$NS cross-sections for xenon, to study energy deposition and detection of SN neutrinos in LZ.

Clusters and higher moments of proton number fluctuations,Nuclear collisions at the Future Circular Collider,False,"Production of deuterons by coalescence has an important influence on the moments of the observed proton number distribution. Therefore, this effect must be taken into account when physics conclusions about baryon number fluctuation are drawn from the measurement of proton number fluctuations. We also show that a measurement of the third and fourth moments of the deuteron number distribution would allow to distinguish whether deuterons are produced statistically or by coalescence.","The Future Circular Collider is a new proposed collider at CERN with centre-of-mass energies around 100 TeV in the pp mode.

On the relationship of coastal tropical rainfall and the large-scale atmosphere,"Foundry manufacturing of tight-confinement, dispersion-engineered, ultralow-loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuit",False,"Rainfall in coastal areas of the tropics is often shaped by the presence of circulations directly associated with the topography, such as land-sea and/or mountain-valley breezes. In many regions the coastally-affected rainfall consitutes more than half of the overall rainfall received. Weather and climate models with parametrized convection produce large errors in rainfall in tropical coastal regions, most commonly underestimating rainfall over land and overestimating it over the ocean. Building on an algorithm to objectively identify rainfall that is associated with land-sea interaction we investigate whether the relationship between rainfall in coastal regions and the large-scale atmosphere differs from that over the open ocean or over inland areas. We combine 3-hourly satellite estimates of rainfall with estimates of the large-scale atmospheric state from reanalyses. We find that when grouped by rainfall intensity, medium-intensity coastal rainfall in the tropics occurs in more stable conditions and drier atmospheres and is associated with less large-scale convergence than its open-ocean and inland counterparts. Overall, the dependence of the amount of rainfall on the large-scale state is significantly weaker when the rainfall is coastally influenced. Our findings indicate that the representation of convection in weather and climate models must cater for the special character of the large-to-small scale relationship near coasts rather than rely on a common set of rules across the globe.","The foundry development of integrated photonics has revolutionized today's optical interconnect and datacenters. Over the last decade, we have witnessed the rising of silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) integrated photonics, which is currently transferring from laboratory research to foundry manufacturing. The development and transition are triggered by the ultimate need of low optical loss offered by Si$_3$N$_4$, which is beyond the reach of silicon and III-V semiconductors. Combined with modest Kerr nonlinearity, tight optical confinement and dispersion engineering, Si$_3$N$_4$ has today become the leading platform for linear and Kerr nonlinear photonics, and has enabled chip-scale lasers featuring ultralow noise on par with table-top fiber lasers. However, so far all the reported fabrication processes of tight-confinement, dispersion-engineered Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic integrated circuit (PIC) with optical loss down to few dB/m have only been developed on 4-inch or smaller wafers. Yet, to transfer these processes to established CMOS foundries that typically operate 6-inch or even larger wafers, challenges remain. In this work, we demonstrate the first foundry-standard fabrication process of Si$_3$N$_4$ PIC with only 2.6 dB/m loss, thickness above 800 nm, and near 100% fabrication yield on 6-inch wafers. Such thick and ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ PIC enables low-threshold generation of soliton frequency combs. Merging with advanced heterogeneous integration, active ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ integrated photonics could pave an avenue to addressing future demands in our increasingly information-driven society.",Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics,"Atmospheric and oceanic physics focuses on the physical processes occurring in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

Spectroscopic visualization of flat bands in magic-angle twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene: localization-delocalization coexisting electronic states,Realization of a single Josephson junction for Bose-Einstein condensates,False,"Recent transport studies have demonstrated the great potential of twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a new platform to host moir\'e flat bands with a higher tunability than twisted bilayer graphene (tBG). However, a direct visualization of the flat bands in tMBG and its comparison with the ones in tBG remain unexplored. Here, via fabricating on a single sample with exactly the same twist angle of ~1.13{\deg}, we present a direct comparative study between tMBG and tBG using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. We observe a sharp density of states peak near the Fermi energy in tunneling spectroscopy, confirming unambiguously the existence of flat electronic bands in tMBG. The bandwidth of this flat-band peak is found to be slightly narrower than that of the tBG, validating previous theoretical predictions. Remarkably, by measuring spatially resolved spectroscopy, combined with continuum model calculation, we show that the flat-band states in tMBG exhibit a unique layer-resolved localization-delocalization coexisting feature, which offers an unprecedented possibility to utilize their cooperation on exploring novel correlation phenomena. Our work provides important microscopic insight of flat-band states for better understanding the emergent physics in graphene moir\'e systems.",We report on the realization of a double-well potential for Rubidium-87 Bose-Einstein condensates.

Medium Dependence of the Vector-Meson Mass: Dynamical and/or Brown-Rho Scaling?,Resonance-like coherent production of a pion pair in the reaction $pd \rightarrow pd\pi\pi$ in the GeV region,False,"We discuss the similarities and differences for the theories of Rapp, Wambach and collaborators (called R/W in short) and those based on Brown-Rho scaling (called B/R), as applied to reproduce the dileptons measured by the CERES collaboration in the CERN experiments. In both theories the large number of dileptons at invariant masses $\sim$~$m_\rho/2$ are shown to be chiefly produced by a density-dependent $\rho$-meson mass. In R/W the medium dependence is dynamically calculated using hadronic variables defined in the matter-free vacuum. In B/R scaling it follows from movement towards chiral symmetry restoration due to medium-induced vacuum change, and is described in terms of constituent (or quasiparticle) quarks. We argue that the R/W description should be reliable up to densities somewhat beyond nuclear density, where hadrons are the effective variables. At higher density there should be a crossover to constituent quarks as effective variables scaling according to B/R. In the crossover region, the two descriptions must be ``dual''.","The reaction $p + d \rightarrow p + d + X$ was studied at 0.8-2.0 GeV proton beam energies with the ANKE magnetic spectrometer at the COSY synchrotron storage ring. The proton-deuteron pairs emerging with high momenta, 0.6-1.8 GeV/$c$, were detected at small angles with respect to the proton beam. Distribution over the reaction missing mass $M_x$ reveals a local enhancement near the threshold of the pion pair production specific for the so-called ABC effect. The enhancement has a structure of a narrow bump placed above a smooth continuum. The invariant mass of the $d\pi\pi$ system in this enhancement region exhibits a resonance-like peak at $M_{d\pi\pi} \approx 2.36$ GeV/$c^2$ with the width $\Gamma \approx 0.10$ GeV/$c^2$.

A Large-Diameter Hollow-Shaft Cryogenic Motor Based on a Superconducting Magnetic Bearing for Millimeter-Wave Polarimetry,Quaoar: A Rock in the Kuiper belt,False,"In this paper we present the design and measured performance of a novel cryogenic motor based on a superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB). The motor is tailored for use in millimeter-wave half-wave plate (HWP) polarimeters, where a HWP is rapidly rotated in front of a polarization analyzer or polarization-sensitive detector. This polarimetry technique is commonly used in cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization studies. The SMB we use is composed of fourteen yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) disks and a contiguous neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) ring magnet. The motor is a hollow-shaft motor because the HWP is ultimately installed in the rotor. The motor presented here has a 100 mm diameter rotor aperture. However, the design can be scaled up to rotor aperture diameters of approximately 500 mm. Our motor system is composed of four primary subsystems: (i) the rotor assembly, which includes the NdFeB ring magnet, (ii) the stator assembly, which includes the YBCO disks, (iii) an incremental encoder, and (iv) the drive electronics. While the YBCO is cooling through its superconducting transition, the rotor is held above the stator by a novel hold and release mechanism (HRM). The encoder subsystem consists of a custom-built encoder disk read out by two fiber optic readout sensors. For the demonstration described in this paper, we ran the motor at 50 K and tested rotation frequencies up to approximately 10 Hz. The feedback system was able to stabilize the the rotation speed to approximately 0.4%, and the measured rotor orientation angle uncertainty is less than 0.15 deg. Lower temperature operation will require additional development activities, which we will discuss.","Here we report WFPC2 observations of the Quaoar-Weywot Kuiper belt binary.

The orbit reveals a surpsingly high Quaoar-Weywot system mass of 1.6{\pm}0.3{\times}10^21 kg. Using the surface properties of the Uranian and Neptunian satellites as a proxy for Quaoar's surface, we reanalyze the size estimate from Brown and Trujillo (2004). We find, from a mean of available published size estimates, a diameter for Quaoar of 890 {\pm} 70 km.

Signal Improvement and Contrast Enhancement in Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Magnetic nanodrug delivery in non-Newtonian blood flows,False,"This thesis reports advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with the ultimate goal of improving signal and contrast in biomedical applications. More specifically, novel MRI pulse sequences have been designed to characterize microstructure, enhance signal and contrast in tissue, and image functional processes. In this thesis, rat brain and red bone marrow images are acquired using iMQCs (intermolecular multiple quantum coherences) between intermediate separated spins. As an important application, iMQCs images in different directions can be used for anisotropy mapping and tissue microstructure analysis. At the same time, the simulations prove that the dipolar field from the overall shape only has small contributions to the experimental iMQC signal. Besides magnitude of iMQCs, phase of iMQCs should be studied as well. The phase anisotropy maps built by our method can clearly show susceptibility information in rat brain. It may provide meaningful diagnostic information. To deeply study susceptibility, the modified-crazed sequence is developed. Combining phase data of modified-crazed images and phase data of iMQCs images is very promising to construct microstructure maps. Obviously, the phase image in all above techniques needs to be highly-contrasted and clear. To achieve the goal, algorithm tools from Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging (SWI) and Susceptibility Tensor Imaging (STI) stands out superb useful and creative in our system.","With the goal of determining strategies to maximise drug delivery to a specific site in the body, we developed a mathematical model for the transport of drug nanocarriers (nanoparticles) in the bloodstream under the influence of an external magnetic field. Under the assumption of long (compared to the radius) blood vessels the Navier-Stokes equations are reduced, to a simpler model consistently with lubrication theory. Under these assumptions, analytical results are compared for Newtonian, power-law, Carreau and Ellis fluids, and these clearly demonstrate the importance of shear thinning effects when modelling blood flow. Incorporating nanoparticles and a magnetic field to the model we develop a numerical scheme and study the particle motion for different field strengths. We demonstrate the importance of the non-Newtonian behaviour: for the flow regimes investigated in this work, consistent with those in blood micro vessels, we find that the field strength needed to absorb a certain amount of particles in a non-Newtonian fluid has to be larger than the one needed in a Newtonian fluid. Specifically, for one case examined, a two times larger magnetic force had to be applied in the Ellis fluid than in the Newtonian fluid for the same number of particles to be absorbed through the vessel wall. Consequently, models based on a Newtonian fluid can drastically overestimate the effect of a magnetic field. Finally, we evaluate the particle concentration at the vessel wall and compute the evolution of the particle flux through the wall for different permeability values, as that is important when assessing the efficacy of drug delivery applications. The insights from our work bring us a step closer to successfully transferring magnetic nanoparticle drug delivery to the clinic.",Medical Physics,"Medical physics focuses on radiation therapy.

Subhaloes gone Notts: Subhaloes as tracers of the dark matter halo shape,Spatially Offset Active Galactic Nuclei III: Discovery of Late-Stage Galaxy Mergers with The Hubble Space Telescope,False,"We study the shapes of subhalo distributions from four dark-matter-only simulations of Milky Way type haloes. Comparing the shapes derived from the subhalo distributions at high resolution to those of the underlying dark matter fields we find the former to be more triaxial if theanalysis is restricted to massive subhaloes. For three of the four analysed haloes the increased triaxiality of the distributions of massive subhaloes can be explained by a systematic effect caused by the low number of objects. Subhaloes of the fourth halo show indications for anisotropic accretion via their strong triaxial distribution and orbit alignment with respect to the dark matter field. These results are independent of the employed subhalo finder. Comparing the shape of the observed Milky Way satellite distribution to those of high-resolution subhalo samples from simulations, we find an agreement for samples of bright satellites, but significant deviations if faint satellites are included in the analysis. These deviations might result from observational incompleteness.","Galaxy pairs with separations of only a few kpc represent important stages in the merger-driven growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, such mergers are difficult to identify observationally due to the correspondingly small angular scales. In Paper I we presented a method of finding candidate kpc-scale galaxy mergers that is leveraged on the selection of X-ray sources spatially offset from the centers of host galaxies. In this paper we analyze new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 imaging for six of these sources to search for signatures of galaxy mergers. The HST imaging reveals that four of the six systems are on-going galaxy mergers with separations of 1.2-6.6 kpc (offset AGN). The nature of the remaining two spatially offset X-ray sources is ambiguous and may be associated with super-Eddington accretion in X-ray binaries. The ability of this sample to probe small galaxy separations and minor mergers makes it uniquely suited for testing the role of galaxy mergers for AGN triggering. We find that galaxy mergers with only one AGN are predominantly minor mergers with mass ratios similar to the overall population of galaxy mergers. By comparison, galaxy mergers with two AGN are biased toward major mergers and larger nuclear gas masses. Finally, we find that the level of SMBH accretion increases toward smaller mass ratios (major mergers). This result suggests the mass ratio effects not only the frequency of AGN triggering but also the rate of SMBH growth in mergers.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Interplay of inertia and deformability on rheological properties of a suspension of capsules,"Anderson Transition and Generalized Lyapunov Exponents (comment on comment by P.Markos, L.Schweitzer and M.Weyrauch, cond-mat/0402068)",False,"The interplay of inertia and deformability has a substantial impact on the transport of soft particles suspended in a fluid. However, to date a thorough understanding of these systems is still missing and only a limited number of experimental and theoretical studies is available. We combine the finite-element, immersed-boundary and lattice-Boltzmann methods to simulate three-dimensional suspensions of soft particles subjected to planar Poiseuille flow at finite Reynolds numbers. Our findings confirm that the particle deformation and inclination increase when inertia is present. We observe that the Segr\'e-Silberberg effect is suppressed with respect to the particle deformability. Depending on the deformability and strength of inertial effects, inward or outward lateral migration of the particles takes place. In particular, for increasing Reynolds numbers and strongly deformable particles, a hitherto unreported distinct flow focusing effect emerges which is accompanied by a non-monotonic behaviour of the apparent suspension viscosity and thickness of the particle-free layer close to the channel walls. This effect can be explained by the behaviour of a single particle and the change of the particle collision mechanism when both deformability and inertia effects are relevant.","The generalized Lyapunov exponents describe the growth of the second moments for a particular solution of the quasi-1D Schroedinger equation with initial conditions on the left end. Their possible application in the Anderson transition theory became recently a subject for controversy in the literature.

Active control of transport through nanopores,Quantum oscillations and upper critical magnetic field of the iron-based superconductor FeSe,False,"Passive particle transport through narrow channels is well studied, while for active particle systems, it is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate the active control of the transport through a nanopore via mean-field analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. We prove that the active force enhances the transport efficiency with an effective diffusion coefficient $D_{eff} = D_t (1 + Pe^2/6)$, where $D_t$ is the translational diffusion coefficient, and $Pe$ is the P\'{e}clet number that determines the strength of the active force. For the number of particles inside the channel, it experiences subdiffusion at short times and then turns to normal at longer times. Finally, we extend our research for several sinusoidal shapes of the channel surface. More particles are trapped in the channel if the roughness of the channel surface is increased, resulting in fewer particles are transported from one side of the channel to the other.","Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and upper critical magnetic field ($H\_{c2}$) of the iron-based superconductor FeSe ($T\_c$ = 8.6 K) have been studied by tunnel diode oscillator-based measurements in magnetic fields of up to 55 T and temperatures down to 1.6 K. Several Fourier components enter the SdH oscillations spectrum with frequencies definitely smaller than predicted by band structure calculations indicating band renormalization and reconstruction of the Fermi surface at low temperature, in line with previous ARPES data. The Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model accounts for the temperature dependence of $H\_{c2}$ for magnetic field applied both parallel (\textbf{H} $\|$ $ab$) and perpendicular (\textbf{H} $\|$ $c$) to the iron conducting plane, suggesting that one band mainly controls the superconducting properties in magnetic fields despite the multiband nature of the Fermi surface. Whereas Pauli pair breaking is negligible for \textbf{H} $\|$ $c$, a Pauli paramagnetic contribution is evidenced for \textbf{H} $\|$ $ab$ with Maki parameter $\alpha$ = 2.1, corresponding to Pauli field $H\_{P}$ = 36.5 T",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Origin of the springs of Costa Verde beach in Lima Peru,High-resolution ARPES endstation for in-situ electronic structure investigations at SSRF,False,"This paper tries to determine the origin of springs on the Costa Verde beach, located in the district of Barranco, Miraflores and Magdalena, province of Lima, Peru. These springs emerge near the shoreline, from the lower layers of a 80 meter high cliff. They have survived the process of urbanization of agricultural land, started in the early 70, which decreased the water table aquifer of Lima, and wiped the water leaks from the cliffs. To identify the source of the springs, isotopic, physical, chemical and bacteriological analysis was carried out for samples from five springs. The isotopic concentrations in waters from Costa Verde springs are depleted compared to those obtained for Lima aquifer waters, which is recharged by infiltration of the Rimac River. The measured values of those concentrations suggest that water from the Costa Verde springs should come from a direct recharge in the upper and middle basin, due to infiltration of rainfall or the river at an altitude of about 3600 m. Conductivity and temperature, measured in situ, are similar to those obtained on Lima aquifers. The laboratory analysis showed no significant levels of total or fecal coliform, discarding possible leakage from Lima sewerage.","Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is one of the most powerful experimental techniques in condensed matter physics. Synchrotron ARPES, which uses photons with high flux and continuously tunable energy, has become particularly important.

In addition, the ARPES system of this endstation is equipped with a six-axis cryogenic sample manipulator (the lowest temperature is 7 K) and is integrated with an oxide molecular beam epitaxy system and a scanning tunneling microscope, which can provide an advanced platform for in-situ characterization of the fine electronic structure of condensed matter.",Geophysics,Geophysics focuses on atmospheric physics.

Generalization of the $\epsilon$-BBS and the Schensted insertion algorithm,Vibrational and stochastic resonances in two coupled overdamped anharmonic oscillators,False,"The $\epsilon$-BBS is the family of solitonic cellular automata obtained via the ultradiscretization of the elementary Toda orbits, which is a parametrized family of integrable systems unifying the Toda equation and the relativistic Toda equation. In this paper, we derive the $\epsilon$-BBS with many kinds of balls and give its conserved quantities by the Schensted insertion algorithm which is introduced in combinatorics. To prove this, we extend birational transformations of the continuous elementary Toda orbits to the discrete hungry elementary Toda orbits.","We study the overdamped version of two coupled anharmonic oscillators under the influence of both low- and high-frequency forces respectively and a Gaussian noise term added to one of the two state variables of the system. The dynamics of the system is first studied in the presence of both forces separately without noise. In the presence of only one of the forces, no resonance behaviour is observed, however, hysteresis happens there. Then the influence of the high-frequency force in the presence of a low-frequency, i.e. biharmonic forcing, is studied. Vibrational resonance is found to occur when the amplitude of the high-frequency force is varied. The resonance curve resembles a stochastic resonance-like curve. It is maximum at the value of $g$ at which the orbit lies in one well during one half of the drive cycle of the low-frequency force and in the other for the remaining half cycle. Vibrational resonance is characterized using the response amplitude and mean residence time. We show the occurrence of stochastic resonance behaviour in the overdamped system by replacing the high-frequency force by Gaussian noise.

Dissipative soliton generation and real-time dynamics in microresonator-filtered fiber lasers,"Chaotic Advection and the Emergence of Tori in the K\""uppers-Lortz State",False,"Optical frequency combs in microresonators (microcombs) have a wide range of applications in science and technology, due to its compact size and access to considerably larger comb spacing. Despite recent successes, the problems of self-starting, high mode efficiency as well as high output power have not been fully addressed for conventional soliton microcombs. Recent demonstration of laser cavity soliton microcombs by nesting a microresonator into a fiber cavity, shows great potential to solve the problems. Here we comprehensively study the dissipative soliton generation and interaction dynamics in a microresonator-filtered fiber laser in both theory and experiment. We first bring theoretical insight into the mode-locking principle, discuss the parameters effect on soliton properties and provide experimental guidelines for broadband soliton generation. We predict chirped bright dissipative soliton with flat-top spectral envelope in microresonators with normal dispersion, which is fundamentally infeasible for externally driven case. Furthermore, we experimentally achieve soliton microcombs with large bandwidth of ~10 nm and high mode efficiency of 90.7%. Finally, by taking advantage of an ultrahigh-speed time magnifier, we study the real-time soliton formation and interaction dynamics and experimentally observe soliton Newton's cradle. Our study will benefit the design of the novel, high-efficiency and self-starting microcombs for real-world applications.","Motivated by the roll-switching behavior observed in rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, we define a K\""uppers-Lortz (K-L) state as a volume-preserving flow with periodic roll switching. For an individual roll state, the Lagrangian particle trajectories are periodic. In a system with roll-switching, the particles can exhibit three-dimensional, chaotic motion. We study a simple phenomenological map that models the Lagrangian dynamics in a K-L state. When the roll axes differ by $120^{\circ}$ in the plane of rotation, we show that the phase space is dominated by invariant tori if the ratio of switching time to roll turnover time is small. When this parameter approaches zero these tori limit onto the classical hexagonal convection patterns, and, as it gets large, the dynamics becomes fully chaotic and well-mixed. For intermediate values, there are interlinked toroidal and poloidal structures separated by chaotic regions. We also compute the exit time distributions and show that the unbounded chaotic orbits are normally diffusive. Although the map presumes instantaneous switching between roll states, we show that the qualitative features of the flow persist when the model has smooth, overlapping time-dependence for the roll amplitudes (the Busse-Heikes model).",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

A Pseudo-BCS Wavefunction from Density Matrix Decomposition:Application in Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo,J-shaped stress-strain diagram of collagen fibers: Frame tension of triangulated surfaces with fixed boundaries,False,"We present a method to construct pseudo-BCS wave functions from the one-body density matrix. The resulting many-body wave function, which can be produced for any fermion systems, including those with purely repulsive interactions, has the form of a number-projected BCS form, or antisymmetrized germinal power (AGP). Such wave functions provide a better ansatz for correlated fermion systems than a single Slater determinant, and often better than a linear combination of Slater determinants (for example from a truncated active space calculation). We describe a procedure to build such a wave function conveniently from a given reduced density matrix of the system, rather than from a mean-field solution (which gives a Slater determinant for repulsive interactions). The pseudo-BCS wave function thus obtained reproduces the density matrix or minimizes the difference between the input and resulting density matrices. One application of the pseudo-BCS wave function is in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) calculations as the trial wave function to control the sign/phase problem. AFQMC is often among the most accurate general methods for correlated fermion systems. We show that the pseudo-BCS form further reduces the constraint bias and leads to improved accuracy compared to the usual Slater determinant trial wave functions, using the two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example. Furthermore, the pseudo-BCS trial wave function allows a new systematically improvable self-consistent approach, with pseudo-BCS trial wave function iteratively generated by AFQMC via the one-body density matrix.","We present Monte Carlo data of the stress-strain diagrams obtained using two different triangulated surface models. The first is the canonical surface model of Helfrich and Polyakov (HP), and the second is a Finsler geometry (FG) model. The shape of the experimentally observed stress-strain diagram is called J-shaped. Indeed, the diagram has a plateau for the small strain region and becomes linear in the relatively large strain region. Because of this highly non-linear behavior, the J-shaped diagram is far beyond the scope of the ordinary theory of elasticity. Therefore, the mechanism behind the J-shaped diagram still remains to be clarified, although it is commonly believed that the collagen degrees of freedom play an essential role. We find that the FG modeling technique provides a coarse-grained picture for the interaction between the collagen and the bulk material. The role of the directional degrees of freedom of collagen molecules or fibers can be understood in the context of FG modeling. We also discuss the reason for why the J-shaped diagram cannot (can) be explained by the HP (FG) model.",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

As a building block for operators of such type, we consider the heat kernel of the minimal operator - generic power of the Laplacian - and show that it is given by the expression essentially different from the conventional exponential Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) ansatz. Rather it is represented by the generalized exponential function (GEF) directly related to what is known in mathematics as the Fox-Wright $\varPsi$-functions and Fox $H$-functions. The structure of its essential singularity in the proper time parameter is different from that of the usual exponential ansatz, which invalidated previous attempts to directly generalize the Schwinger-DeWitt heat kernel technique to higher-derivative operators. In particular, contrary to the conventional exponential decay of the heat kernel in space, we show the oscillatory behavior of GEF for higher-derivative operators. We give several integral representations for the generalized exponential function, find its asymptotics and semiclassical expansion, which turns out to be essentially different for local operators and nonlocal operators of noninteger order. Finally, we briefly discuss further applications of the GEF technique to generic higher-derivative and pseudodifferential operators in curved space-time, which might be critically important for applications of Horava-Lifshitz and other UV renormalizable quantum gravity models.","Many lattice studies of heavy quark diffusion originate from a colour-electric correlator, obtained as a leading term after an expansion in the inverse of the heavy-quark mass. In view of the fact that the charm quark is not particularly heavy, we consider subleading terms in the expansion. Working out correlators up to $O(1/M^2)$, we argue that the leading corrections are suppressed by $O(T/M)$, and one of them can be extracted from a colour-magnetic correlator. The corresponding transport coefficient is non-perturbative already at leading order in the weak-coupling expansion, and therefore requires a non-perturbative determination.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Electric Vehicles and their Effect on Network Load,Beam extraction studies at 900 GeV using a channeling crystal,False,"The composition of the fleet of road cars is changing from fuel powered cars to plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and electrical vehicles (EV). The (electrical) range of these vehicles is limited, leading to so called `range anxiety'. Firstly, this leads to a preference of shorter routes. Secondly, (PH)EVs have the ability to regenerate energy from braking, which make routes with many accerelations and decelerations not as unattractive for drivers of (PH)EVs as for drivers of vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICE). This paper combines this, and adds drivers might prefer a lower speed limit due to a lower energy consumption. These elements are compared to with road characteristics. It is found, motorways are usually less favourable for drivers of (PH)EVs compared to drivers of ICE vehicles, and they will prefer the shorter routes on secondary roads or through towns. This will influence the use of the underlying road network, and thereby affecting congestion, emissions and safety. This shift towards the underlying road network needs to be taken into account in designs for the network.","Luminosity-driven channeling extraction has been observed for the first time in a 900 GeV study at the Fermilab Tevatron. This experiment, Fermilab E853, demonstrated that useful TeV level beams can be extracted from a superconducting accelerator during high luminosity collider operations without unduly affecting the background at the collider detectors. Multi-turn extraction was found to increase significantly the efficiency of the process. The beam extraction efficiency was about 25%. Studies of time dependent effects found that the turn-to-turn structure was governed mainly by accelerator beam dynamics. An investigation of a pre-scatterer using the accelerator flying wire system showed that a fiber could produce a significant extracted flux, consistent with expectations. Based on these results, it is feasible to construct a parasitic 5-10 MHz proton beam from the Tevatron collider.",Physics and Society,"Physics and society focuses on structure, dynamics and collective behavior of societies and groups (human or otherwise).

We also discuss the application of these results to the description of hadron or heavy ion collisions in the Color Glass Condensate framework.","The only known way to study quantum field theories in non-perturbative regimes is using numerical calculations regulated on discrete space-time lattices. Such computations, however, are often faced with exponential signal-to-noise challenges that render key physics studies untenable even with next generation classical computing. Here, a method is presented by which the output of small-scale quantum computations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era hardware can be used to accelerate larger-scale classical field theory calculations through the construction of optimized interpolating operators.

XMM Observations of the Seyfert 2 Galaxy NGC 7590: the Nature of X-ray Absorption,ROME III. The Arecibo Search for Auroral Emissions and Star-Planet Interactions at 5 GHz,False,"We present the analysis of three XMM observations of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7590. The source was found to have no X-ray absorption in the low spatial resolution ASCA data. The XMM observations provide a factor of 10 better spatial resolution than previous ASCA data. We find that the X-ray emission of NGC 7590 is dominated by an off-nuclear ULX and extended emission from the host galaxy. The nuclear X-ray emission is rather weak comparing with the host galaxy. Based on its very low X-ray luminosity as well as the small ratio between the 2-10 keV and the [O III] fluxes, we interpret NGC 7590 as Compton-thick rather than being an ""unobscured"" Seyfert 2 galaxy. Future higher resolution observations such as Chandra are crucial to shed light on the nature of NGC 7590 nucleus.","After nearly three decades of discovery, many exoplanetary systems have been studied and characterized in detail with one important exception: exoplanet magnetism. Although many surveys sought to detect magnetospheric radio emissions from exoplanets to directly measure their magnetic field strengths, they have yet to reveal an unambiguous detection. However, the indirect detection of exoplanet magnetic fields by measuring their influence on their host stars via magnetic star-planet interactions has recently gained prominence as an alternative method of discovery. This third paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted radio survey of eight nearby exoplanet-hosting systems that may engage in star-planet interactions. This survey, conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at $\sim$5 GHz, has the greatest frequency coverage of any to date, while providing mJy-level sensitivity over $<$1 s integration times.

"Reply to Comment on ""Statistical mechanics of developable ribbons""",Momentum resolved Floquet-engineered pair and single particle filter in the Fermi Hubbard model,False,"Starostin and van der Heijden [arXiv:1111.2029] question the validity of the results reported in our Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 238104 (2010)] regarding the existence of spontaneous helical structure in finite-temperature developable ribbons. According to the authors of the Comment, our setting is affected by a systematic error in the calculation of the torsion \tau\ that results in a bias of the Monte Carlo sampling toward helical configurations, and originates from the fact that the Frenet frame, used by us to describe the centerline of the ribbons, rotates by 180^{\circ} about the direction of the tangent vector every time an inflection point (i.e. a point where the curvature \kappa\ changes in sign) is encountered. While the rotation of the frame at infection points is a well known property of Frenet frame, the conclusions of Starostin and van der Heijden on how this phenomenon would affect the Monte Carlo sampling are incorrect, as are many of the other statements that they make.","We investigate the transport properties of a Fermi-Hubbard chain with an impurity which is formed by a site with a periodically modulated chemical potential.

Measurements at Michigan State are dominated by $E1$ contributions but have a small $E2$ component. On the other hand, a lower energy measurement at Notre Dame has a much stronger $E2$ contribution. The expectation was that the two measurements would tie down the $E2$ and thus allow for an accurate extraction of the $E1$ relevant for the capture process. The aim of this brief report is to show that the $E2$ factor in breakup reactions does not translate into a scaling of the $E2$ contribution in the corresponding capture reaction. We show that changes to the $^8$B single particle parameters, which are directly related to the $E2$ component in the capture reaction, do not effect the corresponding breakup reactions, using the present reaction theory.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Long-time unbreaking correlations in the large number of degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system,Pulse Bifurcations and Instabilities in an Excitable Medium: Computations in Finite Ring Domains,False,A behaviour of molecular cluster with Lennard-Jones potential of interactions as Hamiltonian system is studied by computer simulation (molecular dynamics method). It is shown that complex periodic oscillations of the cluster as a whole are possible. This is in accordance with KAM theorem.,We investigate the instabilities and bifurcations of traveling pulses in a model excitable medium; in particular we discuss three different scenarios for the loss of stability resp. the disappearance of stable pulses. In numerical simulations beyond the instabilities we observe replication of pulses (backfiring) resulting in complex periodic or spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics as well as modulated traveling pulses. We approximate the linear stability of traveling pulses through computations in a finite albeit large domain with periodic boundary conditions. The critical eigenmodes at the onset of the instabilities are related to the resulting spatiotemporal dynamics and act upon the back of the pulses.

Comparison of cosmological parameter inference methods applied to supernovae lightcurves fitted with SALT2,Multi-Messenger Gravitational Wave Searches with Pulsar Timing Arrays: Application to 3C66B Using the NANOGrav 11-year Data Set,False,"We present a comparison of two methods for cosmological parameter inference from supernovae Ia lightcurves fitted with the SALT2 technique. The standard chi-square methodology and the recently proposed Bayesian hierarchical method (BHM) are each applied to identical sets of simulations based on the 3-year data release from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3), and also data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Low Redshift sample and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), assuming a concordance LCDM cosmology. For both methods, we find that the recovered values of the cosmological parameters, and the global nuisance parameters controlling the stretch and colour corrections to the supernovae lightcurves, suffer from small biasses. The magnitude of the biasses is similar in both cases, with the BHM yielding slightly more accurate results, in particular for cosmological parameters when applied to just the SNLS3 single survey data sets. Most notably, in this case, the biasses in the recovered matter density $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$ are in opposite directions for the two methods. For any given realisation of the SNLS3-type data, this can result in a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy in the estimated value of $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$ between the two methods, which we find to be the case for real SNLS3 data. As more higher and lower redshift SNIa samples are included, however, the cosmological parameter estimates of the two methods converge.","When galaxies merge, the supermassive black holes in their centers may form binaries and, during the process of merger, emit low-frequency gravitational radiation in the process. In this paper we consider the galaxy 3C66B, which was used as the target of the first multi-messenger search for gravitational waves. Due to the observed periodicities present in the photometric and astrometric data of the source of the source, it has been theorized to contain a supermassive black hole binary. Its apparent 1.05-year orbital period would place the gravitational wave emission directly in the pulsar timing band. Since the first pulsar timing array study of 3C66B, revised models of the source have been published, and timing array sensitivities and techniques have improved dramatically. With these advances, we further constrain the chirp mass of the potential supermassive black hole binary in 3C66B to less than $(1.65\pm0.02) \times 10^9~{M_\odot}$ using data from the NANOGrav 11-year data set. This upper limit provides a factor of 1.6 improvement over previous limits, and a factor of 4.3 over the first search done. Nevertheless, the most recent orbital model for the source is still consistent with our limit from pulsar timing array data. In addition, we are able to quantify the improvement made by the inclusion of source properties gleaned from electromagnetic data to `blind' pulsar timing array searches.

The Isgur-Wise Function from the Lattice,MOND--particularly as modified inertia,False,"We calculate the Isgur-Wise function by measuring the elastic scattering amplitude of a $D$ meson in the quenched approximation on a $24^3\times48$ lattice at $\beta=6.2$, using an $O(a)$-improved fermion action. Fitting the resulting chirally-extrapolated Isgur-Wise function to Stech's relativistic-oscillator parametrization, we obtain a slope parameter $\rho^2=1.2+7-3. We then use this result, in conjunction with heavy-quark symmetry, to extract $V_{cb}$\ from the experimentally measured $\bar B\to D^*l\bar\nu\,$\ differential decay width. We find $|V_{cb}|\sqrt{\tau_B/1.48{\mathrm ps}}= 0.038 +2-2 +8-3, where the first set of errors is due to experimental uncertainties, while the second is due to the uncertainty in our lattice determination of $\rho^2$.","After a succinct review of the MOND paradigm--with its phenomenology, and its various underlying theories--I concentrate on so called modified inertia (MI) formulations of MOND, which have so far received only little attention. These share with all MOND theories the salient MOND predictions, such as asymptotically flat rotation curves, and the universal mass-asymptotic-speed relation. My emphasis here is, however, on the fact that MI theories can differ substantially from their ""modified-gravity"" (MG) kin in predicting other phenomena. Because MI theories are non local in time, MOND effects depend on the full trajectory of a system, not only on its instantaneous state, as in MG theories. This may lead to rather different predictions for, e.g., the external-field effect (EFE): A subsystem, such as a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, moving in the field of a mother galaxy, or a galaxy in a cluster, may be subject to an EFE that depends on the accelerations all along its orbit, not only on the instantaneous value. And, it is even possible to construct MI theories with practically no EFE. Other predictions that may differ are also discussed.

A Massive Young Star-Forming Complex Study in Infrared and X-ray: X-ray Sources in Ten Star Forming Regions,Geometric properties of acoustic waves generated by a point source in solar-like interior: effects of acoustic cut-off frequency,False,"The Massive Young star-forming complex Study in Infrared and X-ray (MYStIX) uses data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory to identify and characterize the young stellar populations in twenty Galactic (d < 4 kpc) massive star-forming regions. Here, the X-ray analysis for Chandra ACIS-I observations of ten of the MYStIX fields is described, and a catalog of >10,000 X-ray sources is presented. In comparison to other published Chandra source lists for the same regions, the number of MYStIX detected faint X-ray sources in a region is often doubled. While the higher catalog sensitivity increases the chance of false detections, it also increases the number of matches to infrared stars.

"Spectroscopic factors, overlaps, and isospin symmetry from an $R$-matrix point of view",Nuclear parton distribution functions and their effects on sin^2 theta_W anomaly,False,"Background: Spectroscopic factors, overlaps, and isospin symmetry are often used in conjunction with single-particle wave functions for the phenomenological analysis of nuclear structure and reactions. Many differing prescriptions for connecting these quantities to physically relevant asymptotic normalization constants or widths are available in the literature, but their relationship and degree of validity are not always clear. Purpose: This paper derives relationships among the above quantities of interest using well-defined methodology and starting assumptions. Method: $R$-matrix theory is used as the primary tool to interoperate between the quantities of interest to this work. Particular attention is paid to effects arising from beyond the nuclear surface, where isospin symmetry is strongly violated. Results: Relationships among the quantities of interest are derived. Example applications of these methods to mirror levels in nucleon+${}^{12}{\rm C}$, nucleon+${}^{16}{\rm O}$, and nucleon+${}^{26}{\rm Al}$ are presented. A new approach to multi-level mirror symmetry is derived and applied to the first three $2^+$ states of ${}^{18}{\rm O}$ and ${}^{18}{\rm Ne}$. Conclusions: The relationship between the quantities of interest is clarified and certain procedures are recommended. It is found that the asymptotic normalization constant of the second $2^+$ state in ${}^{18}{\rm Ne}$ deduced from the mirror state in ${}^{18}{\rm O}$ is significantly larger than found in previous work.

Formation and structure of vortex lattices in a rotating double-well Bose-Einstein condensate,Effective hamiltonian approach for strongly correlated lattice models,False,"We investigate the dynamics of vortex formation and the structure of vortex lattices in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined within a rotating double-well (DW) potential. The dynamical process is a formation process of ""ghost"" vortices, ""hidden"" vortices and ""visible"" vortices. The critical rotation frequency for the creation of visible vortex is indicated by a sudden jump in the angular momentum evolution and an inflexion in the energy evolution. Different visible vortex structures can be formed by ruling the rotation frequency. In particular, structural change of visible vortex patterns can be achieved by regulating the anisotropy parameter of the DW potential. This feature allows to flexibly control the distribution of angular momentum in macroscopic quantum systems and study the interplay among rotation, interparticle interaction and external potential in superfluids.","We review a recent approach for the simulation of many-body interacting systems based on an efficient generalization of the Lanczos method for Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. This technique allows to perform systematic corrections to a given variational wavefunction, that allow to estimate exact energies and correlation functions, whenever the starting variational wavefunction is a qualitatively correct description of the ground state. The stability of the variational wavefunction against possible phases, not described at the variational level can be tested by using the ''effective Hamiltonian'' approach. In fact Monte Carlo methods, such as the ''fixed node approximation'' and the ''generalized Lanczos technique'' (Phys. Rev. B 64,024512, 2001) allow to obtain exact ground state properties of an effective Hamiltonian, chosen to be as close as possible to the exact Hamiltonian, thus yielding the most reasonable estimates of correlation functions.

An Interacting Parton Model for Quark and Anti-quark distributions in the Baryon,ICARUS at the Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino Program -- Initial Operation,False,"In this paper we study a 1+1 dimensional relativistic parton model for the structure of baryons. The quarks and anti-quarks interact through a linear potential. We obtain an analytic formula for the isospin averaged valence quark distribution in the chiral and large Nc limits. The leading 1/Nc and non-zero current quark mass corrections are estimated. Then we extend this model to include `sea' and anti-quarks. We find that the anti-quark content is small at a low value of Q^2. Using these distributions as initial conditions for Q^2 evolution, we compare with experimental measurements of the structure function xF_3(x,Q^2) and find reasonable agreement. The only parameters we can adjust are the fraction of baryon momentum carried by valence quarks and the initial scale Q_0^2.","The ICARUS collaboration employed the 760-ton T600 detector in a successful three-year physics run at the underground LNGS laboratory studying neutrino oscillations with the CERN Neutrino to Gran Sasso beam (CNGS) and searching for atmospheric neutrino interactions.

HERMES: a Monte Carlo Code for the Propagation of Ultra-High Energy Nuclei,"Stellar Collisions in the Galactic Center: Massive Stars, Collision Remnants, and Missing Red Giants",False,"Although the recent experimental efforts to improve the observation of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) above $10^{18}$ eV, the origin and the composition of such particles is still unknown. In this work, we present the novel Monte Carlo code (HERMES) simulating the propagation of UHE nuclei, in the energy range between $10^{16}$ and $10^{22}$ eV, accounting for propagation in the intervening extragalactic and Galactic magnetic fields and nuclear interactions with relic photons of the extragalactic background radiation.

In this dense star cluster, direct collisions can occur between stars before they evolve off the main-sequence. Using a statistical approach, we characterize the outcomes of these stellar collisions within the inner parsec of the Galactic Center (GC). Close to the SMBH, where the velocity dispersion is larger than the escape speed from a Sun-like star, collisions lead to mass loss. We find that the stellar population within $0.01$ pc is halved within about a Gyr because of destructive collisions. Additionally, we predict a diffuse population of peculiar low-mass stars in the GC. These stars have been divested of their outer layers in the inner $0.01$ pc before migrating to larger distances from the SMBH. Between $0.01$ and $0.1$ pc from the SMBH, collisions can result in mergers. Our results suggest that repeated collisions between lower mass stars can produce massive ($\gtrsim 10$ M$_\odot$) stars, and there may be $\sim 100$ of them residing in this region.

Biweekly maps of SMADI were obtained from year 2010 to 2015 over all agricultural areas on Earth. The SMADI time-series were compared with state-of-the-art drought indices over the Iberian Peninsula. Results show a good agreement between SMADI and the Crop Moisture Index (CMI) retrieved at five weather stations (with correlation coefficient, R from -0.64 to -0.79) and the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) at the Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS) (R=-0.83). Some preliminary tests were also made over the continental United States using the Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI), with very encouraging results regarding the spatial occurrence of droughts during summer seasons. Additionally, SMADI allowed to identify distinctive patterns of regional drought over the Indian Peninsula in spring of 2012. Overall results support the use of SMADI for monitoring agricultural drought events world-wide.",Classical Physics,"Classical physics focuses on newtonian and relativistic dynamics; many particle systems; planetary motions; chaos in classical dynamics.

Measured proton electromagnetic structure deviates from theoretical predictions,Vector meson photoproduction processes near threshold,False,"The visible world is founded on the proton, the only composite building block of matter that is stable in nature. Consequently, understanding the formation of matter relies on explaining the dynamics and the properties of the proton's bound state.A fundamental property of the proton involves the response of the system to an external electromagnetic field. It is characterized by the electromagnetic polarizabilities that describe how easily the charge and magnetization distributions inside the system are distorted by the electromagnetic field. Moreover, the generalized polarizabilities map out the resulting deformation of the densities in a proton subject to an electromagnetic field. They disclose essential information about the underlying system dynamics and provide a key for decoding the proton structure in terms of the theory of the strong interaction that binds its elementary quark and gluon constituents. Of particular interest is a puzzle in the electric generalized polarizability of the proton that remains unresolved for two decades. Here we report measurements of the proton's electromagnetic generalized polarizabilities at low four-momentum transfer squared. We show evidence of an anomaly to the behaviour of the proton's electric generalized polarizability that contradicts the predictions of nuclear theory and derive its signature in the spatial distribution of the induced polarization in the proton. The reported measurements suggest the presence of a new, not-yet-understood dynamical mechanism in the proton and present notable challenges to the nuclear theory.","We discuss the photoproduction processes of light vector mesons ($\rho$, $\omega$, and $\phi$) from the nucleon near threshold. We first develop a simple model based on meson exchanges which is modified by the nucleon pole terms. We then extend this model to study other physically interesting topics. As examples, we discuss the missing nucleon resonances problem in $\omega$ photoproduction and the direct $\phi NN$ coupling constant in $\phi$ photoproduction. The calculated cross sections are compared with the recent experimental data. Various spin observables are discussed, which may be measured at current photon/electron facilities such as TJNAF and SPring-8 of RCNP.

Self-localization of directed polymers and oppressive population control,Marginal Fermi Liquid with a Two-Dimensional Patched Fermi Surface,False,"We construct a phenomenological theory of self-localization of directed polymers in d+1 dimensions. In d=1 we show that the polymer is always self-localized, whereas in d=2 there is a phase transition between localized and free states. We also map this system to a model of population dynamics with fixed total population. Our previous results translate to static and expanding population clusters, depending on the birth and death rates. A novel ``pseudo-travelling wave'' is observed in some sectors of parameter space.","We consider a model composed of Landau quasiparticle states with patched Fermi surfaces (FS) sandwiched by states with flat FS to simulate the ``cold'' spot regions in cuprates. We calculate the one particle irreducible function and the self-energy up to two-loop order. Using renormalization group arguments we show that in the forward scattering channel the renormalized coupling constant is never infrared stable due to the flat FS sectors. Furthemore we show that the self-energy scales with energy as ${\rm Re} \Sigma \sim \omega \ln \omega $ as $\omega \to 0$, and thus the Fermi liquid state within each FS patch is turned into a marginal Fermi liquid.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Synchronization of frustrated phase oscillators in the small-world networks,"Real soliton lattices of KP-II and desingularization of spectral curves: the Gr^{TP}(2,4) case",False,"We numerically study the synchronization of an identical population of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi phase oscillators in Watts-Strogatz networks. We find that, unlike random networks, phase-shift could enhance the synchronization in small-world networks. We also observe abrupt phase transition with hysteresis at some values of phase shifts in small-world networks, signs of an explosive phase transition. Moreover, we report the emergence of Chimera states at some values of phase-shift close to the transition points, which consist of spatially coexisting synchronized and desynchronized domains.","We apply the general construction developed in references [4,5] to the first non-trivial case of Gr^{TP}(2,4).

The $1/N_c$ expansion in hadron effective field theory,Jet separated by a large rapidity gap at the Tevatron and the LHC,False,"We study the $N_c$ scalings of pion-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon scatterings and find that a consistent large $N_c$ counting can be established if we assume Witten's counting rules are applied to matrix elements or scattering amplitudes which use the relativistic normalization for the nucleons. With the pionless effective field theory, we also find that the $S$-wave nucleon-nucleon interaction is so strong that it should be treated nonperturbatively at the leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion. By summing all the leading order diagrams, we find that the deuteron binding energy is of order $1/N_c$. In contrast, meson-meson interaction is so weak that loosely-bound meson-meson molecular states may not exist in the large $N_c$ limit.","We compare the recent measurements of gap between jets at the Tevatron and the LHC with the Balitski Fadin Kuraev Lipatov framework.

Temporal Evolution of Spatially-Resolved Individual Star Spots on a Planet-Hosting Solar-type Star: Kepler 17,Temperature Fluctuations as a Source of Brown Dwarf Variability,False,"Star spot evolution is visible evidence of the emergence/decay of the magnetic field on stellar surface, and it is therefore important for the understanding of the underlying stellar dynamo and consequential stellar flares. In this paper, we report the temporal evolution of individual star spot area on the hot-Jupiter-hosting active solar-type star Kepler 17 whose transits occur every 1.5 days. The spot longitude and area evolution are estimated (1) from the stellar rotational modulations of Kepler data and (2) from the brightness enhancements during the exoplanet transits caused by existence of large star spots. As a result of the comparison, number of spots, spot locations, and the temporal evolution derived from the rotational modulations is largely different from those of in-transit spots. We confirm that although only two light curve minima appear per rotation, there are clearly many spots present on the star. We find that the observed differential intensity changes are sometimes consistent with the spot pattern detected by transits, but they sometimes do not match with each other. Although the temporal evolution derived from the rotational modulation differs from those of in-transit spots to a certain degree, the emergence/decay rates of in-transit spots are within an order of magnitude of those derived for sunspots as well as our previous research based only on rotational modulations. This supports a hypothesis that the emergence/decay of sunspots and extremely-large star spots on solar-type stars occur through the same underlying processes.","A number of brown dwarfs are now known to be variable with observed amplitudes as large as 10-30% at some wavelengths. While spatial inhomogeneities in cloud coverage and thickness are likely responsible for much of the observed variability, it is possible that some of the variations arise from atmospheric temperature fluctuations instead of, or in addition to, clouds. To better understand the role that thermal variability might play we present a case study of brown dwarf variability using a newly-developed one-dimensional, time-stepping model of atmospheric thermal structure. We focus on the effects of thermal perturbations, intentionally simplifying the problem through omission of clouds and atmospheric circulation. Model results demonstrate that thermal perturbations occurring deep in the atmosphere (at pressures greater than 10 bar) of a model T-dwarf can be communicated to the upper atmosphere through radiative heating via the windows in near-infrared water opacity. The response time depends on where in the atmosphere a thermal perturbation is introduced. We show that, for certain periodic perturbations, the emission spectrum can have complex, time- and wavelength-dependent behaviors, including phase shifts in times of maximum flux observed at different wavelengths. Since different wavelengths probe different levels in the atmosphere, these variations track a wavelength-dependent set of radiative exchanges happening between different atmospheric levels as a perturbation evolves in time. We conclude that thermal--as well as cloud--fluctuations must be considered as possible contributors to the observed brown dwarf variability.",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"Solar and stellar astrophysics focuses on white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variables.

Non-Markovian dynamics of a microcavity coupled to a waveguide in photonic crystals,Collective excitation branch in the continuum of pair-condensed Fermi gases : analytical study and scaling laws,False,"In this paper, the non-Markovian dynamics of a microcavity coupled to a waveguide in photonic crystals is studied based on Fano-type tight binding model. Using the exact master equation, we solve analytically and numerically the temporal evolution of the cavity coherent state and the associated physical observables. A critical transition is revealed when the coupling increase between the cavity and the waveguide. In particular, the cavity field becomes dissipationless when the coupling strength goes beyond a critical value, as a manifestation of strong non-Markovian memory effect. The result also indicates that the cavity can maintain in a coherent state with arbitrary small number of photons when it strongly couples to the waveguide at very low temperature. These properties can be measured experimentally through the photon current flowing over the waveguide in photonic crystals.","The pair-condensed unpolarized spin-$1/2$ Fermi gases have a collective excitation branch in their pair-breaking continuum (V.A. Andrianov, V.N. Popov, 1976). We study it at zero temperature, with the eigenenergy equation deduced from the linearized time-dependent BCS theory and extended analytically to the lower half complex plane through its branch cut, calculating both the dispersion relation and the spectral weights (quasiparticle residues) of the branch. In the case of BCS superconductors, so called because the effect of the ion lattice is replaced by a short-range electron-electron interaction, we also include the Coulomb interaction and we restrict ourselves to the weak coupling limit $\Delta/\mu\to 0^+$ ($\Delta$ is the order parameter, $\mu $ the chemical potential) and to wavenumbers $q=O(1/\xi)$ where $\xi$ is the size of a pair; when the complex energy $z_q$ is expressed in units of $\Delta$ and $q$ in units of $1/\xi$, the branch follows a universal law insensitive to the Coulomb interaction. In the case of cold atoms in the BEC-BCS crossover, only a contact interaction remains, but the coupling strength $\Delta/\mu$ can take arbitrary values, and we study the branch at any wave number. At weak coupling, we predict three scales, that already mentioned $q\approx 1/\xi$, that $q\approx(\Delta/\mu)^{-1/3}/\xi$ where the real part of the dispersion relation has a minimum and that $q\approx (\mu/\Delta)/\xi\approx k_{\rm F}$ ($k_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave number) where the branch reaches the edge of its existence domain. Near the point where the chemical potential vanishes on the BCS side, $\mu/\Delta\to 0^+$, where $\xi\approx k_{\rm F}$, we find two scales $q\approx(\mu/\Delta)^{1/2}/\xi$ and $q\approx 1/\xi$. In all cases, the branch has a limit $2\Delta$ and a quadratic start at $q=0$. These results were obtained for $\mu>0$, where the eigenenergy equation admits at least two branch points $\epsilon_a(q)$ and $\epsilon_b(q)$ on the positive real axis, and for an analytic continuation through the interval $[\epsilon_a(q),\epsilon_b(q)] $. We find new continuum branches by performing the analytic continuation through $[\epsilon_b(q),+\infty[$ or even, for $q$ low enough, where there is a third real positive branch point $\epsilon_c(q)$, through $[\epsilon_b(q),\epsilon_c(q)]$ and $[\epsilon_c(q),+\infty[$. On the BEC side $\mu<0$ not previously studied, where there is only one real positive branch point $ \epsilon_a(q)$, we also find new collective excitation branches under the branch cut $[\epsilon_a (q),+\infty[$. For $\mu>0$, some of these new branches have a low-wavenumber exotic hypoacoustic $z_q\approx q^{3/2}$ or hyperacoustic $z_q\approx q^{4/5}$ behavior. For $\mu<0$, we find a hyperacoustic branch and a nonhypoacoustic branch, with a limit $2\Delta$ and a purely real quadratic start at $q=0$ for $\Delta/|\mu|<0.222$.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

A study on the effect of input data length on deep learning based magnitude classifier,Anharmonic quantum contribution to vibrational dephasing,False,"The rapid characterisation of earthquake parameters such as its magnitude is at the heart of Earthquake Early Warning (EEW). In traditional EEW methods the robustness in the estimation of earthquake parameters have been observed to increase with the length of input data. Since time is a crucial factor in EEW applications, in this paper we propose a deep learning based magnitude classifier and, further we investigate the effect of using five different durations of seismic waveform data after first P wave arrival of length 1s, 3s, 10s, 20s and 30s. This is accomplished by testing the performance of the proposed model that combines Convolution and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory units to classify waveforms based on their magnitude into three classes ""noise"", ""low magnitude events"" and ""high magnitude events"". Herein, any earthquake signal with magnitude equal to or above 5.0 is labelled as high magnitude. We show that the variation in the results produced by changing the length of the data, is no more than the inherent randomness in the trained models, due to their initialisation.","Based on a quantum Langevin equation and its corresponding Hamiltonian within a c-number formalism we calculate the vibrational dephasing rate of a cubic oscillator.

Novel Core-Shell Structures for Colloids made from Surfactants and Polymers,Ground-state phase diagram of two-component interacting bosons on a two-leg ladder,False,"We report on the formation of colloidal complexes resulting from the electrostatic self-assembly of polyelectrolyte-neutral block copolymers and oppositely charged surfactants. The copolymers investigated are asymmetric and characterized by a large neutral block. Using light, neutron and x-ray scattering experiments, we have shown that the colloidal complexes exhibit a core-shell microstructure. The core is described as a dense and disordered micro-phase of micelles connected by the polyelectrolyte blocks, whereas the shell is a diffuse brush made from the neutral chains. Colloidal complexes with core-shell structures resemble the well-known amphiphilic block copolymer micelles. The self-assembly mechanism is however different here. It is based on the complexation between opposite charges. This mechanism has recently attracted much interest because it allows to associate components of different nature, such as organic and inorganic or synthetic and biological.","Using the cluster Gutzwiller mean-field method, we numerically study the ground-state phase diagram of the non-hard-core two-component interacting bosons trapped in a two-leg ladder with and without an artificial magnetic field. Interestingly, several loophole supercounterfluid (SCF) phases are observed at a sufficiently small intra- to inter-leg hopping ratio when the magnetic flux is absent. While if the ratio is not too small, the loophole SCF phases can be induced by the effect of the magnetic flux as well. Additionally, we also find that the presence of the magnetic flux leads to an enlargement of the Mott insulator lobe and the conventional SCF lobe. We hope these results can improve the understanding of the interplay between lattice gases, gauge fields, and bosonic ladder systems.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Non-linear acceleration at supernova remnant shocks and the hardening in the cosmic ray spectrum,Beyond Einstein-Cartan gravity: Quadratic torsion and curvature invariants with even and odd parity including all boundary terms,False,"In the last few years several experiments have shown that the cosmic ray spectrum below the knee is not a perfect power-law. In particular, the proton and helium spectra show a spectral hardening by ~ 0.1-0.2 in spectral index at particle energies of ~ 200-300 GeV/nucleon. Moreover, the helium spectrum is found to be harder than that of protons by ~ 0.1 and some evidence for a similar hardening was also found in the spectra of heavier elements. Here we consider the possibility that the hardening may be the result of a dispersion in the slope of the spectrum of cosmic rays accelerated at supernova remnant shocks. Such a dispersion is indeed expected within the framework of non-linear theories of diffusive shock acceleration, which predict steeper (harder) particle spectra for larger (smaller) cosmic ray acceleration efficiencies.","Recently, gravitational gauge theories with torsion have been discussed by an increasing number of authors from a classical as well as from a quantum field theoretical point of view. The Einstein-Cartan(-Sciama-Kibble) Lagrangian has been enriched by the parity odd pseudoscalar curvature (Hojman, Mukku, and Sayed) and by torsion square and curvature square pieces, likewise of even and odd parity. (i) We show that the inverse of the so-called Barbero-Immirzi parameter multiplying the pseudoscalar curvature, because of the topological Nieh-Yan form, can only be appropriately discussed if torsion square pieces are included. (ii) The quadratic gauge Lagrangian with both parities, proposed by Obukhov et al. and Baekler et al., emerges also in the framework of Diakonov et al.(2011). We establish the exact relations between both approaches by applying the topological Euler and Pontryagin forms in a Riemann-Cartan space expressed for the first time in terms of irreducible pieces of the curvature tensor.

Decomposition of flow and nonflow in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,Projectile fragmentation reactions and production of nuclei near the neutron drip-line,False,"We propose a method to separate \Delta\eta-dependent and \Delta\eta-independent azimuthal correlations using two- and four-particle cumulants between pseudo-rapidity (\eta) bins in symmetric heavy-ion collisions. The \Delta\eta-independent correlation may be dominated by harmonic flows, a global correlation to the common collision geometry. The \Delta\eta-dependent correlation can be identified as nonflow, particle correlations unrelated to the common geometry. Our method exploits the \eta symmetry of the average harmonic flows and is ""data-driven."" We use the AMPT and HIJING event generators to illustrate our method. We discuss the decomposed \Delta\eta-independent and \Delta\eta-dependent correlations regarding flow and nonflow in the models.","The reaction mechanism of projectile fragmentation at intermediate energies has been investigated observing the target dependence of the production cross sections of very neutron-rich nuclei. Measurement of longitudinal momentum distributions of projectile-like fragments within a wide range of fragment mass and its charge was performed using a hundred-MeV/n $^{40}$Ar beam incident on Be and Ta targets. By measurement of fragment momentum distribution, a parabolic mass dependence of momentum peak shift was observed in the results of both targets, and a phenomenon of light-fragment acceleration was found only in the Be-target data. The analysis of production cross sections revealed an obvious enhancement of the target dependence except target size effect when the neutron excess is increased.

The details of the multi-stage model and the various parameter choices are described in [A. Kumar et al., arXiv:2204.01163]. A novel feature of this model is the presence of two stages of jet modification: a high virtuality phase (modeled using MATTER), where coherence effects diminish medium-induced radiation, and a lower virtuality phase (modeled using LBT), where parton splits are fully resolved by the medium as they endure multiple scattering induced energy loss. Energy loss calculations are carried out on event-by-event viscous fluid dynamic backgrounds constrained by experimental data. The uniformed and consistent descriptions of multiple experimental observables demonstrate the essential role of coherence effects and the multi-stage modeling of the jet evolution. Using the best choice of parameters from [A. Kumar et al., arXiv:2204.01163], and with no further tuning, we present calculations for the medium modified jet fragmentation function, the groomed jet momentum fraction $z_g$ and angular separation $r_g$ distributions, as well as the nuclear modification factor of groomed jets.

Coherent Multiple Backscattering of Waves in Random Medium beyond the Diffusion Approximation,The thickness of a liquid layer on the free surface of ice as obtained from computer simulation,False,"In this paper the validity of the diffusion approximation for multiple scattering of classical waves in random medium in different regimes is investigated, with emphasize to weak localization effects. Many principle topics are discussed once again. We obtain new expressions for the incoherent and coherent multiple scattering intensities for the more general case of large scattering angles and various observation points inside the medium with moving scatterers and absorption. (The results, we reached, assuming white-noise disorder for the impurities correlator, contain one-dimensional integration in its final analytical form). Also new self-consistent formulas for incoherent and coherent intensities for fixed multiplicity orders of scattering are given and their lineshapes are graphically represented. Through these formulas we clearly demonstrate that the impurities motion reduces the contribution to the intensity of the scatterings with large multiplicity orders. The total scattering intensities in $4\pi$ solid angle are calculated for the general case and compared with their diffusion approximation. For coherent intensities it is shown that a drastic deviation from the exact results occurs. It turns out that the region of angles, for which the observed lineshape of the weak localization effect tends to the incoherent background, give the main contribution to the total coherent scattered intensity. The last quantity happens to depend linearly instead of predicted quadratic dependence on the perturbation parameter, 1/kl.","Molecular dynamic simulations were performed for ice Ih with a free surface by using four water models, SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ice and TIP4P/2005. The behavior of the basal plane, the primary prismatic plane and of the secondary prismatic plane when exposed to vacuum was analyzed. We observe the formation of a thin liquid layer at the ice surface at temperatures below the melting point for all models and the three planes considered. For a given plane it was found that the thickness of a liquid layer was similar for different water models, when the comparison is made at the same undercooling with respect to the melting point of the model. The liquid layer thickness is found to increase with temperature. For a fixed temperature it was found that the thickness of the liquid layer decreases in the following order: the basal plane, the primary prismatic plane, and the secondary prismatic plane. For the TIP4P/Ice model, a model reproducing the experimental value of the melting temperature of ice, the first clear indication of the formation of a liquid layer appears at about -100 Celsius for the basal plane, at about -80 Celsius for the primary prismatic plane and at about -70 Celsius for the secondary prismatic plane.",Disordered Systems and Neural Networks,"Disordered systems and neural networks in condensed matter physics focuses on physical systems that are inherently non-crystalline or lack long-range order.

Low-frequency Current Fluctuations in Individual Semiconducting Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes,Localization in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and flux-line pinning in superconductors,False,"We present a systematic study on low-frequency current fluctuations of nano-devices consisting of one single semiconducting nanotube, which exhibit significant 1/f-type noise. By examining devices with different switching mechanisms, carrier types (electrons vs. holes), and channel lengths, we show that the 1/f fluctuation level in semiconducting nanotubes is correlated to the total number of transport carriers present in the system. However, the 1/f noise level per carrier is not larger than that of most bulk conventional semiconductors, e.g. Si. The pronounced noise level observed in nanotube devices simply reflects on the small number of carriers involved in transport. These results not only provide the basis to quantify the noise behavior in a one-dimensional transport system, but also suggest a valuable way to characterize low-dimensional nanostructures based on the 1/f fluctuation phenomenon.",A recent development in studies of random non-Hermitian quantum systems is reviewed.

Generalized negative flows in hierarchies of integrable evolution equations,Front and Turing patterns induced by Mexican-hat-like nonlocal feedback,False,"A one-parameter generalization of the hierarchy of negative flows is introduced for integrable hierarchies of evolution equations, which yields a wider (new) class of non-evolutionary integrable nonlinear wave equations. As main results, several integrability properties of these generalized negative flow equation are established, including their symmetry structure, conservation laws, and bi-Hamiltonian formulation. (The results also apply to the hierarchy of ordinary negative flows).

We show that the velocity of front propagation can be controlled up to a certain coupling strength beyond which spatially periodic patterns, such as Turing patterns or coexistence of spatially homogeneous solutions and Turing patterns, may be induced.

Calculation of the Excitations of Dense Quark Matter at Zero Temperature,Genus One Partition Function of the Calabi-Yau d-Fold embedded in ${CP^{d+1}}$,False,"Recently there has been a great deal of interest in studying the properties of dense quark matter, with particular reference to diquark condensates and color superconductivity. In the present work we report calculations made for the excitations of quark matter for relatively low densities of the deconfined phase and in the absence of meson or diquark condensation. Here, we are interested in elucidating the role of ""Pauli blocking"", as such blocking affects the calculation vector, scalar and pseudoscalar $q\bar q$ excitations. As a byproduct of our analysis, we extend our calculations to higher densities and explore some consequences of the use of density-dependent coupling parameters for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. (Such density-dependent parameters have been used in some of our previous work.) For our analysis made at large values of the matter density, we assume that at about 13 times nuclear matter density quark matter has only minimal nonperturbative interactions. At that high density we compare the result for hadronic current correlation functions calculated with density-dependent and density-independent NJL coupling constants. We find evidence for the use of density-dependent parameters, since the results with the density-independent constants do not go over to the perturbative description which we assume to be correct for $\rho\simeq 6\rho_c$, where $\rho_c$ is the matter density for the finite-density confinement-deconfinement transition. The use of density-dependent coupling constants in the study of diquark condensates and color superconductivity has not been explored as yet, and is a topic requiring further investigation, particularly given the strong interest in the properties of dense quark matter and color superconductivity.","For a one-parameter family of Calabi-Yau d-fold M embedded in ${{CP}^{d+1}}$, we consider a new quasi-topological field theory ${A^{\ast}}$(M)-model compared with the $A$(M)-model. The two point correlators on the sigma model moduli space (the hermitian metrics) are analyzed by the $A{A^{\ast}}$-fusion on the world sheet sphere. A set of equations of these correlators turns out to be a non-affine A-type Toda equation system for the d-fold M. This non-affine property originates in the vanishing first Chern class of M. Using the results of the $A{A^{\ast}}$-equation, we obtain a genus one partition function of the sigma model associated to the M in the recipe of the holomorphic anomaly. By taking an asymmetrical limit of the complexified {\kae} parameters ${\bar{t}\rightarrow \infty}$ and $t$ is fixed, the ${A^{\ast}}$(M)-model part is decoupled and we can obtain a partition function (or one point function of the operator ${{\cal O}^{(1)}}$ associated to a {\kae} form of M) of the $A$(M)-matter coupled with the topological gravity at the stringy one loop level.

International Large Detector: Interim Design Report,A Random Matrix Study of the QCD Sign Problem,False,"The ILD detector is proposed for an electron-positron collider with collision centre-of-mass energies from 90~\GeV~to about 1~\TeV. It has been developed over the last 10 years by an international team of scientists with the goal to design and eventually propose a fully integrated detector, primarily for the International Linear Collider, ILC. In this report the fundamental ideas and concepts behind the ILD detector are discussed and the technologies needed for the realisation of the detector are reviewed. The document starts with a short review of the science goals of the ILC, and how the goals can be achieved today with the detector technologies at hand. After a discussion of the ILC and the environment in which the experiment will take place, the detector is described in more detail, including the status of the development of the technologies foreseen for each subdetector. The integration of the different sub-systems into an integrated detector is discussed, as is the interface between the detector and the collider. This is followed by a concise summary of the benchmarking which has been performed in order to find an optimal balance between performance and cost. To the end the costing methodology used by ILD is presented, and an updated cost estimate for the detector is presented. The report closes with a summary of the current status and of planned future actions.","We investigate the severity of the sign problem in a random matrix model for QCD at finite temperature T and baryon chemical potential mu. We obtain analytic expression for the average phase factor -- the measure of the severity of the sign problem at arbitrary T and mu. We observe that the sign problem becomes less severe as the temperature is increased. We also find the domain where the sign problem is maximal -- the average phase factor is zero, which is related to the pion condensation phase in the QCD with finite isospin chemical potential. We find that, in the matrix model we studied, the critical point is located inside the domain of the maximal sign problem, making the point inaccessible to conventional reweighting techniques. We observe and describe the scaling behavior of the size and shape of the pion condensation near the chiral limit.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

"Absolute resonance strengths in the 6,7Li(alpha,gamma)10,11B reactions",Medium effect in high-density region probed by nucleus-nucleus elastic scattering,False,"The absolute strengths of the Ea=1175keV resonance in the 6Li(a,g)10B reaction and of the Ea=814 keV resonance in the 7Li(a,g)11B reaction have been measured to $\omega\gamma$=366+-38 meV and $\omega\gamma$=300+-32 meV, respectively, in good agreement with previous values. These resonances can be used to measure the absolute acceptance of the recoil separator ERNA to a precision of about 10%.","We investigate the sensitivity of the medium effect in the high-density region on the nucleus-nucleus elastic scattering in the framework of the double-folding (DF) model with the complex $G$-matrix interaction.

Characterising encapsulated nuclear waste using cosmic-ray muon tomography,The nature of the Lambda(1405) resonance in chiral dynamics,False,"Tomographic imaging techniques using the Coulomb scattering of cosmic-ray muons have been shown previously to successfully identify and characterise low- and high-Z materials within an air matrix using a prototype scintillating-fibre tracker system. Those studies were performed as the first in a series to assess the feasibility of this technology and image reconstruction techniques in characterising the potential high-Z contents of legacy nuclear waste containers for the UK Nuclear Industry. The present work continues the feasibility study and presents the first images reconstructed from experimental data collected using this small-scale prototype system of low- and high-Z materials encapsulated within a concrete-filled stainless-steel container. Clear discrimination is observed between the thick steel casing, the concrete matrix and the sample materials assayed. These reconstructed objects are presented and discussed in detail alongside the implications for future industrial scenarios.","The Lambda(1405) baryon resonance plays an outstanding role in various aspects in hadron and nuclear physics. It has been considered that the Lambda(1405) resonance is generated by the attractive interaction of the antikaon and the nucleon, as a quasi-bound state below the threshold decaying into the pi Sigma channel. Thus, the structure of Lambda(1405) is closely related to the Kbar N interaction which is the fundamental ingredient to study few-body systems with antikaon. In this paper, after reviewing the basic properties of the Lambda(1405) resonance, we introduce the dynamical coupled-channel model which respects chiral symmetry of QCD and the unitarity of the scattering amplitude. We show that the structure of the Lambda(1405) resonance is dominated by the meson-baryon molecule component and is described as a superposition of two independent states. The meson-baryon nature of Lambda(1405) leads to various hadronic molecule states in few-body systems with strangeness which are hadron composite systems driven by the hadronic interactions. We summarize the recent progress in the investigation of the Lambda(1405) structure and future perspective of the physics of the Lambda(1405) resonance.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

The accurate and comprehensive model of thin fluid flows with inertia on curved substrates,Vectorial Ribaucour Transformations for the Lame Equations,False,"Consider the 3D flow of a viscous Newtonian fluid upon a curved 2D substrate when the fluid film is thin as occurs in many draining, coating and biological flows. We derive a comprehensive model of the dynamics of the film, the model being expressed in terms of the film thickness and the average lateral velocity. Based upon centre manifold theory, we are assured that the model accurately includes the effects of the curvature of substrate, gravitational body force, fluid inertia and dissipation. The model may be used to resolve wave-like phenomena in the dynamics of viscous fluid flows over arbitrarily curved substrates such as cylinders, tubes and spheres. We briefly illustrate its use in simulating drop formation on cylindrical fibres, wave transitions, Faraday waves, viscous hydraulic jumps, and flow vortices in a compound channel. These models are the most complete models for thin film flow of a Newtonian fluid; many other thin film models can be obtained by different truncations of the dynamical equations given herein.","The vectorial extension of the Ribaucour transformation for the Lame equations of orthogonal conjugates nets in multidimensions is given. We show that the composition of two vectorial Ribaucour transformations with appropriate transformation data is again a vectorial Ribaucour transformation, from which it follows the permutability of the vectorial Ribaucour transformations. Finally, as an example we apply the vectorial Ribaucour transformation to the Cartesian background.",Chaotic Dynamics,"Chaotic dynamics in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of chaotic systems and dynamical systems that exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions, leading to behavior that appears to be random or unpredictable even though the systems are deterministic in nature. in paticular, this includes dynamical systems, chaos, quantum chaos, topological dynamics, cycle expansions, turbulence, and propagation."
Higgs Discovery before LHC?,(Pseudo)Scalar Charmonium in Finite Temperature QCD,False,The proposed Run IIb of the Tevatron Collider will provide 15 fb-1 worth of ppbar data at c.o.m energy of 2 TeV per experiment by year 2007. We review the plans of the Tevatron accelerator complex upgrade and the plans for the upgrades of the experiments to match this challenge. Perspectives for the discovery of an Higgs particle are reviewed and the concrete possibility of a 5 sigmas discovery for a low mass Higgs are discussed.,"The hadronic parameters of pseudoscalar ($\eta_c$) and scalar ($\chi_c$) charmonium are determined at finite temperature from Hilbert moment QCD sum rules. These parameters are the hadron mass, leptonic decay constant, total width, and continuum threshold ($s_0$). Results for $s_0(T)$ in both channels indicate that $s_0(T)$ starts approximately constant, and then it decreases monotonically with increasing $T$ until it reaches the QCD threshold, $s_{th} = 4 m_Q^2$, at a critical temperature $T = T_c \simeq 180 \; \mbox{MeV}$ interpreted as the deconfinement temperature. The other hadronic parameters behave qualitatively similarly to those of the $J/\psi$, as determined in this same framework. The hadron mass is essentially constant, the total width is initially independent of T, and after $T/T_c \simeq 0.80$ it begins to increase with increasing $T$ up to $T/T_c \simeq 0.90 \; (0.95)$ for $\chi_c$ ($\eta_c$), and subsequently it decreases sharply up to $T \simeq 0.94 \; (0.99) \; T_c$, for $\chi_c$ ($\eta_c$), beyond which the sum rules are no longer valid. The decay constant of $\chi_c$ at first remains basically flat up to $T \simeq 0.80\; T_c$, then it starts to decrease up to $T \simeq 0.90 \;T_c$, and finally it increases sharply with increasing $T$. In the case of $\eta_c$ the decay constant does not change up to $T \simeq 0.80 \;T_c$ where it begins a gentle increase up to $T \simeq 0.95 \;T_c$ beyond which it increases dramatically with increasing $T$. This behaviour contrasts with that of light-light and heavy-light quark systems, and it suggests the survival of the $\eta_c$ and the $\chi_c$ states beyond the critical temperature, as already found for the $J/\psi$ from similar QCD sum rules. These conclusions are very stable against changes in the critical temperature in the wide range $T_c = 180 - 260 \; \mbox{MeV}$.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Baryon production and net-proton distributions in relativistic heavy ion collisions,Manifestations of Isospin in Nearest Neighbor Spacing Distributions for the f-p Model Space,False,The higher order moments of the net-baryon distributions in relativistic heavy ion collisions are useful probes for the QCD critical point and fluctuations. We study the net-proton distributions and their moments in a simple model which considers the baryon stopping and pair production effects in the processes. It is shown that a single emission source model can explain the experimental data well. Centrality and energy dependence of the distributions and higher moments is discussed.,"The strong interactions are charge independent. If we limit ourselves to the strong interactions, we have the isospin $T$ as a good quantum number. Here we consider the lack of level repulsion of states of different isospin and how this effect manifests in nearest neighbor spacing (NNS) histograms, which provide a visual and statistical context in which to study distributions of energy level spacings. In particular, we study nucleons in the f-p model space for the nucleus $^{44}$Ti. We also study the effect of the Coulomb interaction on the level spacing distribution.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Polarization of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons along the beam direction in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV,From asymmetric nuclear matter to neutron stars: a functional renormalization group study,False,"The $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperon polarization along the beam direction has been measured for the first time in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The polarization dependence on the hyperons' emission angle relative to the second-order event plane exhibits a sine modulation, indicating a quadrupole pattern of the vorticity component along the beam direction. The polarization is found to increase in more peripheral collisions, and shows no strong transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence at $p_T>1$ GeV/$c$. The magnitude of the signal is about five times smaller than those predicted by hydrodynamic and multiphase transport models; the observed phase of the emission angle dependence is also opposite to these model predictions. In contrast, blast-wave model calculations reproduce the modulation phase measured in the data and capture the centrality and transverse momentum dependence of the signal once the model is required to reproduce the azimuthal dependence of the Gaussian source radii measured via the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss intensity interferometry technique.","A previous study of nuclear matter in a chiral nucleon-meson model is extended to isospin-asymmetric matter. Fluctuations beyond mean-field approximation are treated in the framework of the functional renormalization group. The nuclear liquid-gas phase transition is investigated in detail as a function of the proton fraction in asymmetric matter. The equations of state at zero temperature of both symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are found to be in good agreement with realistic many-body computations. We also study the density dependence of the pion mass in the medium. The question of chiral symmetry restoration in neutron matter is addressed; we find a stabilization of the phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry once fluctuations are included. Finally, neutron star matter including beta equilibrium is discussed. The model satisfies the constraints imposed by the existence of two-solar-mass neutron stars.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Small-scale Magnetic Flux Ropes in the First two Parker Solar Probe Encounters,The capacitance and electromechanical coupling of lipid membranes close to transitions. The effect of electrostriction,False,"Small-scale magnetic flux ropes (SFRs) are a type of structures in the solar wind that possess helical magnetic field lines. In a recent report (Chen & Hu 2020), we presented the radial variations of the properties of SFR from 0.29 to 8 au using in situ measurements from the Helios, ACE/Wind, Ulysses, and Voyager spacecraft. With the launch of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), we extend our previous investigation further into the inner heliosphere. We apply a Grad-Shafranov-based algorithm to identify SFRs during the first two PSP encounters. We find that the number of SFRs detected near the Sun is much less than that at larger radial distances, where magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence may act as the local source to produce these structures. The prevalence of Alfvenic structures significantly suppresses the detection of SFRs at closer distances. We compare the SFR event list with other event identification methods, yielding a dozen well-matched events. The cross-section maps of two selected events confirm the cylindrical magnetic flux rope configuration. The power-law relation between the SFR magnetic field and heliocentric distances seems to hold down to 0.16 au.","Biomembranes are thin capacitors with the unique feature of displaying phase transitions in a physiologically relevant regime. We investigate the voltage and lateral pressure dependence of their capacitance close to their chain melting transition. Since the gel and the fluid membrane have different area and thickness, the capacitance of the two membrane phases is different. In the presence of external fields, charges exert forces that can influence the state of the membrane, thereby influencing the transition temperature. This phenomenon is called electrostriction. We show that this effect allows us to introduce a capacitive susceptibility that assumes a maximum in the melting transition with an associated excess charge. As a consequence, there exist voltage regimes where a small change in voltage can lead to a large uptake of charge and a large capacitive current. Furthermore, we consider electromechanical behavior such as pressure-induced changes in capacitance, and the application of such concepts in biology.",Space Physics,"Space physics focuses on space plasma physics.

A new computational method for a model of C. elegans biomechanics: Insights into elasticity and locomotion performance,Neural Networks for Constitutive Modeling -- From Universal Function Approximators to Advanced Models and the Integration of Physics,False,"An organism's ability to move freely is a fundamental behaviour in the animal kingdom. To understand animal locomotion requires a characterisation of the material properties, as well as the biomechanics and physiology. We present a biomechanical model of C. elegans locomotion together with a novel finite element method. We formulate our model as a nonlinear initial-boundary value problem which allows the study of the dynamics of arbitrary body shapes, undulation gaits and the link between the animal's material properties and its performance across a range of environments. Our model replicates behaviours across a wide range of environments. It makes strong predictions on the viable range of the worm's Young's modulus and suggests that animals can control speed via the known mechanism of gait modulation that is observed across different media.","Analyzing and modeling the constitutive behavior of materials is a core area in materials sciences and a prerequisite for conducting numerical simulations in which the material behavior plays a central role. Constitutive models have been developed since the beginning of the 19th century and are still under constant development. Besides physics-motivated and phenomenological models, during the last decades, the field of constitutive modeling was enriched by the development of machine learning-based constitutive models, especially by using neural networks. The latter is the focus of the present review, which aims to give an overview of neural networks-based constitutive models from a methodical perspective. The review summarizes and compares numerous conceptually different neural networks-based approaches for constitutive modeling including neural networks used as universal function approximators, advanced neural network models and neural network approaches with integrated physical knowledge.

Inflationary Imprints on Dark Matter,Insight into $D/B\to \pi \ell \nu_\ell$ decay using the pole models,False,"We show that dark matter abundance and the inflationary scale $H$ could be intimately related. Standard Model extensions with Higgs mediated couplings to new physics typically contain extra scalars displaced from vacuum during inflation. If their coupling to Standard Model is weak, they will not thermalize and may easily constitute too much dark matter reminiscent to the moduli problem. As an example we consider Standard Model extended by a $Z_2$ symmetric singlet $s$ coupled to the Standard Model Higgs $\Phi$ via $\lambda \Phi^{\dag}\Phi s^2$. Dark matter relic density is generated non-thermally for $\lambda \lesssim 10^{-7}$. We show that the dark matter yield crucially depends on the inflationary scale. For $H\sim 10^{10}$ GeV we find that the singlet self-coupling and mass should lie in the regime $\lambda_{\rm s}\gtrsim 10^{-9}$ and $m_{\rm s}\lesssim 50$ GeV to avoid dark matter overproduction.","After improving the knowledge about residua of the semileptonic form factor at its first two poles we show that $f_+^{D\pi}(q^2)$ is not saturated when compared with the experimental data. To fill the difference we approximate the rest of discontinuity by an effective pole and show that the data can be described very well with the position of the effective pole larger than the next excitation in the spectrum of $D^\ast$ state. The results of fits with experimental data also suggest the validity of superconvergence which in the pole models translates to a vanishing of the sum of residua of the form factor at all poles. A similar discussion in the case of $B\to \pi \ell\nu_\ell$ leads to the possibility of extracting $\vert V_{ub}\vert$, the error of which appears to be dominated by $g_{B^\ast B\pi}$, which can be nowadays computed on the lattice. In evaluating the residua of the form factors at their nearest pole we needed the vector meson decay constants $f_{D^\ast}$ and $f_{B^\ast}$, which we computed by using the numerical simulations of QCD on the lattice with $N_{\rm f}=2$ dynamical quarks. We obtain, $f_{D^\ast}/f_D=1.208(27)$ and $f_{B^\ast}/f_B=1.051(17)$.",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology,"High energy physics - phenomenology focuses on theoretical and phenomenological research related to the understanding of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.

On the effectiveness of effective field theory in peripheral nucleon-nucleon scattering,Di-jet measurements in heavy-ion collisions at STAR,False,"Peripheral nucleon-nucleon scattering is analysed in the framework of an effective field theory. Distorted-wave methods are used to remove the effects of one-pion exchange. Two-pion exchange and recoil corrections to one-pion exchange are then subtracted pertubatively. This removes all contributions up to order Q^3 in the chiral expansion. We have applied this to the 1D2, 1F3 and 1G4 waves, using phase shifts from various partial-wave analyses by the Nijmegen group. In regions where these analyses agree we find no evidence for a breakdown of the chiral expansion. One of the terms in the effective short-range potential, the leading one in the 1D2 channel, is larger might be expected, but in general these terms have momentum scales of about 300-400 MeV. We also see hints of isospin breaking in the pi-N couplings.","Jets are produced from hard scatterings in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. It is expected that these high-$p_T$ partons travel through the hot and dense medium before fragmenting. Therefore they are expected to suffer energy loss in the QGP via gluon radiation and elastic collisions along their path. Measurements of fully reconstructed jets help understand the effect of the energy loss on the jet structure and energy profile. A data-driven characterization of the background in Au+Au is needed in order to compare the results to p+p. The full azimuthal coverage of STAR Time Projection Chamber and Electromagnetic Calorimeter allows measurements of fully reconstructed di-jets, defined by jets that match the online trigger and recoil jets on the away side. A tight selection of the trigger jets allows for a selection of those coming from the surface. Hence, the population of jets on the recoil side is biased towards a maximal energy loss because of the extreme in-medium pathlength.

Vortex Fluctuations in High-Tc Films: Flux Noise Spectrum and Complex Impedance,Size-dependent bandgap and particle size distribution of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals,False,"The flux noise spectrum and complex impedance for a 500 {\AA} thick YBCO film are measured and compared with predictions for two dimensional vortex fluctuations. It is verified that the complex impedance and the flux noise spectra are proportional to each other, that the logarithm of the flux noise spectra for different temperatures has a common tangent with slope $\approx -1$, and that the amplitude of the noise decreases as $d^{-3}$, where $d$ is the height above the film at which the magnetic flux is measured. A crossover from normal to anomalous vortex diffusion is indicated by the measurements and is discussed in terms of a two-dimensional decoupling.","A new analytical expression for the size-dependent bandgap of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals is proposed within the framework of the finite-depth square-well effective mass approximation in order to provide a quantitative description of the quantum confinement effect. This allows one to convert optical spectroscopic data (photoluminescence spectrum and absorbance edge) into accurate estimates for the particle size distributions of colloidal systems even if the traditional effective mass model is expected to fail, which occurs typically for very small particles belonging to the so-called strong confinement limit. By applying the reported theoretical methodologies to CdTe nanocrystals synthesized through wet chemical routes, size distributions are inferred and compared directly to those obtained from atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.

Quark Pair Production in the Chiral Phase Transition,Sfermion Precision Measurements at a Linear Collider,False,"The production of quarks and antiquarks during a sudden restoration of chiral symmetry, as it might occur in very energetic heavy ion collisions, is considered. If gluons are already present they can assist additively to the overall production: real gluons are partially decaying during such a chiral transition. The total number of produced quarks is calculated and found to be quite sizeable. It is speculated that such a phenomenon could give rise to a significant contribution to the overall quark pair creation in the preequilibrium stage of the heavy ion collision.","At future e+- e- linear colliders, the event rates and clean signals of scalar fermion production - in particular for the scalar leptons - allow very precise measurements of their masses and couplings and the determination of their quantum numbers. Various methods are proposed for extracting these parameters from the data at the sfermion thresholds and in the continuum. At the same time, NLO radiative corrections and non-zero width effects have been calculated in order to match the experimental accuracy. The substantial mixing expected for the third generation sfermions opens up additional opportunities.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking of photonic and matter waves in two-dimensional pseudopotentials,Suppression of chaos by weak resonant excitations in a nonlinear oscillator with a non-symmetric potential,False,"We introduce the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii/nonlinear-Schrodinger (GP/NLS) equation with the self-focusing nonlinearity confined to two identical circles, separated or overlapped. The model can be realized in terms of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and photonic-crystal fibers. Following the recent analysis of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of localized modes trapped in 1D and 2D double-well nonlinear potentials (also known as pseudopotentials), we aim to find 2D solitons in the two-circle setting, using numerical methods and the variational approximation (VA). Well-separated circles support stable symmetric and antisymmetric solitons. The decrease of separation L between the circles leads to destabilization of the solitons. The symmetric modes undergo two SSB transitions. First, they are transformed into weakly asymmetric breathers, which is followed by a transition to single-peak modes trapped in one circle. The antisymmetric solitons perform a direct transition to the single-peak mode. The symmetric solitons are described reasonably well by the VA. For touching (L=0) and overlapping (L<0) circles, single-peak solitons are found-asymmetric ones, trapped in either circle, and symmetric solitons centered at the midpoint of the bi-circle configuration. If the overlap is weak, the symmetric soliton is unstable. It may spontaneously leap into either circle and perform shuttle motion in it. A region of stability of the symmetric solitons appears with the increase of the overlap degree. In the case of a moderately strong overlap, another SSB effect is found, in the form of a pair of symmetry-breaking and restoring bifurcations which link families of the symmetric and asymmetric solitons.",We examine the Mielnikov criterion for transition to chaos in case of one degree of freedom nonlinear oscillator with non symmetric potential.

We are therefore able to trace the evolution of the shock velocity in the dense and partially opaque circumstellar medium (CSM), from $\sim 4800~km~s^{-1}$ at +48 d, decreasing as $t^{-0.23}$ to $\sim 2700~km~s^{-1}$ after a year. We perform spectral modeling of both the broad- and intermediate-velocity components of the H$\alpha$ line profile. The high-velocity component is consistent with emission from a radially thin, spherical shell located behind the expanding shock with emission wings broadened by electron scattering. We propose that the intermediate component originates from pre-ionized gas from the unshocked dense CSM with the same velocity as the narrow component, $\sim 100~km~s^{-1}$, but also broadened by electron scattering. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SN 2013L after +132 d are well reproduced by a two-component black-body (BB) model. The circumstellar-interaction model of the bolometric light curve reveals a mass-loss rate history with large values ($1.7\times 10^{-2} - 0.15~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$) over the $\sim $25 - 40 years before explosion. The drop in the light curve at $\sim 350$ days and presence of electron scattering wings at late epochs indicate an anisotropic CSM. The mass-loss rate values and the unshocked CSM velocity are consistent with the characteristics of a massive star, such as a luminous blue variable (LBV) undergoing strong eruptions, similar to $\eta$ Carina.","We use multiband archival HST observations to measure the photometric and structural parameters of the M81 globular cluster that hosts the Fast Radio Burst FRB 20200120E. Our best-fitting King model has an effective radius $r_h = 3.06$ pc with a moderate King model concentration of $c = 53$, and an inferred core radius of 0.81 pc. We revisit the exact astrometric location of the FRB within the cluster, and find that FRB 20200120E is located 1.92 pc from the center, but within the projected half-light radius. We estimate the relative encounter rate of the FRB host, along with the corresponding rates of 210 other globular clusters in M81, and compare these values with the encounter rates of Galactic globular clusters. The FRB resides in a globular cluster with an encounter rate that is moderately higher than the median stellar encounter rate in our two comparison samples. While the estimated encounter rate of the FRB host cluster (e.g., $\sim50\%$ of a cluster like 47 Tuc) is sufficient to allow the possibility that the FRB formed dynamically, our results do not place strong constraints on this scenario due to the limitations of the available HST data and the possible systematic uncertainties and selection effects in the comparison data.",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,"Solar and stellar astrophysics focuses on white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, cataclysmic variables.

Lithospheric delamination beneath the southern Puna plateau resolved by local earthquake tomography,Gallium-nitride-based interference-filter-stabilized external cavity diode laser with a surface-activated-bonded output coupler,False,"We present a local earthquake tomography to illuminate the crustal and uppermost mantle structure beneath the southern Puna plateau and to test the delamination hypothesis. Vp and Vp/Vs ratios were obtained using travel time variations recorded by 75 temporary seismic stations between 2007 and 2009. In the upper crust, prominent low Vp anomalies are found beneath the main volcanic centers, indicating the presence of magma and melt beneath the southern Puna plateau. In the lowlands to the southeast of the Puna plateau, below the Sierras Pampeanas, a high Vp body is observed in the crust. Beneath the Moho at around 90 km depth, a strong high Vp anomaly is detected just west of the giant backarc Cerro Galan Ignimbrite caldera with the robustness of this feature being confirmed by multiple synthetic tests. This high velocity body can be interpreted as a delaminated block of lower crust and uppermost mantle lithosphere under the southern Puna plateau. The low velocities in the crust can be interpreted as having been induced by the delamination event that triggered the rise of fluids and melts into the crust and induced the high topography in this part of the plateau. The tomography also reveals low velocity anomalies that link arc magnetism at the Ojos del Salado volcanic center with slab seismicity clusters at depths of about 100 and 150 km and support fluid fluxing in the mantle wedge due to dehydration reaction within the subducted slab.","We report on an interference-filter-stabilized external cavity diode laser using a gallium-nitride-based violet laser diode. Surface-activated-bonded glass substrates were employed as cat's eye output couplers in order to suppress power degradation due to optical damage. From the results of a long-term frequency-stabilization test, mode-hop-free operation for about one week was demonstrated. After a continuous operation of about three weeks, the power degradation was less than 10$\%$. The results show the potential of such interference-filter-stabilized external cavity diode lasers for practical and portable quantum technologies such as atomic clocks or atomic interferometers.",Geophysics,Geophysics focuses on atmospheric physics.

Charge reversal of colloidal particles,Features of spin-charge separation in the equilibrium conductance through finite rings,False,"A theory is presented for the effective charge of colloidal particles in suspensions containing multivalent counterions. It is shown that if colloids are sufficiently strongly charged, the number of condensed multivalent counterion can exceed the bare colloidal charge leading to charge reversal. Charge renormalization in suspensions with multivalent counterions depends on a subtle interplay between the solvation energies of the multivalent counterions in the bulk and near the colloidal surface. We find that the effective charge is {\it not} a monotonically decreasing function of the multivalent salt concentration. Furthermore, contrary to the previous theories, it is found that except at very low concentrations, monovalent salt hinders the charge reversal. This conclusion is in agreement with the recent experiments and simulations.","We calculate the conductance through rings with few sites $L$ described by the $t-J$ model, threaded by a magnetic flux $\Phi$ and weakly coupled to conducting leads at two arbitrary sites. The model can describe a circular array of quantum dots with large charging energy $U$ in comparison with the nearest-neighbor hopping $t$. We determine analytically the particular values of $\Phi$ for which a depression of the transmittance is expected as a consequence of spin-charge separation. We show numerically that the equilibrium conductance at zero temperature is depressed at those particular values of $\Phi $ for most systems, in particular at half filling, which might be easier to realize experimentally.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Bistable analytic-phase synchronization in strongly-competing chaotic lasing modes,Conservation laws and symmetries of Hunter-Saxton equation: revisited,False,"We theoretically study analytic-phase synchronization in strongly-competing oscillator systems. Using the example of composite-cavity modes coupled via a class-B laser active medium, we discover that inherent chaotic phase synchronization can arise concurrently at two different chaotic attractors, leading to bistable phase-synchronized solutions. In our example, the underlying mechanism for bistability and inherent phase synchronization is population pulsation within the active medium.","Through a reciprocal transformation $\mathcal{T}_0$ induced by the conservation law $\partial_t(u_x^2) = \partial_x(2uu_x^2)$, the Hunter-Saxton (HS) equation $u_{xt} = 2uu_{2x} + u_x^2$ is shown to possess conserved densities involving arbitrary smooth functions, which have their roots in infinitesimal symmetries of $w_t = w^2$, the counterpart of the HS equation under $\mathcal{T}_0$. Hierarchies of commuting symmetries of the HS equation are studied under appropriate changes of variables initiated by $\mathcal{T}_0$, and two of these are linearized while the other is identical to the hierarchy of commuting symmetries admitted by the potential modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. A fifth order symmetry of the HS equation is endowed with a sixth order hereditary recursion operator by its connection with the Fordy-Gibbons equation.

Identification of High $\rm p_{\perp}$ Particles with the STAR-RICH Detector,Extraction of the pion distribution amplitude from polarized muon pair production,False,The STAR-RICH detector extends the particle identification capapbilities of the STAR experiment for charged hadrons at mid-rapidity. This detector represents the first use of a proximity-focusing CsI-based RICH detector in a collider experiment. It provides identification of pions and kaons up to 3 GeV/c and protons up to 5 GeV/c. The characteristics and performance of the device in the inaugural RHIC run are described.,"We consider the production of muon pairs from the scattering of pions on longitudinally polarized protons. We calculate the cross section and the single spin asymmetry for this process, taking into account pion bound state effects. We work in the kinematic region where the photon has a large longitudinal momentum fraction, which allows us to treat the bound state problem perturbatively. Our predictions are directly proportional to the pion distribution amplitude.

Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $SL(2)$ and their quantization,Towards symmetric discretization schemes via weak boundary conditions,False,All possible graded Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $SL(2)$ are described. We prove that differential Poisson-Lie structures prolonging the Sklyanin brackets do not exist on $SL(2)$. There are two and only two graded Poisson-Lie structures on $SL (2)$ and neither of them can be obtained by a reduction of graded Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $GL(2)$. Both of them can be quantized and as a result we get a new graded algebra of quantum right-invariant forms on $SL_q(2)$ with three generators.,"The Szymanzik improvement program for gauge theories is most commonly implemented using forward finite difference corrections to the Wilson action. Central symmetric schemes naively applied, suffer from a doubling of degrees of freedom, identical to the well known fermion doubling phenomenon. And while adding a complex Wilson term remedies the problem for fermions, it does not easily transfer to real-valued gauge fields. In this talk I report on recent progress in formulating symmetric discretization schemes for classical actions of simple one-dimensional problems. They avoid doubling by exploiting the weak imposition of initial/boundary conditions. Inspired by recent work in the field of numerical analysis of partial differential equations, I construct a regularized summation-by-parts finite difference operator using boundary data based on affine coordinates. Application to a classical initial value problems with second order derivatives are presented.",High Energy Physics - Theory,"High energy physics - theory focuses on formal aspects of quantum field theory.

Excitatory and inhibitory interactions affect the balance of chorus activity and energy efficiency in the aggregation of male frogs: Theoretical study using a hybrid dynamical model,Energy Gradient Theory of Hydrodynamic Instability,False,"We theoretically study the role of excitatory and inhibitory interactions in the aggregations of male frogs. In most frogs, males produce sounds to attract conspecific females, which activates the calling behavior of other males and results in collective choruses. While the calling behavior is quite effective for mate attraction, it requires high energy consumption. In contrast, satellite behavior is an alternative mating strategy in which males deliberately stay silent in the vicinity of a calling male and attempt to intercept the female attracted to the caller, allowing the satellite males to drastically reduce their energy consumption while having a chance of mating. Here we propose a hybrid dynamical model in which male frogs autonomously switch among three behavioral states (i.e., calling state, resting state, and satellite state) due to the excitatory and inhibitory interactions. Numerical simulation of the proposed model demonstrated that (1) both collective choruses and satellite behavior can be reproduced and (2) the satellite males can prolong the energy depletion time of the whole aggregation while they split the maximum chorus activity into two levels over the whole chorusing period. This study theoretically highlights the trade-off between energy efficiency and chorus activity in the aggregations of male frogs driven by the multiple types of interactions.","A new universal theory for flow instability and turbulent transition is proposed in this study. Flow instability and turbulence transition have been challenging subjects for fluid dynamics for a century. The critical condition of turbulent transition from theory and experiments differs largely from each other for Poiseuille flows. In this paper, a new mechanism of flow instability and turbulence transition is presented for parallel shear flows and the energy gradient theory of hydrodynamic instability is proposed. It is stated that the total energy gradient in the transverse direction and that in the streamwise direction of the main flow dominate the disturbance amplification or decay. A new dimensionless parameter K for characterizing flow instability is proposed for wall bounded shear flows, which is expressed as the ratio of the energy gradients in the two directions. It is thought that flow instability should first occur at the position of Kmax which may be the most dangerous position. This speculation is confirmed by Nishioka et al's experimental data. Comparison with experimental data for plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow indicates that the proposed idea is really valid. It is found that the turbulence transition takes place at a critical value of Kmax of about 385 for both plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow, below which no turbulence will occur regardless the disturbance. More studies show that the theory is also valid for plane Couette flows and Taylor-Couette flows between concentric rotating cylinders.",Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems,"Adaptation and self-organizing systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that exhibit adaptive behavior and self-organization.

Viscosity and thermodynamic properties of QGP in relativistic heavy ion collisions,String breaking and monopoles,False,"We study the viscosity and thermodynamic properties of QGP at RHIC by employing the recently extracted equilibrium distribution functions from two hot QCD equations of state of $O(g^5)$ and $O(g^6\ln(1/g))$ respectively. After obtaining the temperature dependence of energy density, and entropy density, we focus our attention on the determination of shear viscosity for a rapidly expanding interacting plasma, as a function of temperature. We find that interactions significantly decrease the shear viscosity. They decrease the viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/{\mathcal S}$ as well.","The string breaking is discussed in U(1)^{N-1} Abelian effective theories of QCD. When a screening is expected, the static potential shows a flattening in the long-range region and a linear behavior in the intermediate region. We show why the screening is better observed in the Polyakov-loop correlators than in the Wilson loops.

The spreading of computer viruses on time-varying networks,Some Aspects of FELWI,False,"Social networks are the prime channel for the spreading of computer viruses. Yet the study of their propagation neglects the temporal nature of social interactions and the heterogeneity of users' susceptibility. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that captures both properties. We study two realistic types of viruses propagating on temporal networks featuring Q categories of susceptibility and derive analytically the invasion threshold. We found that the temporal coupling of categories might increase the fragility of the system to cyber threats. Our results show that networks' dynamics and their interplay with users features are crucial for the spreading of computer viruses.",A threshold condition for amplification without inversion in a free-electron laser without inversion (FELWI) is determined. This condition is found to be too severe for the effect to be observed in an earlier suggested scheme because a threshold intensity of the field to be amplified appears to be too high.

First application of combined isochronous and Schottky mass spectrometry: Half-lives of fully ionized 49Cr24+ and 53Fe26+ atoms,Lense Thirring and Geodetic Effects,False,Lifetime measurements of b -decaying highly charged ions have been performed in the storage ring CSRe by applying the isochronous Schottky mass spectrometry. The fully ionized 49Cr and 53Fe ions were produced in projectile fragmentation of 58Ni primary beam and were stored in the CSRe tuned into the isochronous ion-optical mode. The new resonant Schottky detector was applied to monitor the intensities of stored uncooled 49Cr24+ and 53Fe26+ ions. The extracted half-lives T1/2(49Cr24+) = 44.0(27) min and T1/2(53Fe26+) = 8.47(19) min are in excellent agreement with the literature half-life values corrected for the disabled electron capture branchings. This is an important proof-of-principle step towards realizing the simultaneous mass and lifetime measurements on exotic nuclei at the future storage ring facilities.,"Using the Einstein gravitation theory (EGT), we analyze the Lense Thirring (LT) and the Geodetic effects.

Early science with Korean VLBI network: the QCAL-1 43GHz calibrator survey,The destiny of Dark Matter,False,"This paper presents the catalog of correlated flux densities in three ranges of baseline projection lengths of 637 sources from a 43 GHz (Q-band) survey observed with the Korean VLBI Network. Of them, 623 sources have not been observed before at Q-band with VLBI. The goal of this work in the early science phase of the new VLBI array is twofold: to evaluate the performance of the new instrument that operates in a frequency range of 22-129 GHz and to build a list of objects that can be used as targets and as calibrators. We have observed the list of 799 target sources with declinations down to -40 degrees. Among them, 724 were observed before with VLBI at 22 GHz and had correlated flux densities greater than 200 mJy. The overall detection rate is 78%. The detection limit, defined as the minimum flux density for a source to be detected with 90% probability in a single observation, was in a range of 115-180 mJy depending on declination. However, some sources as weak as 70 mJy have been detected. Of 623 detected sources, 33 objects are detected for the first time in VLBI mode. We determined their coordinates with the median formal uncertainty 20 mas. The results of this work set the basis for future efforts to build the complete flux-limited sample of extragalactic sources at frequencies 22 GHz and higher at 3/4 of the celestial sphere.","The majority of baryons, which account for $15\%$ of the matter in the Universe, will end their lives as carbon and oxygen inside cold black dwarfs. Dark matter (DM) makes up the remaining $85\%$ of the matter in the universe, however, the fate of DM is unknown. Here we show that the destiny of purely gravitationally interacting DM particles follows one of two possible routes. The first possible route, the ""radiation-destiny"" scenario, is that massive DM particles lose sufficient energy through gravitational radiation causing them to spiral into a supermassive black hole that ultimately disappears through Hawking radiation. The second possible route, the ""drifting-alone"" destiny, applies to lighter DM particles, where only the central DM halo region spirals into the central BH which is then Hawking radiated away. The rest of the DM halo is ripped apart by the accelerated expansion of the Universe.",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"Instrumentation and methods for astrophysics focuses on detector and telescope design, experiment proposals.

The Dortmund Low Background Facility - Low-Background Gamma Ray Spectrometry with an Artificial Overburden,Positive pion absorption on 3He using modern trinucleon wave functions,False,"High-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors used for low-background gamma ray spectrometry are usually operated under either a fairly low overburden of the order of one meter of water equivalent (mw.e.) or a high overburden of the order of 100mw.e. or more, e.g. in specialized underground laboratories. The Dortmund Low Background Facility (DLB) combines the advantages of both approaches. The artificial overburden of 10mw.e. already shields the hadronic component of cosmic rays. The inner shielding, featuring a state-of-the-art neutron shielding and an active muon veto, enables low-background gamma ray spectrometry at an easy-accessible location at the campus of the Technische Universit\""at Dortmund.

Morphology and mechanical properties of nanocrystalline Cu/Ag alloy,Resonant metallic states in driven quasiperiodic lattices,False,"Hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to study the microstructures of nanocrystalline (nc) Cu/Ag alloys with various Ag concentrations. When the Ag concentration is below 50 Ag atoms/nm!, an increase in Ag concentration leads to a gradual growth of monolayer grain boundary (GB) complexions into nanolayer complexions. Above the concentration of 50 Ag atoms/nm!, wetting layers with a bulk crystalline phase are observed. The effects of Ag on mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of nc Cu/Ag alloys are investigated in MD simulations of uniaxial tension. GB sliding resistance is found to first increase and then decrease with an increase in Ag concentration. Surprisingly, we also find that the dislocation density decreases monotonically with an increase in Ag concentration, which suggests that the grain interiors are softened by the introduction of Ag dopants at GBs. In addition, there is a critical Ag concentration that maximizes flow stress of nc Cu/Ag alloys. The flow stress, GB sliding resistance, and the intragranular dislocation densities become less sensitive to Ag dopants when the grain diameter increases from 5nm to 40nm.","We consider a quasiperiodic Aubry-Andre (AA) model and add a weak time-periodic and spatially quasiperiodic perturbation. The undriven AA model is chosen to be well in the insulating regime. The spatial quasiperiodic perturbation extends the model into two dimensions in reciprocal space. For a spatial resonance which reduces the reciprocal space dynamics to an effective one-dimensional two-leg ladder case, the ac perturbation resonantly couples certain groups of localized eigenstates of the undriven AA model and turns them into extended metallic ones. Slight detuning of the spatial and temporal frequencies off resonance returns these states into localized ones. We analyze the details of the resonant metallic eigenstates using Floquet representations. In particular, we find that their size grows linearly with the system size.

Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition,The evidence of cosmic acceleration and observational constraints,False,"We present a new algorithm, named Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition (AGD), for automatically decomposing spectra into Gaussian components. AGD uses derivative spectroscopy and machine learning to provide optimized guesses for the number of Gaussian components in the data, and also their locations, widths, and amplitudes. We test AGD and find that it produces results comparable to human-derived solutions on 21cm absorption spectra from the 21cm SPectral line Observations of Neutral Gas with the EVLA (21-SPONGE) survey. We use AGD with Monte Carlo methods to derive the HI line completeness as a function of peak optical depth and velocity width for the 21-SPONGE data, and also show that the results of AGD are stable against varying observational noise intensity. The autonomy and computational efficiency of the method over traditional manual Gaussian fits allow for truly unbiased comparisons between observations and simulations, and for the ability to scale up and interpret the very large data volumes from the upcoming Square Kilometer Array and pathfinder telescopes.","Directly comparing the 6 expansion rate measured by type Ia supernovae data and the lower bound on the expansion rate set by the strong energy conditions or the null hypothesis that there never exists cosmic acceleration, we see $3\sigma$ direct evidence of cosmic acceleration and the $Rh=ct$ model is strongly excluded by the type Ia supernovae data. We also use Gaussian process method to reconstruct the expansion rate and the deceleration parameter from the 31 cosmic chronometers data and the 6 data points on the expansion rate measured from type Ia supernoave data, the direct evidence of cosmic acceleration is more than $3\sigma$ and we find that the transition redshift $z_t=0.60_{-0.12}^{+0.21}$ at which the expansion of the Universe underwent the transition from acceleration to deceleration. The Hubble constant inferred from the cosmic chronometers data with the Gaussian process method is $H_0=67.46\pm4.75$ Km/s/Mpc. To understand the properties of cosmic acceleration and dark energy, we fit two different two-parameter models to the observational data, and we find that the constraints on the model parameters from either the full distance modulus data by the Pantheon compilation or the compressed expansion rate data are very similar, and the derived Hubble constants are consistent with the Planck 2018 result. Our results confirm that the 6 compressed expansion rate data can replace the full 1048 distance modulus data from the Pantheon compilation. We derive the transition redshift $z_t=0.61_{-0.16}^{+0.24}$ by fitting a simple $q(z)$ model to the combination of cosmic chronometers data and the Pantheon compilation, the result is consistent with that obtained from the reconstruction with Gaussian process.

A number of microscopic calculations of nuclear electroweak structure and reactions have successfully explained the available experimental data, yielding a complex picture of the way nuclei interact with electroweak probes. This achievement is of great interest from the pure nuclear-physics point of view. But it is of much broader interest too, because the level of accuracy and confidence reached by these calculations opens up the concrete possibility of using nuclei to address open questions in other sub-fields of physics, such as, understanding the fundamental properties of neutrinos, or the particle nature of dark matter. In this talk, I will review recent progress in microscopic calculations of electroweak properties of light nuclei, including electromagnetic moments, form factors and transitions in between low-lying nuclear states along with preliminary studies for single- and double-beta decay rates.

Here we present the STAR measurements of elliptic flow $v_{2}$ and triangular flow $v_{3}$ of charged pions, along with $v_{2}$ of charged kaons and protons, as functions of $A_{\rm ch}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The slope parameters of $\Delta v_{2}$($A_{\rm ch}$) and $\Delta v_{3}$($A_{\rm ch}$) are reported and compared to investigate the LCC background. The similarity between pion and kaon slopes suggests that the hydrodynamics is not the dominant mechanism. The difference between the normalized $\Delta v_{2}$ and $\Delta v_{3}$ slopes, together with the small slopes in p+Au and d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV, suggest that the CMW picture remains a viable interpretation at RHIC.","QCD at the classical level possesses scale invariance which is broken by quantum effects. This ``dimensional transmutation'' phenomenon can be mathematically described by formulating classical gluodynamics in a curved, conformally flat, space-time with non-vanishing cosmological constant. We study QCD high-energy scattering in this theory. We find that the properties of the scattering amplitude at small momentum transfer are determined by the energy density of vacuum fluctuations. The approach gives rise to the power growth of the total hadron-hadron cross section with energy, i.e. the Pomeron. The intercept of the Pomeron and the multiplicity of produced particles are evaluated. We also speculate about a possible link between conformal anomaly and TeV scale quantum gravity.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Time Dependent Inelastic Emission and Capture of Localized Electrons in Si n-MOSFETs Under Microwave Irradiation,A topological method to characterize tapped granular media from the position of the particles,False,"Microwave irradiation causes voltage fluctuations in solid state nanodevices. Such an effect is relevant in atomic electronics and nanostructures for quantum information processing, where charge or spin states are controlled by microwave fields and electrically detected. Here the variation of the characteristic times of the multiphonon capture and emission of a single electron by an interface defect in submicron MOSFETs is calculated and measured as a function of the microwave power, whose frequency of the voltage modulation is assumed to be large if compared to the inverse of the characteristic times. The variation of the characteristic times under microwave irradiation is quantitatively predicted from the microwave frequency dependent stationary current generated by the voltage fluctuations itself. The expected values agree with the experimental measurements. The coupling between the microwave field and either one or two terminals of the device is discussed. Some consequences on nanoscale device technology are drawn.","We use the first Betti number of a complex to characterize the morphological structure of granular samples in mechanical equilibrium. We analyze two-dimensional granular packings after a tapping process by means of both simulations and experiments. States with equal packing fraction obtained with different tapping intensities are distinguished after the introduction of a filtration parameter which determines the particles (nodes in the network) that are joined by an edge. We first use numerical simulations to characterize the effect of the precision in the particles localization by artificially adding different levels of noise in this magnitude. The outcomes obtained for the simulations are then compared with the experimental results allowing a clear distinction of experimental packings that have the same density. This is accomplished by just using the position of the particles and no other information about the possible contacts, or magnitude of forces.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Light tunneling inhibition in longitudinally modulated Bragg-guiding arrays,Sub-diffusive behavior in the Standard Map,False,We consider waveguide array in which defect channels with reduced refractive index are spaced periodically and the light guiding is achieved due to Bragg reflection. We show that tunneling between defects can be inhibited using out-of-phase longitudinal modulation of refractive index exclusively in defect channels. Tunneling inhibition is almost perfect for strongly localized modes with propagation constants close to the gap center.,"In this work, we investigate the presence of sub-diffusive behavior in the Chirikov-Taylor Standard Map. We show that the stickiness phenomena, present in the mixed phase space of the map setup, can be characterized as a Continuous Time Random Walk model and connected to the theoretical background for anomalous diffusion. Additionally, we choose a variant of the Ulam method to numerically approximate the Perron-Frobenius operator for the map, allowing us to calculate the anomalous diffusion exponent via an eigenvalue problem, compared to the solution of the Fractional Diffusion Equation. The results here corroborate other findings in the literature of anomalous transport in Hamiltonian maps and can be suitable to describe transport properties of other dynamical systems.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Studies of parton distributions at a neutrino factory,Measurements of the ion fraction and mobility of alpha and beta decay products in liquid xenon using EXO-200,False,"The determination of parton distribution functions in the nucleon and nuclei is important for obtaining precise hadron-reaction cross sections, from which any new exotic signature could be found. We show that a future neutrino factory could provide important information on the parton distributions. First, a recent effort concerning the parametrization of nuclear parton distributions is explained. It suggests that the factory should be important for determining unknown behavior of valence-quark distributions in nuclei at small $x$. Second, the facility could be used for understanding nucleon spin structure and isospin violation in the parton distributions.","Alpha decays in the EXO-200 detector are used to measure the fraction of charged $^{218}\mathrm{Po}$ and $^{214}\mathrm{Bi}$ daughters created from alpha and beta decays, respectively. $^{222}\mathrm{Rn}$ alpha decays in liquid xenon (LXe) are found to produce $^{218}\mathrm{Po}^{+}$ ions $50.3 \pm 3.0\%$ of the time, while the remainder of the $^{218}\mathrm{Po}$ atoms are neutral. The fraction of $^{214}\mathrm{Bi}^{+}$ from $^{214}\mathrm{Pb}$ beta decays in LXe is found to be $76.4 \pm 5.7\%$, inferred from the relative rates of $^{218}\mathrm{Po}$ and $^{214}\mathrm{Po}$ alpha decays in the LXe. The average velocity of $^{218}\mathrm{Po}$ ions is observed to decrease for longer drift times. Initially the ions have a mobility of $0.390 \pm 0.006~\mathrm{cm}^2/(\mathrm{kV}~\mathrm{s})$, and at long drift times the mobility is $0.219 \pm 0.004~\mathrm{cm}^2/(\mathrm{kV}~\mathrm{s})$.

Infrared structure of $e^+e^- \to 3$ jets at NNLO: QED-type contributions,Multi-strange baryon production at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV,False,"The NNLO QCD corrections to the $e^+e^- \to 3$ jets can be decomposed according to their colour factors. Out of the seven colour factors, three are of QED-type: $1/N^2$, $N_F/N$ and $N_F^2$. We use the antenna subtraction method to compute these contributions, providing complete expressions for the subtraction terms in $N_F/N$ and $N_F^2$.","The production of ${\rm\Xi}^-$ and ${\rm\Omega}^-$ baryons and their anti-particles in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV has been measured using the ALICE detector. The transverse momentum spectra at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 0.5$) for charged $\rm\Xi$ and $\rm\Omega$ hyperons have been studied in the range $0.6 < p_{\rm T} < 8.0$ GeV/$c$ and $1.2 < p_{\rm T} < 7.0$ GeV/$c$, respectively, and in several centrality intervals (from the most central 0-10% to the most peripheral 60-80% collisions).

In particular, the Krak${\'o}$w and EPOS models give a satisfactory description of the data, with the latter covering a wider $p_{\rm T}$ range. Mid-rapidity yields, integrated over $p_{\rm T}$, have been determined. The hyperon-to-pion ratios are similar to those at RHIC: they rise smoothly with centrality up to $\langle N_{\rm part}\rangle$~150 and saturate thereafter.

"Glauber-model analysis of total reaction cross sections for Ne, Mg, Si, and S isotopes with Skyrme-Hartree-Fock densities",Shrunk halo and quenched shell gap at $N=16$ in $^{22}$C: Inversion of $sd$ states and deformation effects,False,"A systematic analysis is made on the total reaction cross sections for Ne, Mg, Si, and S isotopes. The high-energy nucleus-nucleus collision is described based on the Glauber model. Using the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method in the three-dimensional grid-space representation, we determine the nuclear density distribution for a wide range of nuclei self-consistently without assuming any spatial symmetry. The calculated total reaction cross sections consistently agree with the recent cross section data on Ne$+^{12}$C collision at 240$A$\,MeV, which makes it possible to discuss the radius and deformation of the isotopes. The total reaction cross sections for Mg$+^{12}$C, Si$+^{12}$C and S$+^{12}$C cases are predicted for future measurements. We also find that the high-energy cross section data for O, Ne, and Mg isotopes on a $^{12}$C target at around 1000\,$A$MeV can not be reproduced consistently with the corresponding data at 240\,$A$MeV.","We investigate the ground state properties of $^{22}$C by using a deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model in continuum and explore the interplays among the formation of a halo, deformation effects, the inversion of $sd$ states, the shell evolution, and changes of nuclear magicities. It is revealed that there is an inversion between the two spherical orbitals $2s_{1/2}$ and $1d_{5/2}$ in $^{22}$C compared with the conventional single particle shell structure in stable nuclei. This inversion, together with deformation effects, results in a shrunk halo and a quenched shell gap at $N=16$. It is predicted that the core of $^{22}$C is oblate but the halo is prolate. Therefore several exotic nuclear phenomena, including the halo, the shape decoupling effects, the inversion of $sd$ states, and the evolution of shell structure which results in (dis)appearance of magic numbers, coexist in one single nucleus $^{22}\mathrm{C}$.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

DOF phase separation of the Lennard-Jones fcc(111) surface,Magneto-transport and Berry phase in magnetically doped Bi$_{0.97-x}$Sb$_{0.03}$ single crystals,False,"Recent lattice model calculations have suggested that a full-layered crystal surface may undergo, under canonical (particle-conserving) conditions, a preroughening-driven two-dimensional phase separation into two disordered flat (DOF) regions, of opposite order parameter. We have carried out extensive classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the Lennard-Jones fcc(111) surface, to check whether these predictions are relevant or not for a realistic continuous system. Very long simulation times, a grid of temperatures from (2/3)Tm to Tm, and unusually large system sizes are employed to ensure full equilibrium and good statistics. By examining layer-by-layer occupancies, height fluctuations, sublattice order parameter and X-ray structure factors, we find a clear anomaly at ~0.83Tm. The anomaly is distinct from roughening (whose incipiency is also detected at ~0.94Tm), and is seen to be consistent with the preroughening plus phase separation scenario.","We report large magnetoresistance (MR) and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in single crystals of magnetically (M= Ni and Fe) doped M$_x$Bi$_{0.97-x}$Sb$_{0.03}$ ($x=$ 0, 0.02) topological insulators. The R$\bar{3}$m symmetry and phase have been confirmed by the Rietveld refinement of x-ray diffraction data. Interestingly, a magnetic field induced phase transition from semi-metallic to semi-conducting type is found with the energy gap around 80 meV at 15 Tesla in the $x=$ 0 sample. Moreover, we observe linear behavior of MR up to 15 Tesla in transverse mode and SdH oscillations in longitudinal mode where the field direction is with respect to the current and crystal plane. For the parent sample, we found the coherence length L$_\phi=$ 12.7 nm through the fitting of MR data in transverse mode with modified H-L-N equation. The extracted frequencies of SdH oscillations using the fast Fourier transform method and Landau level (LL) fan diagram are found to be consistent for the parent and Ni doped samples. The determined Fermi surface area is found to be slightly larger in Ni doped as compared to the parent sample possibly due to change in the Fermi energy. The Kohler's plot indicates a single scattering mechanism below 100 K. More importantly, the analysis with the help of LL fan diagram reveals the non-zero Berry phase $\phi_{\rm B}= -$(1$\pm$0.1)$\pi$, which demonstrates the non-trivial topological states near the Dirac point in the parent and Ni doped samples.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Whitham deformations partially saturating the modulational instability in the nonlinear Schrodinger equation,Conservation Laws of Variable Coefficient Diffusion-Convection Equations,False,In the framework of Gurevich and Pitaevskii approach [1] we construct modulated by Whitham [2] solution of nonlinear Shrodinger (NS) equation partially saturating the modulational instability. This solution describes new scenario of monochromatic wave evolution in NS equation which leads to generation of new phase and oscillation region.,"We study local conservation laws of variable coefficient diffusion-convection equations of the form $f(x)u_t=(g(x)A(u)u_x)_x+h(x)B(u)u_x$. The main tool of our investigation is the notion of equivalence of conservation laws with respect to the equivalence groups. That is why, for the class under consideration we first construct the usual equivalence group $G^{\sim}$ and the extended one $\hat G^{\sim}$ including transformations which are nonlocal with respect to arbitrary elements. The extended equivalence group $\hat G^{\sim}$ has interesting structure since it contains a non-trivial subgroup of gauge equivalence transformations. Then, using the most direct method, we carry out two classifications of local conservation laws up to equivalence relations generated by $G^{\sim}$ and $\hat G^{\sim}$, respectively. Equivalence with respect to $\hat G^{\sim}$ plays the major role for simple and clear formulation of the final results.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Comparison of RABITT and FROG measurements in the temporal characterization of attosecond pulse trains,Computing photoionization spectra in Gaussian basis sets,False,The attosecond high harmonic pulses obtained from a long Ar-filled gas cell were characterized by two techniques - the reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transition (RABITT) and frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) methods. The pulse durations obtained by RABITT and FROG methods agreed within 10 %.,We present a method to compute the photoionization spectra of atoms and molecules in linear response time-dependent density functional theory. The electronic orbital variations corresponding to ionized electrons are expanded on a basis set of delocalized functions obtained as the solution of the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation with gaussian basis set functions as right-hand side. The resulting scheme is able to reproduce photoionization spectra without any need for artificial regularization or localization.

Counterflow instability and turbulence in a spin-1 spinor Bose--Einstein condensate,Transport through periodically driven systems: Green's function approach formulated within frequency domain,False,"We theoretically study counterflow instability and turbulence in a spin-1 spinor Bose--Einstein condensate by the Gross--Pitaevskii equation and the Bogoliubov--de Gennes equation. Our study considers (i) the dynamics induced by the counterflow of two components with different magnetic quantum numbers, which leads to turbulence with spin degrees of freedom, and (ii) the properties of the turbulence. For (i), the behavior of the condensate induced by the counterflow strongly depends on whether the spin-dependent interaction is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic, leading to different behaviors for the dispersion relation and the spin density vector, $etc$. For (ii), we numerically calculate the spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction energy, which also depends on the spin-dependent interaction. The spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction energy in the ferromagnetic case exhibits a -7/3 power law, whereas that in the antiferromagnetic case does not. The -7/3 power law can be explained by scaling analysis.","The steady-state electronic transport across periodically driven systems can be efficiently addressed using Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker formalism. The time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function theory then may be adapted for developing direct and universal calculation schemes. Here we propose an alternative scheme to carry out the calculations. The idea is based on treating the transport problem in frequency domain and designing Green's functions for the corresponding Hamiltonians rewritten in Floquet-Sambe formalism. We show that within our approach the expressions for time-periodic currents and densities essentially replicate the well known formulas from time-independent theory. The results are then simplified for easier implementation in numeric computations.",Quantum Gases,"Quantum gases in condensed matter physics focuses on ultracold atomic and molecular gases, Bose-Einstein condensation, Feshbach resonances, spinor condensates, optical lattices, quantum simulation with cold atoms and molecules, and macroscopic interference phenomena."
Parametrization of the Charge-Carrier Mobility in Organic Disordered Semiconductors. APAE against EGDM,Experimental proof of a structural origin for the shadow Fermi surface in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$,False,"An appropriately parameterized compact analytical equation (APAE) is suggested to account for charge carrier mobility in organic disordered semiconductors (ODSs). This equation correctly reproduces the effects of temperature $T$, carrier concentration $n$, and electric field $F$ on the carrier mobility $\mu(T,F,n)$, as evidenced by comparison with analytical theories and Monte Carlo simulations. The set of material parameters responsible for charge transport is proven to be at varience to those used in the so-called extended Gaussian disorder model (EGDM) approach, which is widely exploited in commercially distributed device--simulation algorithms. While EGDM is only valid for cubic lattices with a specific choice of parameters, APAE describes charge transport in systems with spatial disorder in a wide range of parameters. APAE is user-friendly and, thus, suitable for incorporation into device-simulation algorithms.","By combining surprising new results from a full polarization analysis of nodal angle-resolved photoemission data from pristine and modulation-free Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ with structural information from LEED and {\it ab initio} one-step photoemission simulations, we prove that the shadow Fermi surface in these systems has structural origin, being due to orthorhombic distortions from tetragonal symmetry present in both surface and bulk.

Approaching the precursor nuclei of the third r-process peak with RIBs,Factorial cumulants from short-range correlations and global baryon number conservation,False,"The rapid neutron nucleosynthesis process involves an enormous amount of very exotic neutron-rich nuclei, which represent a theoretical and experimental challenge. Two of the main decay properties that affect the final abundance distribution the most are half-lives and neutron branching ratios. Using fragmentation of a primary $^{238}$U beam at GSI we were able to measure such properties for several neutron-rich nuclei from $^{208}$Hg to $^{218}$Pb. This contribution provides a short update on the status of the data analysis of this experiment, together with a compilation of the latest results published in this mass region, both experimental and theoretical. The impact of the uncertainties connected with the beta-decay rates and with beta-delayed neutron emission is illustrated on the basis of $r$-process network calculations. In order to obtain a reasonable reproduction of the third $r$-process peak, it is expected that both half-lives and neutron branching ratios are substantially smaller, than those based on FRDM+QRPA, commonly used in $r$-process model calculations. Further measurements around $N\sim126$ are required for a reliable modelling of the underlying nuclear structure, and for performing more realistic $r$-process abundance calculations.","We calculate the baryon factorial cumulants assuming arbitrary short-range correlations and the global baryon number conservation. The general factorial cumulant generating function is derived. Various relations between factorial cumulants subjected to baryon number conservation and the factorial cumulants without this constraint are presented. We observe that for $n$-th factorial cumulant, the short-range correlations of more than $n$ particles are suppressed with the increasing number of particles.

A chart for the energy levels of the square quantum well,Simulating the Coronal Evolution of AR 11437 using SDO/HMI Magnetograms,False,"A chart for the quantum mechanics of a particle of mass $m$ in a one-dimensional potential well of width $w$ and depth $V_0$ is derived. The chart is obtained by normalizing energy and potential through multiplication by ${8 m}{w^2} / h^2$, and gives directly the allowed couples (potential, energy), providing insights on the relation between the parameters and the number of allowed energy levels.","The coronal magnetic field evolution of AR 11437 is simulated by applying the magnetofrictional relaxation technique of Mackay et al. (2011). A sequence of photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms produced by SDO/HMI are used to drive the simulation and continuously evolve the coronal magnetic field of the active region through a series of non-linear force-free equilibria. The simulation is started during the first stages of the active region emergence so that its full evolution from emergence to decay can be simulated. A comparison of the simulation results with SDO/AIA observations show that many aspects of the active region's observed coronal evolution are reproduced. In particular, it shows the presence of a flux rope, which forms at the same location as sheared coronal loops in the observations. The observations show that eruptions occur on 2012 March 17 at 05:09 UT and 10:45 UT and on 2012 March 20 at 14:31 UT. The simulation reproduces the first and third eruption, with the simulated flux rope erupting roughly 1 and 10 hours before the observed ejections, respectively. A parameter study is conducted where the boundary and initial conditions are varied along with the physical effects of Ohmic diffusion, hyperdiffusion and an additional injection of helicity. When comparing the simulations, the evolution of the magnetic field, free magnetic energy, relative helicity and flux rope eruption timings do not change significantly. This indicates that the key element in reproducing the coronal evolution of AR 11437 is the use of line-of-sight magnetograms to drive the evolution of the coronal magnetic field.",General Physics,"General physics focuses on multidisciplinary topics, speculative ideas, and proposals that cover more than one area of physics.

F(T) gravity and k-essence,Interchange reconnection as the source of the fast solar wind within coronal holes,False,"Modified teleparallel gravity theory with the torsion scalar have recently gained a lot of attention as a possible explanation of dark energy. We perform a thorough reconstruction analysis on the so-called $F(T)$ models, where $F(T)$ is some general function of the torsion term, and derive conditions for the equivalence between of $F(T)$ models with purely kinetic k-essence. We present a new class models of $F(T)$-gravity and k-essence. We also proposed some new models of generalized gases and knot universes as well as some generalizations of $F(T)$ gravity.","The fast solar wind that fills the heliosphere originates from deep within regions of open magnetic field on the Sun called coronal holes. The energy source responsible for accelerating the plasma to high speeds is widely debated, however there is evidence that it is ultimately magnetic in nature with candidate mechanisms including wave heating^(1,2) and interchange reconnection^(3,4,5). The coronal magnetic field near the solar surface is structured on scales associated with supergranulation convection cells, where descending flows create intense fields. The energy density in these network magnetic field bundles is a likely candidate as an energy source of the wind. Here we report measurements of fast solar wind streams from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft^6 which provides strong evidence for the interchange reconnection mechanism. We show that supergranulation structure at the coronal hole base remains imprinted in the near-Sun solar wind resulting in asymmetric patches of magnetic 'switchbacks'^(7,8) and bursty wind streams with power law-like energetic ion spectra to beyond 100 keV. Computer simulations of interchange reconnection support key features of the observations, including the ion spectra. Important characteristics of interchange reconnection in the low corona are inferred from the data including that the reconnection is collisionless and that the energy release rate is sufficient to power the fast wind. In this scenario, open magnetic flux undergoes continuous reconnection and the wind is driven both by the resulting plasma pressure and the radial Alfvenic flow bursts.",General Physics,"General physics focuses on multidisciplinary topics, speculative ideas, and proposals that cover more than one area of physics.

Probing Dynamics at Interfaces: Molecular Motions in Lipid Bilayers studied by Neutron Backscattering,Towards the Probabilistic Earth-System Model,False,"Lipid membranes in a physiological context cannot be understood without taking into account their mobile environment. Here, we report on a high energy-resolution neutron backscattering study to investigate slow motions on nanosecond time scales in highly oriented solid supported phospholipid bilayers of the model system DMPC -d54 (deuterated 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phoshatidylcholine). This technique allows discriminating the Q-dependent onset of mobility and provides a benchmark test regarding the feasibility of dynamical neutron scattering investigations on these sample systems. Apart from freezing of the lipid acyl-chains, we could observe a second freezing temperature that we attribute to the hydration water in between the membrane stacks. The freezing is lowered several degrees as compared to (heavy) bulk water.","Multi-model ensembles provide a pragmatic approach to the representation of model uncertainty in climate prediction. However, such representations are inherently ad hoc, and, as shown, probability distributions of climate variables based on current-generation multi-model ensembles, are not accurate. Results from seasonal re-forecast studies suggest that climate model ensembles based on stochastic-dynamic parametrisation are beginning to outperform multi-model ensembles, and have the potential to become significantly more skilful than multi-model ensembles. The case is made for stochastic representations of model uncertainty in future-generation climate prediction models. Firstly, a guiding characteristic of the scientific method is an ability to characterise and predict uncertainty; individual climate models are not currently able to do this. Secondly, through the effects of noise-induced rectification, stochastic-dynamic parametrisation may provide a (poor man's) surrogate to high resolution. Thirdly, stochastic-dynamic parametrisations may be able to take advantage of the inherent stochasticity of electron flow through certain types of low-energy computer chips, currently under development.

The thickness of a liquid layer on the free surface of ice as obtained from computer simulation,Theory of radio-frequency spectroscopy of impurities in quantum gases,False,"Molecular dynamic simulations were performed for ice Ih with a free surface by using four water models, SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ice and TIP4P/2005. The behavior of the basal plane, the primary prismatic plane and of the secondary prismatic plane when exposed to vacuum was analyzed. We observe the formation of a thin liquid layer at the ice surface at temperatures below the melting point for all models and the three planes considered. For a given plane it was found that the thickness of a liquid layer was similar for different water models, when the comparison is made at the same undercooling with respect to the melting point of the model. The liquid layer thickness is found to increase with temperature. For a fixed temperature it was found that the thickness of the liquid layer decreases in the following order: the basal plane, the primary prismatic plane, and the secondary prismatic plane. For the TIP4P/Ice model, a model reproducing the experimental value of the melting temperature of ice, the first clear indication of the formation of a liquid layer appears at about -100 Celsius for the basal plane, at about -80 Celsius for the primary prismatic plane and at about -70 Celsius for the secondary prismatic plane.","We present a theory of radio-frequency spectroscopy of impurities interacting with a quantum gas at finite temperature. By working in the canonical ensemble of a single impurity, we show that the impurity spectral response is directly connected to the finite-temperature equation of state (free energy) of the impurity. We consider two different response protocols: ""injection"", where the impurity is introduced into the medium from an initially non-interacting state; and ""ejection"", where the impurity is ejected from an initially interacting state with the medium. We show that there is a simple mapping between injection and ejection spectra, which is connected to the detailed balance condition in thermal equilibrium. To illustrate the power of our approach, we specialize to the case of the Fermi polaron, corresponding to an impurity atom that is immersed in a non-interacting Fermi gas. For a mobile impurity with a mass equal to the fermion mass, we employ a finite-temperature variational approach to obtain the impurity spectral response. We find a striking non-monotonic dependence on temperature in the impurity free energy, the contact, and the radio-frequency spectra. For the case of an infinitely heavy Fermi polaron, we derive exact results for the finite-temperature free energy, thus generalizing Fumi's theorem to arbitrary temperature. We also determine the exact dynamics of the contact after a quench of the impurity-fermion interactions. Finally, we show that the injection and ejection spectra obtained from the variational approach compare well with the exact spectra, thus demonstrating the accuracy of our approximate method.",Other Condensed Matter,Other condensed matter in physics focuses on topics that fall outside the scope of more specific categories.
A $3 \times 3$ Lax Form for the $q$-Painlev\'e Equation of Type $E_6$,Modulational instability for nonlinear Schrodinger equations with a periodic potential,False,"For the $q$-Painlev\'e equation with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $E_6^{(1)}$, a $2\times 2$ matrix Lax form and a second order scalar lax form were known. We give a new $3\times 3$ matrix Lax form and a third order scalar equation related to it. Continuous limit is also discussed.","We study the stability properties of periodic solutions to the Nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation with a periodic potential. We exploit the symmetries of the problem, in particular the Hamiltonian structure and the $\U(1)$ symmetry. We develop a simple sufficient criterion that guarantees the existence of a modulational instability spectrum along the imaginary axis. In the case of small amplitude solutions that bifurcate from the band edges of the linear problem this criterion becomes especially simple. We find that the small amplitude solutions corresponding to the band edges alternate stability, with the first band edge being modulationally unstable in the focusing case, the second band edge being modulationally unstable in the defocusing case, and so on. This small amplitude result has a nice physical interpretation in terms of the effective mass of a particle in the periodic potential. We also consider, in somewhat less detail, some sideband instabilities in the small amplitude limit. We find that, depending on the Krein signature of the collision, these can be of one of two types. Finally we illustrate this with some exact calculations in the case where $V(x)$ is an elliptic function, where all of the relevant calculations can be done explicitly.",Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems,"Exactly solvable and integrable systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that can be solved exactly through analytical methods or have properties that allow for integrability.

The physical basis of self-organization of the mammalian oocyte spindle,Global Earthquake Prediction Systems,False,"To prepare gametes with the appropriate number of chromosomes, mammalian oocytes undergo two sequential cell divisions. During each division, a large, long-lived, microtubule-based organelle called the meiotic spindle assembles around condensed chromosomes. Although meiotic spindles have been intensively studied for several decades, as force-generating mechanical objects, they remain very poorly understood. In materials physics, coarse-grained theories have been essential in understanding the large-scale behavior of systems composed of many interacting particles. It is unclear, however, if this approach can succeed in capturing the properties of active, biochemically complex, living materials like the spindle. Here, we show that a class of models based on nematic liquid crystal theory can describe important aspects of the organelle-scale structure and dynamics of spindles in living mouse oocytes. Using our models to interpret quantitative polarization microscopy data, we measure for the first time material properties relating to stress propagation in living oocytes, including the nematic diffusivities corresponding to splay and bend deformations. Unlike the reconstituted amphibian spindles that were previously studied in vitro, nematic elastic stress is exponentially screened in the microtubule network of living mammalian oocytes, with a screening length of order one micron. This observation can be explained by the relatively high volume fraction of embedded chromosomes in mammalian meiotic spindles, which cause long voids in the microtubule network and so disrupt orientational stress propagation.","Terra Seismic can predict most major earthquakes (M6.2 or greater) at least 2 - 5 months before they will strike. Global earthquake prediction is based on determinations of the stressed areas that will start to behave abnormally before major earthquakes. The size of the observed stressed areas roughly corresponds to estimates calculated from Dobrovolskys formula. To identify abnormalities and make predictions, Terra Seismic applies various methodologies, including satellite remote sensing methods and data from ground-based instruments. We currently process terabytes of information daily, and use more than 80 different multiparameter prediction systems. Alerts are issued if the abnormalities are confirmed by at least five different systems. We observed that geophysical patterns of earthquake development and stress accumulation are generally the same for all key seismic regions. Thus, the same earthquake prediction methodologies and systems can be applied successfully worldwide.

Polarimetric observation of noise of linear birefringence of cesium atomic vapors spectrally localized at double Larmor frequency in a magnetic field,Empirical Validation of a Thermal Model of a Complex Roof Including Phase Change Materials,False,"We study radio-frequency spectrum of ellipticity noise of a probe laser beam transmitted through a cell with cesium vapor in a magnetic field. The experimental results are interpreted in terms of the model proposed by Gorbovitskii and Perel (Opt. Spektrosc. 54, 388 (1983)) according to which the observed noise arises due to heterodyning of the light scattered by fluctuations of the tensor $ \alpha $ of optical susceptibility of cesium vapor. We show, both experimentally and theoretically, that, in the noise measurements if this kind, along with fluctuations of the antisymmetric (gyrotropic) part of the tensor $ \alpha $ at the Larmor frequency, may be observed fluctuations of its symmetric part, corresponding to fluctuations of linear birefringence (alignment) of the atomic system. The polarization noise provided by these fluctuations is localized spectrally at the double Larmor frequency.","This paper deals with the empirical validation of a building thermal model using a phase change material (PCM) in a complex roof. A mathematical model dedicated to phase change materials based on the heat apparent capacity method was implemented in a multi-zone building simulation code, the aim being to increase understanding of the thermal behavior of the whole building with PCM technologies. To empirically validate the model, the methodology is based both on numerical and experimental studies. A parametric sensitivity analysis was performed and a set of parameters of the thermal model have been identified for optimization. The use of a generic optimization program called GenOpt coupled to the building simulation code enabled to determine the set of adequate parameters. We first present the empirical validation methodology and main results of previous work. We then give an overview of GenOpt and its coupling with the building simulation code. Finally, once the optimization results are obtained, comparisons of thermal model of PCM with measurements are found to be acceptable and are presented.",Atomic Physics,"Atomic physics focuses on atomic and molecular structure, spectra, collisions, and data.

Persistent spin helix in Rashba-Dresselhaus two-dimensional electron systems,Unveiling the Structural Origin of the High Carrier Mobility of a Molecular Monolayer on Boron Nitride,False,"A persistent spin helix (PSH) in spin-orbit-coupled two-dimensional electron systems was recently predicted to exist in two cases: [001] quantum wells (QWs) with equal coupling strengths of the Rashba and the Dresselhaus interactions (RD), and Dresselhaus-only [110] QWs. Here we present supporting results and further investigations, using our previous results [Phys. Rev. B 72, 153305 (2005)]. Refined PSH patterns for both RD [001] and Dresselhaus [110] QWs are shown, such that the feature of the helix is clearly seen. We also discuss the time dependence of spin to reexamine the origin of the predicted persistence of the PSH. For the RD [001] case, we further take into account the random Rashba effect, which is much more realistic than the constant Rashba model. The distorted PSH pattern thus obtained suggests that such a PSH may be more observable in the Dresselhaus [110] QWs, if the dopants cannot be regularly enough distributed.","Very recently, it was demonstrated that the carrier mobility of a molecular monolayer dioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene (C8-BTBT) on boron nitride can reach 10 cm2/Vs, the highest among the previously reported monolayer molecular field-effect transistors. Here we show that the high-quality single crystal of the C8-BTBT monolayer may be the key origin of the record-high carrier mobility. We discover that the C8-BTBT molecules prefer layer-by-layer growth on both hexagonal boron nitride and graphene. The flatness of these substrates substantially decreases the C8-BTBT nucleation density and enables repeatable growth of large-area single crystal of the C8-BTBT monolayer. Our experimental result indicates that only out-of-plane roughness greater than 0.6 nm of the substrates could induce disturbance in the crystal growth and consequently affect the charge transport. This information would be important in guiding the growth of high-quality epitaxy molecular film.",Other Condensed Matter,Other condensed matter in physics focuses on topics that fall outside the scope of more specific categories.
A cornucopia of antineutrons and hyperons from super J/psi factory for next-generation nuclear and particle physics high-precision experiments,On early onset of quark number density at zero temperature,False,"In order to study the interactions and structure of various types of matter one typically needs to carry out scattering experiments utilizing many different particles as projectiles. Whereas beams of $e^\pm$, $\mu^\pm$, $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, proton, antiproton, and of various heavy ions have been produced and have enabled many scientific breakthroughs, beams of antineutrons, hyperons ($\Lambda$, $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$) and their antiparticles are typically not easy to obtain. Here we point out and investigate a new high-quality source of these particles: a super $J/\psi$ factory with capability of accumulating trillions of $J/\psi$ decays each year. In the relevant $J/\psi$ decays the desired particle is produced together with other final state particles that can be tagged. This allows accurate determination of the flux and momentum of the projectile, enabling unprecedented precision-study of the corresponding interactions with a broad range of targets. These novel high-statistics sources of baryons and antibaryons with precisely known kinematics open fresh opportunities for applications in particle and nuclear physics, including antinucleon-nucleon interaction, nonvalence $s\bar{s}$ component of the nucleon, (anti)hyperon-nucleon interaction, OZI violation, (multi-strange) hypernuclei, exotic light hadron spectroscopy and many others, as well as calibration of Monte Carlo simulation for hadronic and medical physics.","We study a longstanding problem in lattice QCD at low temperature and nonzero quark chemical potential on an onset of the quark number density at $\mu=m_\pi/2$. We introduce a physical parametrization of the eigenvalues in the reduction formula of the fermion determinant. It is shown that the parametrization reduces the quark number density operator to an expression with the Fermi distribution of the quark. For each configuration, the eigenvalues of the reduced matrix correspond to one-particle energy states of a quark. The gap of the eigenspectrum of the reduced matrix corresponds to the gap of the energy states, which causes the $\mu$-independence of the fermion determinant for small $\mu$ at T=0. Once $\mu$ exceeds the gap, the quark number density becomes nonzero for each configuration, which causes the early onset of the quark number density.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Distribution of captured planetesimals in circumplanetary gas disks and implications for accretion of regular satellites,The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. XXXIV. Ultra-Compact Dwarf (UCD) Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster,False,"Regular satellites of giant planets are formed by accretion of solid bodies in circumplanetary disks. Planetesimals that are moving on heliocentric orbits and are sufficiently large to be decoupled from the flow of the protoplanetary gas disk can be captured by gas drag from the circumplanetary disk. In the present work, we examine the distribution of captured planetesimals in circumplanetary disks using orbital integrations. We find that the number of captured planetesimals reaches an equilibrium state as a balance between continuous capture and orbital decay into the planet. The number of planetesimals captured into retrograde orbits is much smaller than those on prograde orbits, because the former ones experience strong headwind and spiral into the planet rapidly. We find that the surface number density of planetesimals at the current radial location of regular satellites can be significantly enhanced by gas drag capture, depending on the velocity dispersions of planetesimals and the width of the gap in the protoplanetary disk. Using a simple model, we also examine the ratio of the surface densities of dust and captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk, and find that solid material at the current location of regular satellites can be dominated by captured planetesimals when the velocity dispersion of planetesimals is rather small and a wide gap is not formed in the protoplanetary disk. In this case, captured planetesimals in such a region can grow by mutual collision before spiraling into the planet, and would contribute to the growth of regular satellites.","We present a study of ultra compact dwarf (UCD) galaxies in the Virgo cluster based mainly on imaging from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). Using $\sim$100 deg$^{2}$ of $u^*giz$ imaging, we have identified more than 600 candidate UCDs, from the core of Virgo out to its virial radius. Candidates have been selected through a combination of magnitudes, ellipticities, colors, surface brightnesses, half-light radii and, when available, radial velocities. Candidates were also visually validated from deep NGVS images. Subsamples of varying completeness and purity have been defined to explore the properties of UCDs and compare to those of globular clusters and the nuclei of dwarf galaxies with the aim of delineating the nature and origins of UCDs. From a surface density map, we find the UCDs to be mostly concentrated within Virgo's main subclusters, around its brightest galaxies. We identify several subsamples of UCDs -- i.e., the brightest, largest, and those with the most pronounced and/or asymmetric envelopes -- that could hold clues to the origin of UCDs and possible evolutionary links with dwarf nuclei. We find some evidence for such a connection from the existence of diffuse envelopes around some UCDs, and comparisons of radial distributions of UCDs and nucleated galaxies within the cluster.",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics,"Earth and planetary astrophysics focuses on interplanetary medium, planetary physics, planetary astrobiology, extrasolar planets, comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

Applying Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process Regression to Computational Fluid Dynamics Problems,Cosmic-muon characterization and annual modulation measurement with Double Chooz detectors,False,"Bayesian optimization (BO) based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) is applied to different CFD (computational fluid dynamics) problems which can be of practical relevance. The problems are i) shape optimization in a lid-driven cavity to minimize or maximize the energy dissipation, ii) shape optimization of the wall of a channel flow in order to obtain a desired pressure-gradient distribution along the edge of the turbulent boundary layer formed on the other wall, and finally, iii) optimization of the controlling parameters of a spoiler-ice model to attain the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil with an actual surface ice. The diversity of the optimization problems, independence of the optimization approach from any adjoint information, the ease of employing different CFD solvers in the optimization loop, and more importantly, the relatively small number of the required flow simulations reveal the flexibility, efficiency, and versatility of the BO-GPR approach in CFD applications. It is shown that to ensure finding the global optimum of the design parameters of the size up to 8, less than 90 executions of the CFD solvers are needed. Furthermore, it is observed that the number of flow simulations does not significantly increase with the number of design parameters. The associated computational cost of these simulations can be affordable for many optimization cases with practical relevance.","A study on cosmic muons has been performed for the two identical near and far neutrino detectors of the Double Chooz experiment, placed at $\sim$120 and $\sim$300 m.w.e. underground respectively, including the corresponding simulations using the MUSIC simulation package. This characterization has allowed to measure the muon flux reaching both detectors to be (3.64 $\pm$ 0.04) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for the near detector and (7.00 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for the far one. The seasonal modulation of the signal has also been studied observing a positive correlation with the atmospheric temperature, leading to an effective temperature coefficient of $\alpha_{T}$ = 0.212 $\pm$ 0.024 and 0.355 $\pm$ 0.019 for the near and far detectors respectively.

Inferring the Solar Meridional Circulation Flow Profile by Applying Bayesian Methods to Time-distance Helioseismology,Model of horizontal stress in the Aigion10 well (Corinth) calculated from acoustic body waves,False,"Mapping the large-scale subsurface plasma flow profile within the Sun has been attempted using various methods for several decades. One such flow in particular is the meridional circulation, for which numerous studies have been published. However, such studies often show disagreement in structure. In an effort to constrain the flow profile from the data, a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo framework has been developed to take advantage of the advances in computing power that allow for the efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces. This study utilizes helioseismic travel-time difference data covering a span of twenty-one years and a parametrized model of the meridional circulation to find the most likely flow profiles. Tests were carried out on artificial data to determine the ability of this method to recover expected solar-like flow profiles as well as a few extreme cases. We find the method capable of recovering the input flows of both single- and double-cell flow structures. Some inversion results indicate potential differences in meridional circulation between the two solar cycles in terms of both magnitude and morphology, in particular in the mid convection zone. Of these, the most likely solutions show that solar cycle 23 has a large, single-celled profile, while cycle 24 shows weaker flows in general and hints towards a double-celled structure.","In this paper we try to deduce the in situ stresses from the monopole acoustic waves of the well AIG10 between 689 and 1004 meters in depth (Corinth Golf). This borehole crosses competent sedimentary formations (mainly limestone), and the active Aigion fault between 769 and 780 meters in depth. This study is the application of two methods previously described by the author who shows the relationships between in situ horizontal stresses, and (i) the presence or absence of double body waves, (ii) the amplitude ratios between S and P waves (Rousseau, 2005a,b). The full waveforms of this well exhibit two distinct domains separated by the Aigion fault. Within the upper area the three typical waves (P, S and Stoneley) may appear, but the S waves are not numerous, and there is no double body wave, whereas within the lower area there are sometimes double P waves, but no S waves. From those observations, we conclude that the stress domain is isotropic above the Aigion fault, and anisotropic below, which is consistent with conclusions drawn by authors from other kinds of data. The calculation applied to the characteristics of the double P waves suggests that this horizontal stress anisotropy is very high, up to 190 % with the maximum horizontal stress superior to 100 MPa and the minimum horizontal stress close to zero at 939 meters in depth. The amplitude ratios between the S and P wave indicate a very strong compression - which is isotropic - above the Aigion fault.",Space Physics,"Space physics focuses on space plasma physics.

Granular Impact Model as an Energy-Depth Relation,Impact of the crystal electric field on magnetocaloric properties of CsGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$,False,"Velocity-squared drag forces are common in describing an object moving through a granular material. The resulting force law is a nonlinear differential equation, and closed-form solutions of the dynamics are typically obtained by making simplifying assumptions. Here, we consider a generalized version of such a force law which has been used in many studies of granular impact. We show that recasting the force law into an equation for the kinetic energy versus depth, K(z), yields a linear differential equation, and thus general closed-form solutions for the velocity versus depth. This approach also has several advantages in fitting such models to experimental data, which we demonstrate by applying it to data from 2D impact experiments. We also present new experimental results for this model, including shape and depth dependence of the velocity-squared drag force.","Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) was investigated in the single crystal of CsGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ in the temperature range from 2 to 30 K and fields up to 5 T applied along the easy and hard magnetic axis. The analysis of specific heat and magnetization provided the refinement of crystal electric field (CEF) parameters supporting the dominance of uniaxial symmetry. The knowledge of CEF energy levels enabled the extrapolation of MCE parameters outside the experimental region. Consequently, maximum values of the isothermal entropy change, $-\Delta S_{\rm M}$, in magnetic fields up to 5 T are expected to occur at temperatures between 1 and 2 K. While $-\Delta S_{\rm M}$ achieves 19.2 J/kgK already for the field 1 T, for the field change 7 T, maximal $-\Delta S_{\rm M}$ $\approx$ 26.8 J/kgK with a refrigerant capacity of 215 J/kg is expected. The absence of thermal hysteresis and the losses due to eddy currents as well as good chemical stability makes the compound CsGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ attractive for magnetic refrigeration at low temperatures. The possibilities of further enhancement of MCE parameters are discussed.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Spatial fluctuations of the intergalactic temperature-density relation after hydrogen reionization,Surface brightness discontinuities in radio halos. Insights from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey,False,"The thermal state of the post-reionization IGM is sensitive to the timing of reionization and the nature of the ionizing sources. We have modelled here the thermal state of the IGM in cosmological radiative transfer simulations of a realistic, extended, spatially inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization process, carefully calibrated with Ly-alpha forest data. We compare these with cosmological simulations run using a spatially homogeneous ionizing background. The simulations with a realistic growth of ionized regions and a realistic spread in reionization redshifts show, as expected, significant spatial fluctuations in the temperature-density relation (TDR) of the post-reionization IGM. The most recently ionized regions are hottest and exhibit a flatter TDR. In simulations consistent with the average TDR inferred from Ly-alpha forest data, these spatial fluctuations have a moderate but noticeable effect on the statistical properties of the Ly-alpha opacity of the IGM at z ~ 4-6. This should be taken into account in accurate measurements of the thermal properties of the IGM and the free-streaming of dark matter from Ly-alpha forest data in this redshift range. The spatial variations of the TDR predicted by our simulations are, however, smaller by about a factor two than would be necessary to explain the observed large spatial opacity fluctuations on large (> 50 comoving Mpc/h) scales at z > 5.5.","Dynamical motions in the ICM can imprint distinctive features on X-ray images that map the thermal emission from galaxy clusters, such as sharp surface brightness discontinuities due to shocks and cold fronts. The gas dynamics during cluster mergers may also drive large-scale turbulence in the ICM, which in turn generates extended synchrontron sources known as radio halos. Surface brightness edges have been found numerous times in the thermal gas of clusters based on X-ray observations. In contrast, edges in radio halos have only been observed in a handful of cases. Our goal is to search for new radio surface brightness discontinuities in the ICM. We inspected the images of the Bullet Cluster and the other 25 radio halos reported in the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey. To aid the identification of surface brightness discontinuities, we applied a gradient-filtering edge-detection method to the radio images. We find that the adopted filtering technique is helpful in identifying surface brightness edges in radio images, allowing us to identify at least one gradient in half of the radio halos studied. For the Bullet Cluster, we find excellent agreement between the locations of the 4 radio discontinuities detected and the X-ray edges. This similarity informs us that there is substantial interplay between thermal and nonthermal components in galaxy clusters. This interplay is likely due to the frozen-in ICM magnetic field, which mediates the advection of cosmic rays while being dragged by thermal gas flows. We conclude that radio halos are shaped by dynamical motions in the ICM and that they often display surface brightness discontinuities, which appear to be co-located with edges in the thermal gas emission.

A comparison of the 3d and 4d data for the propagators suggests that dimensional reduction works surprisingly well down to temperatures T=2 T_c.

Data driven optimal filtering for phase and frequency of noisy oscillations: application to vortex flowmetering,A revisit of symmetry analysis and group classifications of Boiti Leon Pempinelli system in (2+1)-dimensions,False,"A new method for extracting the phase of oscillations from noisy time series is proposed. To obtain the phase, the signal is filtered in such a way that the filter output has minimal relative variation in the amplitude (MIRVA) over all filters with complex-valued impulse response. The argument of the filter output yields the phase. Implementation of the algorithm and interpretation of the result are discussed.

In order to do this, they reduced the system down to a 2-dimensional axisymmetric Hamiltonian system. Now this is known as the H\'enon-Heiles (HH) System. Due to its apparent simplicity but extremely complicated dynamical behavior, this system is currently a paradigm in dynamical systems. In this paper, we perform a series expansion up to the seventh order of a potential with axial and reflection symmetries. After some transformations, this turns into the generalized H\'enon-Heiles (GHH) system where we separate the fifth and seventh-order terms. We qualitatively analyze this system for energies near the threshold between bounded and unbounded motion with Poincar\'e sections and quantitatively analyze with Lyapunov Exponents. We find that particles far from the critical energy demonstrate less chaos. Additionally, the fifth-order term creates more regularity while the seventh-order term does the opposite.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Multi-step Steady-State Measurements of Low Permeability Using Series Circuit with A Reference Rock Sample,Modeling of Atmospheric Flow Around a Coastal Cape: Lee Side Story,False,"A multi-step steady-state (MSSS) method is proposed here for the measurement of low permeability. This new method can accurately and easily measure very low permeabilities of rock samples using a new setup, where the targeted rock sample and ordinary apparatus components are connected with a reference rock sample to form a series circuit. Any conventional rock sample with high permeability could be used as a reference rock sample such that the traditional steady-state measurement is feasible to accurately determine its permeability as a reference value in the MSSS method. The challenging measurement of tiny mass flux rate by advanced pump system is avoided and the permeability of targeted rock sample can be directly computed using the pressure drops, sectional areas and lengths of the two connected rock samples, and the known permeability of the reference rock sample, based on the mass conservation principle in a series circuit at steady state. Multi-step measurements using additional reference rock samples will be needed if the pressure drop across the first reference rock sample is too small to be accurately measured due to high permeability ratio when it is connected with the targeted rock sample to form a series circuit. The relative pressure drops can be small since the measurement of flow speed is unnecessary, which improves the accuracy in studying the dependence of gas permeability on the pore pressure. Consequently, the advantages of the MSSS method include low expense, simplicity, high accuracy and efficiency.","The current research focuses on mesoscale dynamics of the atmospheric circulation around an idealized coastal cape representing typical summertime circulation along the northwest coast of the U.S., studied using a mesoscale coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling system. The orographic wind maximum features a strong NW flow extending a few hundred kilometers downstream and seaward of the cape, which closely follows mesoscale orographic low pressure developed in the lee of the cape. Both wind maximum and the lee trough experience a pronounced diurnal cycle, marked by maximum northwest flow and minimum pressure in the local evening hours (its opposite phase during morning hours), and confirmed by observations from limited buoy and coastal stations. Vertical structure of the atmospheric boundary layer over the coastal ocean on the lee side of the cape indicated the downward propagation of potential temperature and wind features during the course of the day, as opposed to the traditional surface-driven development of the atmospheric boundary layer. Momentum analysis showed the local pressure gradients near the surface vary greatly depending on the relative location about the cape. Strong perturbations in relative vorticity downwind of the cape supported the hypothesis that mountain dynamics have a key role in establishing wind regime around the cape. The sensitivity studies indicated the importance of coastal terrain elevation on the formation and the strength of the lee trough and wind maximum. Higher coastal topography was found to cause greater separation of the upwelling front (jet) from the coast downwind of the cape.",Geophysics,Geophysics focuses on atmospheric physics.

Modeling continuum polarization levels of tidal disruption events based on the collision-induced outflow mode,DRAGONS -- A Quick Overview,False,"TDEs have been observed in the optical and UV for more than a decade but the underlying emission mechanism still remains a puzzle. It has been suggested that viewing angle effects could potentially explain their large photometric and spectroscopic diversity. Polarization is indeed sensitive to the viewing angle and the first polarimetry studies of TDEs are now available, calling for a theoretical interpretation. In this study, we model the continuum polarization levels of TDEs using the radiative transfer code POSSIS and the collision-induced outflow (CIO) TDE emission scenario where unbound shocked gas originating from a debris stream intersection point offset from the black hole, reprocesses the hard emission from the accretion flow into UV and optical bands. We explore two different cases of peak mass fallback rates M'p (~3 and ~0.3 Msol/yr) while varying the following geometrical parameters: the distance R_int from the black hole (BH) to the intersection point, the radius of the photosphere around the BH R_ph, on the surface of which the photons are generated, and the opening angle Deltheta (anisotropic emission). For the high mass fallback rate case, we find for every viewing angle polarization levels below one (P<1%) and P<0.5% for 10/12 simulations. The absolute value of polarization reaches its maximum (P_max) for equatorial viewing angles. For the low mass fallback rate case, the maximum value predicted is P~8.8% and P_max is reached for intermediate viewing angles. We find that the polarization depends strongly on i) the optical depths at the central regions set by the different M'p values and ii) the viewing angle. Finally, by comparing our model predictions to polarization observations of a few TDEs, we attempt to constrain their observed viewing angles and we show that multi-epoch polarimetric observations can become a key factor in constraining the viewing angle of TDEs.","DRAGONS (Data Reduction for Astronomy from Gemini Observatory North and South) is a platform for the reduction and processing of astronomical data.

Complexity at Mesoscale,On the Deformations of Dorfman's and Sokolov's Operators,False,"Through three examples we illustrate some of the concepts and ingredients required for pattern formation at mesoscopic scales. Two examples build on microscopic models where mesoscopic patterns emerge from homogeneous ground states driven into instability by external forcing. In contrast, the third example builds on a mesoscopic phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau type model of solid-solid structural phase transitions.

"Polarimetry in M\""ossbauer spectroscopy with Synchrotron M\""ossbauer Source",Nucleation of a three-state spin model on complex networks,False,"We have tested the new experimental techniques in the M\""ossbauer spectroscopy with Synchrotron M\""ossbauer Source by using the polarization analysis of the reflected radiation. In particular we have shown that the dichroic components in M\""ossbauer spectra create the scattering intensity with ""rotated"" polarization. The angular dependence for such component in the reflected signal is characterized by the peak near the critical angle of the total external reflection, and in the case of the collinear antiferromagnetic interlayer ordering the ""magnetic"" maxima on the reflectivity curve are formed mainly by this ""rotated"" polarization. The first experiment on M\""ossbauer reflectivity with selection of the ""rotated"" polarization shows the expected peak near the critical angle. The measured M\""ossbauer reflectivity spectra of the ""rotated"" polarization near the critical angle are rather different from the M\""ossbauer reflectivity spectra, measured without polarization analysis. They contain a smaller number of lines and can simplify the interpretation of the poorly resolved spectra. The enhanced surface sensitivity of the new technique is discussed.","We study the metastability and nucleation of the Blume-Capel model on complex networks, in which each node can take one of three possible spin variables $\left\{ {-1, 0, 1} \right\}$. We consider the external magnetic field $h$ to be positive, and let the chemical potential $\lambda$ vary between $-h$ and $h$ in a low temperature, such that the $1$ configuration is stable, and $-1$ configuration and/or $0$ configuration are metastable. Combining the heterogeneous mean-field theory with simulations, we show that there exist four regions with distinct nucleation scenarios depending on the values of $h$ and $\lambda$: the system undergoes a two-step nucleation process from $-1$ configuration to $0$ configuration and then to $1$ configuration (region I); nucleation becomes a one-step process without an intermediate metastable configuration directly from $-1$ configuration to $1$ configuration (region II(1)) or directly from $0$ configuration to $1$ configuration (region II(2)) depending on the sign of $\lambda$; the metastability of the system vanishes and nucleation is thus irrelevant (region III). Furthermore, we show that in the region I nucleation rates for each step intersect that results in the occurrence of a maximum in the total nucleation rate.",Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics,"Mesoscale and nanoscale physics in condensed matter physics focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of systems with dimensions at the mesoscopic scale (intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic scales) and the nanoscale (typically less than 100 nanometers).

Double Helicity Asymmetry in $\pi^{0}$ Production at Midrapidity in Polarized $p+p$ Collisions at $\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV,Three-Body Unitary Coupled-Channel Analysis on $\eta(1405/1475)$,False,"PHENIX measurements are presented for the cross-section and double-helicity asymmetry ($A_{LL}$) of inclusive $\pi^{0}$ production ($A_{LL}^{\pi^{0}}$) at midrapidity from $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV from data taken in 2012 and 2013 at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculation agrees excellently with the presented cross-section result. The $A_{LL}^{\pi^{0}}$ follows an increasingly positive asymmetry as functions of $p_{T}$ and $\sqrt{s}$ at the fixed $x_{T}$. The latest global analysis results, which support the positive spin contribution of gluon ($\Delta{}G$), agrees excellently with the presented asymmetry result. The asymmetry result extends the experimental sensitivity to the previously unexplored $x$ region down to $x\sim0.01$ and provides additional constraints on $\Delta{}G$.","The recent BESIII data on $J/\psi\to\gamma(K_SK_S\pi^0)$, which is significantly more precise than earlier $\eta(1405/1475)$-related data, enables quantitative discussions on $\eta(1405/1475)$ at the previously unreachable level. We conduct a three-body unitary coupled-channel analysis of experimental Monte-Carlo outputs for radiative $J/\psi$ decays via $\eta(1405/1475)$: $K_SK_S\pi^0$ Dalitz plot distributions from the BESIII, and branching ratios of $\gamma(\eta\pi^+\pi^-)$ and $\gamma(\gamma\pi^+\pi^-)$ final states relative to that of $\gamma(K\bar{K}\pi)$. Our model systematically considers (multi-)loop diagrams and an associated triangle singularity, which is critical in making excellent predictions on $\eta(1405/1475)\to \pi\pi\pi$ lineshapes and branching ratios. The $\eta(1405/1475)$ pole locations are revealed for the first time. Two poles for $\eta(1405)$ are found on different Riemann sheets of the $K^*\bar{K}$ channel, while one pole for $\eta(1475)$. The $\eta(1405/1475)$ states are described with two bare states dressed by continuum states. The lower bare state would be an excited $\eta^\prime$, while the higher one could be an excited $\eta^{(\prime)}$, hybrid, glueball, or their mixture.

Point-Form Hamiltonian Dynamics and Applications,Third moments of conserved charges as probes of QCD phase structure,False,This short review summarizes recent developments and results in connection with point-form dynamics of relativistic quantum systems. We discuss a Poincare invariant multichannel formalism which describes particle production and annihilation via vertex interactions that are derived from field theoretical interaction densities. We sketch how this rather general formalism can be used to derive electromagnetic form factors of confined quark-antiquark systems. As a further application it is explained how the chiral constituent quark model leads to hadronic states that can be considered as bare hadrons dressed by meson loops. Within this approach hadron resonances acquire a finite (non-perturbative) decay width. We will also discuss the point-form dynamics of quantum fields. After recalling basic facts of the free-field case we will address some quantum field theoretical problems for which canonical quantization on a space-time hyperboloid could be advantageous.,"The third moments of conserved charges, the baryon and electric charge numbers, and energy, as well as their mixed moments, carry more information on the state around the QCD phase boundary than previously proposed fluctuation observables and higher order moments.

On the origin of elemental abundances in the terrestrial planets,Deep Radio Interferometric Imaging with POLISH: DSA-2000 and weak lensing,False,"The abundances of elements in the Earth and the terrestrial planets provide the initial conditions for life and clues as to the history and formation of the Solar System. We follow the pioneering work of Bond et al. (2010) and combine circumstellar disk models, chemical equilibrium calculations and dynamical simulations of planet formation to study the bulk composition of rocky planets. We use condensation sequence calculations to estimate the initial abundance of solids in the circumstellar disk with properties determined from time dependent theoretical models. We combine this with dynamical simulations of planetesimal growth that trace the solids during the planet formation process. We calculate the elemental abundances in the resulting planets and explore how these vary with the choice of disk model and the initial conditions within the Solar Nebula. Although certain characteristics of the terrestrial planets in the Solar System could be reproduced, none of our models could reproduce the abundance properties of all the planets. We found that the choice of the initial planetesimal disk mass and of the disk model has a significant effect on composition gradients. Disk models that give higher pressure and temperature result in larger variations in the bulk chemical compositions of the resulting planets due to inhomogeneities in the element abundance profiles and due to the different source regions of the planets in the dynamical simulations. We observed a trend that massive planets and planets with relatively small semi-major axes are more sensitive to these variations than smaller planets at larger radial distance. Only these large variations in the simulated chemical abundances can potentially explain the diverse bulk composition of the Solar System planets, whereas Mercury's bulk composition can not be reproduced in our approach.","Radio interferometry allows astronomers to probe small spatial scales that are often inaccessible with single-dish instruments. However, recovering the radio sky from an interferometer is an ill-posed deconvolution problem that astronomers have worked on for half a century. More challenging still is achieving resolution below the array's diffraction limit, known as super-resolution imaging. To this end, we have developed a new learning-based approach for radio interferometric imaging, leveraging recent advances in the classical computer vision problems of single-image super-resolution (SISR) and deconvolution. We have developed and trained a high dynamic range residual neural network to learn the mapping between the dirty image and the true radio sky. We call this procedure POLISH, in contrast to the traditional CLEAN algorithm. The feed forward nature of learning-based approaches like POLISH is critical for analyzing data from the upcoming Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-2000). We show that POLISH achieves super-resolution, and we demonstrate its ability to deconvolve real observations from the Very Large Array (VLA). Super-resolution on DSA-2000 will allow us to measure the shapes and orientations of several hundred million star forming radio galaxies (SFGs), making it a powerful cosmological weak lensing survey and probe of dark energy.

Front propagation in three-dimensional corrugated reaction-diffusion media,D-dimensional developed MHD turbulence: Double expansion model,False,"Propagation of traveling fronts in three-dimensional reaction-diffusion media with spatially modulated cross-section is studied using the Schl\""ogl model as a representative example. Applying appropriate perturbation techniques leads first to a reduction of dimensionality in which the spatially dependent Neumann boundary condition translate into a boundary-induced advection term and, secondly, to an equation of motion for the traveling wave position in weakly corrugated confinements. Comparisons with numerical simulations demonstrate that our analytical results properly predicts the nonlinear dependence of the propagation velocity on ratio of the spatial period of the confinement to the intrinsic width of the front; including the peculiarity of propagation failure. Based on the eikonal equation, we obtain an analytical estimate for the finite interval of propagation failure. Lastly, we demonstrate that the front velocity is determined by the suppressed diffusivity of the reactants if the intrinsic width of the front is much larger than the spatial variation of the medium.","Developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence near two dimensions $d$ up to three dimensions has been investigated by means of renormalization group approach and double expansion regularization. A modification of standard minimal subtraction scheme has been used to analyze the stability of the Kolmogorov scaling regime which is governed by the renormalization group fixed point. The exact analytical expressions have been obtained for the fixed points. The continuation of the universal value of the inverse Prandtl number $u=1.562$ determined at $d=2$ up to $d=3$ restores the value of $u=1.393$ which is known in the kinetic fixed point from usual $\epsilon$-expansion. The magnetic stable fixed point has been calculated and its stability region has been also examined. This point losses stability: (1) below critical value of dimension $d_c=2.36$ (independently on the $a$-parameter of a magnetic forcing) and, (2) below the value of $a_c=0.146$ (independently on the dimension).",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Equations of motion for two-body problem according to an observer inside the gravitational field,The Structure of The Heliopause,False,"In this paper we consider equations of motion for 2-body problem according to an observer close to one of the gravitational bodies. The influence of the Thomas precession of the observer's frame has an important role. The equations of motion are based on a nonlinear connection modified by the action of an orthogonal tensor which synchronizes the 4-velocities of the considered two bodies. Finally we present periastron shift according to an observer inside the gravitational field, using the orthonormal coordinates.

Elliptical instability in hot Jupiter systems,Discovery of periodic dips in the brightest hard X-ray source of M31 with EXTraS,False,"Several studies have already considered the influence of tides on the evolution of systems composed of a star and a close-in companion to tentatively explain different observations such as the spin-up of some stars with hot Jupiters, the radius anomaly of short orbital period planets and the synchronization or quasi-synchronization of the stellar spin in some extreme cases. However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal dissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the so-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems, explaining some systematic features present in the observations. This hydrodynamic instability, arising in rotating flows with elliptical streamlines, is suspected to be present in both planet and star of such systems, which are elliptically deformed by tides. The presence and the influence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot Jupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical simulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated to the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of ad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of compressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the incompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability to grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized latitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the fluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a centrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an incompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability. Finally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the main tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and misaligned stars is consistent with current data.","We performed a search for eclipsing and dipping sources in the archive of the EXTraS project - a systematic characterization of the temporal behaviour of XMM-Newton point sources. We discovered dips in the X-ray light curve of 3XMM J004232.1+411314, which has been recently associated with the hard X-ray source dominating the emission of M31.

A Fast Algorithm for Calculation of Th\^eo1,Mechanical mode dependence of bolometric back-action in an AFM microlever,False,"Th\^eo1 is a frequency stability statistic which is similar to the Allan variance but can provide stability estimates at longer averaging factors and with higher confidence. However, the calculation of Th\^eo1 is significantly slower than the Allan variance, particularly for large data sets, due to a worse computational complexity. A faster algorithm for calculating the `all-$\tau$' version of Th\^eo1 is developed by identifying certain repeated sums and removing them with a recurrence relation. The new algorithm has a reduced computational complexity, equal to that of the Allan variance. Computation time is reduced by orders of magnitude for many datasets. The new, faster algorithm does introduce an error due to accumulated floating point errors in very large datasets. The error can be compensated for by increasing the numerical precision used at critical steps. The new algorithm can also be used to increase the speed of Th\^eoBr and Th\^eoH which are more sophisticated statistics derived from Th\^eo1.","Two back action (BA) processes generated by an optical cavity based detection device can deeply transform the dynamical behavior of an AFM microlever: the photothermal force or the radiation pressure. Whereas noise damping or amplifying depends on optical cavity response for radiation pressure BA, we present experimental results carried out under vacuum and at room temperature on the photothermal BA process which appears to be more complex. We show for the first time that it can simultaneously act on two vibration modes in opposite direction: noise on one mode is amplified whereas it is damped on another mode. Basic modeling of photothermal BA shows that dynamical effect on mechanical mode is laser spot position dependent with respect to mode shape. This analysis accounts for opposite behaviors of different modes as observed.","Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Data analysis, statistics and probability in physics focuses on methods, software and hardware for physics data analysis: data processing and storage; measurement methodology; statistical and mathematical aspects such as parametrization and uncertainties."
Testing MONDian Dark Matter with Galactic Rotation Curves,"Symmergent Gravity, Seesawic New Physics, and their Experimental Signatures",False,"MONDian dark matter (MDM) is a new form of dark matter quantum that naturally accounts for Milgrom's scaling, usually associated with modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), and theoretically behaves like cold dark matter (CDM) at cluster and cosmic scales. In this paper, we provide the first observational test of MDM by fitting rotation curves to a sample of 30 local spiral galaxies (z approximately 0.003). For comparison, we also fit the galactic rotation curves using MOND, and CDM. We find that all three models fit the data well. The rotation curves predicted by MDM and MOND are virtually indistinguishable over the range of observed radii (~1 to 30 kpc). The best-fit MDM and CDM density profiles are compared. We also compare with MDM the dark matter density profiles arising from MOND if Milgrom's formula is interpreted as Newtonian gravity with an extra source term instead of as a modification of inertia. We find that discrepancies between MDM and MOND will occur near the center of a typical spiral galaxy. In these regions, instead of continuing to rise sharply, the MDM mass density turns over and drops as we approach the center of the galaxy. Our results show that MDM, which restricts the nature of the dark matter quantum by accounting for Milgrom's scaling, accurately reproduces observed rotation curves.","The standard model of elementary particles (SM) suffers from various problems, such as power-law ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity, exclusion of general relativity (GR), and absence of a dark matter candidate. The LHC experiments, according to which the TeV domain appears to be empty of new particles, started sidelining TeV-scale SUSY and other known cures of the UV sensitivity. In search for a remedy, in this work, it is revealed that affine curvature can emerge in a way restoring gauge symmetries explicitly broken by the UV cutoff. This emergent curvature cures the UV sensitivity and incorporates GR as symmetry-restoring emergent gravity ({\it symmergent gravity}, in brief) if a new physics sector (NP) exists to generate the Planck scale and if SM+NP is fermi-bose balanced. This setup, carrying fingerprints of trans-Planckian SUSY, predicts that gravity is Einstein (no higher-curvature terms), cosmic/gamma rays can originate from heavy NP scalars, and the UV cutoff might take right value to suppress the cosmological constant (alleviating fine-tuning with SUSY). The NP does not have to couple to the SM. In fact, NP-SM coupling can take any value from zero to $\Lambda^2_{SM}/\Lambda^2_{NP}$ if the SM is not to jump from $\Lambda_{SM}\approx 500\, {\rm GeV}$ to the NP scale $\Lambda_{NP}$. The zero coupling, certifying an undetectable NP, agrees with all the collider and dark matter bounds at present. The {\it seesawic} bound $\Lambda^2_{SM}/\Lambda^2_{NP}$, directly verifiable at colliders, implies that: {\it (i)} dark matter must have a mass $\lesssim \Lambda_{SM}$, {\it (ii)} Higgs-curvature coupling must be $\approx 1.3\%$, {\it (iii)} the SM RGEs must remain nearly as in the SM, and {\it (iv)} right-handed neutrinos must have a mass $\lesssim 1000\, {\rm TeV}$.

Mapping the ionised gas around the luminous QSO HE 1029-1401: Evidence for minor merger events?,A VLT/FLAMES survey for massive binaries in Westerlund 1: II. Dynamical constraints on magnetar progenitor masses from the eclipsing binary W13,False,"We present VIMOS integral field spectroscopy of the brightest radio-quiet QSO on the southern sky HE 1029-1401 at a redshift of z=0.086. Standard decomposition techniques for broad-band imaging are extended to integral field data in order to deblend the QSO and host emission. We perform a tentative analysis of the stellar continuum finding a young stellar population (<100Myr) or a featureless continuum embedded in an old stellar population (10Gyr) typical for a massive elliptical galaxy. The stellar velocity dispersion of sigma_*=320\pm90 km/s and the estimated black hole mass log(M_BH/M_sun)=8.7\pm0.3 are consistent with the local M_BH-sigma_* relation within the errors. For the first time we map the two-dimensional ionised gas distribution and the gas velocity field around HE 1029-1401. While the stellar host morphology is purely elliptical we find a highly structured distribution of ionised gas out to 16 kpc from the QSO. The gas is highly ionised solely by the QSO radiation and has a significantly lower metallicity than would be expected for the stellar mass of the host, indicating an external origin of the gas most likely due to minor mergers. We find a rotating gas disc around the QSO and a dispersion-dominated non-rotating gas component within the central 3 kpc. At larger distances the velocity field is heavily disturbed, which could be interpreted as another signature of past minor merger events. Alternatively, the arc-like structure seen in the ionised gas might also be indicative of a large-scale expanding bubble, centred on and possibly driven by the active nucleus.","Westerlund 1 is a young, massive Galactic starburst cluster that contains a rich coeval population of Wolf-Rayet stars, hot- and cool-phase transitional supergiants, and a magnetar. We use spectroscopic and photometric observations of the eclipsing double-lined binary W13 to derive dynamical masses for the two components, in order to determine limits for the progenitor masses of the magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 and the population of evolved stars in Wd1. W13 has an orbital period of 9.2709+/-0.0015 days and near-contact configuration. The shallow photometric eclipse rules out an inclination greater than 65 degrees, leading to lower limits for the masses of the emission-line optical primary and supergiant optical secondary of 21.4+/-2.6Msun and 32.8+/-4.0Msun respectively, rising to 23.2 +3.3/-3.0Msun and 35.4 +5.0/-4.6 Msun for our best-fit inclination 62 +3/-4 degrees. Comparison with theoretical models of Wolf-Rayet binary evolution suggest the emission-line object had an initial mass in excess of 35Msun, with the most likely model featuring highly non-conservative late-Case-A/Case-B mass transfer and an initial mass in excess of 40Msun. This confirms the high magnetar progenitor mass inferred from its membership in Wd1, and represents the first dynamical constraint on the progenitor mass of any magnetar. The red supergiants in Wd1 must have similar progenitor masses to W13 and are therefore amongst the most massive stars to undergo a red supergiant phase, representing a challenge for population models that suggest stars in this mass range end their redwards evolution as yellow hypergiants.

"Gamow-Teller strength for the analog transitions to the first T=1/2, J^pi=3/2- states in 13C and 13N and the implications for Type Ia supernovae",Phi-Phi Back-to-Back Correlations in Finite Expanding Systems,False,"The Gamow-Teller strength for the transition from the ground state of 13C to the T=1/2, J^pi=3/2- excited state at 3.51 MeV in 13N is extracted via the 13C(3He,t) reaction at 420 MeV. In contrast to results from earlier (p,n) studies on 13C, a good agreement with shell-model calculations and the empirical unit cross section systematics from other nuclei is found. The results are used to study the analog 13N(e-,v_e)13C reaction, which plays a role in the pre-explosion convective phase of type Ia supernovae. Although the differences between the results from the (3He,t) and (p,n) data significantly affect the deduced electron-capture rate and the net heat-deposition in the star due to this transition, the overall effect on the pre-explosive evolution is small.","Back-to-Back Correlations (BBC) of particle-antiparticle pairs are predicted to appear if hot and dense hadronic matter is formed in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. The BBC are related to in-medium mass-modification and squeezing of the quanta involved. Although the suppression of finite emission times were already known, the effects of finite system sizes and of collective phenomena had not been studied yet. Thus, for testing the survival and magnitude of the effect in more realistic situations, we study the BBC when mass-modification occurs in a finite sized, thermalized medium, considering a non-relativistically expanding fireball with finite emission time, and evaluating the width of the back-to-back correlation function. We show that the BBC signal indeed survives the expansion and flow effects, with sufficient magnitude to be observed at RHIC.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Deterministic Chaos and the Foundations of the Kinetic Theory of Gases,The bi-Hamiltonian structure and new solutions of KdV6 equation,False,"Recent work in dynamical systems theory has shown that many properties that are associated with irreversible processes in fluids can be understood in terms of the dynamical properties of reversible, Hamiltonian systems. That is, stochastic-like behavior is possible for these systems. Here we review the basic theory for this stochastic-like behavior and show how it may be used to obtain an understanding of irreversible processes in gases and fluids. Recent, closely related, work on the use of kinetic theory to calculate dynamical quantities such as Lyapunov exponents is also discussed.","We show that the KdV6 equation recently studied in [1,2] is equivalent to the Rosochatius deformation of KdV equation with self-consistent sources (RD-KdVESCS) recently presented in [9].

IBM-1 calculations towards the neutron-rich nucleus $^{106}$Zr,"Constraining the destruction rate of $^{40}$K in stellar nucleosynthesis through the study of the $^{40}$Ar(p,n)$^{40}$K reaction",False,"The neutron-rich N=66 isotonic and A=106 isobaric chains, covering regions with varying types of collectivity, are interpreted in the framework of the interacting boson model. Level energies and electric quadrupole transition probabilities are compared with available experimental information. The calculations for the known nuclei in the two chains are extrapolated towards the neutron-rich nucleus $^{106}$Zr.","40K plays a significant role in the radiogenic heating of earth-like exoplanets, which can affect the development of a habitable environment on their surfaces. The initial amount of 40K in the interior of these planets depends on the composition of the interstellar clouds from which they formed. Within this context, nuclear reactions that regulate the production of 40K during stellar evolution can play a critical role. In this study, we constrain for the first time the astrophysical reaction rate of 40K(n,p)40Ar, which is responsible for the destruction of 40K during stellar nucleosynthesis. We performed differential cross-section measurements on the 40Ar(p,n)40K reaction, for six energies in the center-of-mass between 3.2 and 4.0 MeV and various angles between 0-deg and 135-deg. The experiment took place at the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory at Ohio University using the beam swinger target location and a standard neutron time-of-flight technique. The total and partial cross-sections varied with energy due to the contribution from isobaric analog states and Ericson type fluctuations. The energy-averaged neutron angular distributions were symmetrical relative to 90-deg and consistent with the theoretical predictions of the statistical model. Based on the experimental data, local transmission coefficients were extracted and were used to calculate the astrophysical reaction rates of 40Ar(p,n)40K and 40K(n,p)40Ar reactions. Our results support that the destruction rate of 40K in massive stars via the 40K(n,p)40Ar reaction is larger compared to previous estimates. This result directly affects the predicted stellar yields of 40K from nucleosynthesis, which is a critical input parameter for the galactic chemical evolution models that are currently employed for the study of significant properties of exoplanets.",Nuclear Theory,"Nuclear theory in physics focuses on theory of nuclear structure covering wide area from models of hadron structure to neutron stars.

Form factors of $P\to T$ transition within the light-front quark models,More about Electroweak Baryogenesis in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model,False,"In this paper, we calculate the vector, axial-vector and tensor form factors of $P\to T$ transition within the standard light-front~(SLF) and covariant light-front~(CLF) quark models~(QMs). The self-consistency and Lorentz covariance of CLF QM with two types of correspondence schemes are investigated. The zero-mode effects and the spurious $\omega$-dependent contributions to the form factors of $P\to T$ transition are analyzed. Employing a self-consistent CLF QM, we present our numerical predictions for the vector, axial-vector and tensor form factors of $c\to (q,s)$~($q=u,d$) induced $D \to (a_2,K^*_2)$, $D_s \to (K^*_2,f'_{2})$, $\eta_c(1S) \to (D^*_2,D^*_{s2})$, $ B_c \to (B^*_2,B^*_{s2})$ transitions and $b\to (q,s,c)$ induced $B \to (a_2,K^*_2,D^*_2)$, $B_s \to (K^*_2,f'_2,D^*_{s2})$, $B_c \to (D^*_2,D^*_{s2},\chi_{c2}(1P))$, $\eta_b(1S) \to (B^*_2,B^*_{s2})$ transitions.

It is expected that our results for the form factors of $P\to T$ transition can be applied further to the relevant phenomenological studies of meson decays.","We compute the baryon asymmetry generated at the electroweak phase transition by the Higgs scalar sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model.

Coherent Curvature Radiation Spectrum by Dynamically Fluctuating Bunches in Magnetospheres,The Recent Growth History of the Fornax Cluster Derived from Simultaneous Sloshing and Gas Stripping: Simulating the Infall of NGC 1404,False,"Coherent curvature radiation by charged bunches has been discussed as the radiation mechanism for radio pulsars and fast radio bursts. Important issues for this radiation mechanism include how the bunches form and disperse in the magnetosphere of a pulsar or magnetar. More likely, bunches form and disperse continuously and it remains unclear what the spectral features are for these fluctuating bunches. In this work, we consider that the bunches in a magnetosphere have a formation rate of $\lambda_B$, a lifetime of $\tau_B$, and a typical Lorentz factor of $\gamma$, and analyze the spectral features of coherent curvature radiation by these fluctuating bunches. We find that the emission spectrum by a single fluctuating bunch is suppressed by a factor of $\sim(\lambda_B\tau_B)^2$ compared with that of a single persistent bunch, and there is a quasi-white noise in a wider band in the frequency domain. The high-frequency cutoff of the spectrum is at $\sim\max(\omega_{\rm peak},2\gamma^2/\tau_B)$, where $\omega_{\rm peak}$ is the peak frequency of curvature radiation. If the observed spectrum is not white-noise-like, the condition of $2\gamma^2\lambda_B\gtrsim \min(\omega_{\rm peak},2\gamma^2/\tau_B)$ would be required. Besides, the radiation by multiple fluctuating bunches along a field line is the incoherent summation of the radiation by single bunches if the bunch separation is longer than the wavelength. Conversely, a coherent summation should be involved. We also discuss the effects of bunch structures and the mechanism of bunch formation and dispersion.","We derive the recent growth history of the Fornax Cluster, in particular the recent infall of the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1404. We show, using a simple cluster minor merger simulation tailored to Fornax and NGC 1404, that a second or more likely third encounter between the two reproduces all main merger features observed in both objects; we firmly exclude a first infall scenario. Our simulations reveal a consistent picture: NGC 1404 passed by NGC 1399 about 1.1 - 1.3 Gyrs ago from the NE to the SW and is now almost at the point of its next encounter from the S. This scenario explains the sloshing patterns observed in Fornax - a prominent northern cold front and an inner southern cold front. This scenario also explains the truncated atmosphere, the gas stripping radius of NGC 1404, and its faint gas tail. Independent of the exact history, we can make a number of predictions. A detached bow shock south of NGC 1404 should exist which is a remnant of the galaxy's previous infall at a distance from NGC 1404 between 450 - 750 kpc with an estimated Mach number between 1.3 and 1.5. The wake of NGC 1404 also lies S of the galaxy with enhanced turbulence and a slight enhancement in metallicity compared to the undisturbed regions of the cluster. SW of NGC 1404, there is likely evidence of old turbulence originating from the previous infall.

Nucleon electromagnetic form factors from lattice QCD,Quantum Entanglement in Multi-field Inflation,False,"It is imperative that lattice QCD serve to develop our understanding of hadron structure and, where possible, to guide the interpretation of experimental data. There is now a great deal of effort directed at the calculation of the electroweak form factors of the nucleon, where for example, measurements at Jefferson Laboratory have recently revealed surprising behaviour in the ratio $G_E/G_M$. While, for the present, calculations within the framework of lattice QCD are limited to relatively large quark mass, there has been considerable progress in our understanding of how to extrapolate to the chiral limit. Here we report the results of the application of these techniques to the most recent form factor data from the QCDSF Collaboration. The level of agreement with all of the form factors, for $Q^2$ below 1 GeV$^2$, is already impressive.","We study the emergence of quantum entanglement in multi-field inflation. In this scenario, the perturbations of one field contribute to the observable curvature perturbation, while multi-field dynamics with the other fields affect the curvature perturbation through particle production and entanglement. We develop a general formalism which defines the quantum entanglement between the perturbations of the multiple fields both in the Heisenberg and Schr\""odinger pictures, and show that entanglement between different fields can arise dynamically in the context of multi-field inflationary scenarios.

Bifurcations in Boltzmann-Langevin One Body dynamics for fermionic systems,High-mass dimuon resonances in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.5 TeV in CMS,False,"We investigate the occurrence of bifurcations in the dynamical trajectories depicting central nuclear collisions at Fermi energies. The quantitative description of the reaction dynamics is obtained within a new transport model, based on the solution of the Boltzmann-Langevin equation in three dimensions, with a broad applicability for dissipative fermionic dynamics. Dilute systems formed in central collisions are shown to fluctuate between two energetically favourable mechanisms: reverting to a compact shape or rather disintegrating into several fragments. The latter result can be connected to the recent observation of bimodal distributions for quantities characterising fragmentation processes and may suggest new investigations.","The measurement of the charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi'$) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon$, $\Upsilon'$, ${\Upsilon''}$) resonances and $Z^0$ boson in nucleus-nucleus collisions provides crucial information on high density QCD matter. The observation of anomalous suppression of $J/\psi$ at the CERN-SPS and RHIC is well established but the clarification of some important questions requires equivalent studies of the $\Upsilon$ family, only possible at LHC energies. The $Z^0$ boson will be produced for the first time in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and, since its dominant production channel is through $q{\bar q}$ fusion, it is an excellent probe of the nuclear modification of quark distribution functions.

Painleve equations in terms of entire functions,"Shear dispersion along circular pipes is affected by bends, but the torsion of the pipe is negligible",False,"In these lectures we discuss how the Painleve equations can be written in terms of entire functions, and then in the Hirota bilinear (or multilinear) form. Hirota's method, which has been so useful in soliton theory, is reviewed and connections from soliton equations to Painleve equations through similarity reductions are discussed from this point of view. In the main part we discuss how singularity structure of the solutions and formal integration of the Painleve equations can be used to find a representation in terms of entire functions. Sometimes the final result is a pair of Hirota bilinear equations, but for $P_{VI}$ we need also a quadrilinear expression. The use of discrete versions of Painleve equations is also discussed briefly. It turns out that with discrete equations one gets better information on the singularities, which can then be represented in terms of functions with a simple zero.","The flow of a viscous fluid along a curving pipe of fixed radius is driven by a pressure gradient. For a generally curving pipe it is the fluid flux which is constant along the pipe and so I correct fluid flow solutions of Dean (1928) and Topakoglu (1967) which assume constant pressure gradient. When the pipe is straight, the fluid adopts the parabolic velocity profile of Poiseuille flow; the spread of any contaminant along the pipe is then described by the shear dispersion model of Taylor (1954) and its refinements by Mercer, Watt et al (1994,1996). However, two conflicting effects occur in a generally curving pipe: viscosity skews the velocity profile which enhances the shear dispersion; whereas in faster flow centrifugal effects establish secondary flows that reduce the shear dispersion. The two opposing effects cancel at a Reynolds number of about 15. Interestingly, the torsion of the pipe seems to have very little effect upon the flow or the dispersion, the curvature is by far the dominant influence. Lastly, curvature and torsion in the fluid flow significantly enhance the upstream tails of concentration profiles in qualitative agreement with observations of dispersion in river flow.",Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems,"Exactly solvable and integrable systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that can be solved exactly through analytical methods or have properties that allow for integrability.

A New Car-Following Model Inspired by Galton Board,Examples of the Zeroth Theorem of the History of Physics,False,"Different from previous models based on scatter theory and random matrix theory, a new interpretation of the observed log-normal type time-headway distribution of vehicles is presented in this paper. Inspired by the well known Galton Board, this model views driver's velocity adjusting process similar to the dynamics of a particle falling down a board and being deviated at decision points. A new car-following model based on this idea is proposed to reproduce the observed traffic flow phenomena. The agreement between the empirical observations and the simulation results suggests the soundness of this new approach.","The zeroth theorem of the history of science (enunciated by E. P.

Investigation of two Fermi-LAT gamma-ray blazars coincident with high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube,A Puzzle Involving Galactic Bulge Microlensing Events,False,"After the identification of the gamma-ray blazar TXS 0506+056 as the first compelling IceCube neutrino source candidate, we perform a systematic analysis of all high-energy neutrino events satisfying the IceCube realtime trigger criteria. We find one additional known gamma-ray source, the blazar GB6 J1040+0617, in spatial coincidence with a neutrino in this sample. The chance probability of this coincidence is 30% after trial correction. For the first time, we present a systematic study of the gamma-ray flux, spectral and optical variability, and multi-wavelength behavior of GB6 J1040+0617 and compare it to TXS 0506+056. We find that TXS 0506+056 shows strong flux variability in the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray band, being in an active state around the arrival of IceCube-170922A, but in a low state during the archival IceCube neutrino flare in 2014/15. In both cases the spectral shape is statistically compatible ($\leq 2\sigma$) with the average spectrum showing no indication of a significant relative increase of a high-energy component. While the association of GB6 J1040+0617 with the neutrino is consistent with background expectations, the source appears to be a plausible neutrino source candidate based on its energetics and multi-wavelength features, namely a bright optical flare and modestly increased gamma-ray activity. Finding one or two neutrinos originating from gamma-ray blazars in the given sample of high-energy neutrinos is consistent with previously derived limits of neutrino emission from gamma-ray blazars, indicating the sources of the majority of cosmic high-energy neutrinos remain unknown.","We study a sample of 16 microlensed Galactic bulge main sequence turnoff region stars for which high dispersion spectra have been obtained with detailed abundance analyses. We demonstrate that there is a very strong and highly statistically significant correlation between the maximum magnification of the microlensed bulge star and the value of the [Fe/H] deduced from the high resolution spectrum of each object. Physics demands that this correlation, assuming it to be real, be the result of some sample bias. We suggest several possible explanations, but are forced to reject them all,and are left puzzled.

Low-ionization galaxies and evolution in a pilot survey up to z = 1,Gaseous Mean Opacities for Giant Planet and Ultracool Dwarf Atmospheres over a Range of Metallicities and Temperatures,False,"We present galaxy spectroscopic data on a pencil beam of $10.75' \times7.5'$ centered on the X-ray cluster RXJ0054.0-2823 at $z = 0.29$. We study the spectral evolution of galaxies from $z=1$ down to the cluster redshift in a magnitude-limited sample at $\rm R\leq23$, for which the statistical properties of the sample are well understood. We divide emission-line galaxies in star-forming galaxies, LINERs, and Seyferts by using emission-line ratios of [OII], $\rm H\beta$, and [OIII], and derive stellar fractions from population synthesis models. We focus our analysis on absorption and low-ionization galaxies. For absorption-line galaxies we recover the well known result that these galaxies have had no detectable evolution since $z\sim0.6-0.7$, but we also find that in the range $z=0.65-1$ at least 50% of the stars in bright absorption systems are younger than 2.5Gyr. Faint absorption-line galaxies in the cluster at $z = 0.29$ also had significant star formation during the previous 2-3Gyr, while their brighter counterparts seem to be composed only of old stars. At $z\sim0.8$, our dynamically young cluster had a truncated red-sequence. This result seems to be consistent with a scenario where the final assembly of E/S0 took place at $z<1$. In the volume-limited range $0.35\leq z\leq0.65$ we find that 23% of the early-type galaxies have LINER-like spectra with $\rm H\beta$ in absorption and a significant component of A stars. The vast majority of LINERs in our sample have significant populations of young and intermediate-aged stars and are thus not related to AGN, but to the population of `retired galaxies' recently identified by Cid-Fernandes et al. (2010) in the SDSS. Early-type LINERs with various fractions of A stars, and E+A galaxies appear to play an important role in the formation of the red sequence.","We present new calculations of Rosseland and Planck gaseous mean opacities relevant to the atmospheres of giant planets and ultracool dwarfs.

The data are compared to the predictions of Faddeev calculations using state-of-the-art two- and three-nucleon potentials. Our data are reasonably well described by calculations for the kinematical configurations at which the three-nucleon force (3NF) effect is predicted to be small. However, striking discrepancies are observed at specific configurations, in particular in the cases of symmetric configurations, where the relative azimuthal angle between the two protons is small which corresponds to the $d(p,{\rm{^{2}He}})n$ channel. The vector analyzing powers of these configurations are compared to the proton deuteron elastic scattering to study the spin-isospin sensitivity of the 3NF models. The results are compared to the earlier results of the proton-deuteron break-up reaction at 190 MeV proton-beam energy \cite{Mardanpour2010}.

Decline in extinction rates and scale invariance in the fossil record,Elliptic solutions to the KP hierarchy and elliptic Calogero-Moser model,False,"We show that the decline in the extinction rate during the Phanerozoic can be accurately parameterized by a logarithmic fit to the cumulative total extinction.

It is known that their poles as functions of $t_2$ move as particles of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model.

The unpolarized and SM cross sections for the same values of helicities are also estimated. The 95\% C.L. exclusion limits on two anomalous photon couplings $\zeta_1$ and $\zeta_2$ are calculated. The best bounds on these couplings are found to be $6.85 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{\ GeV}^{-4}$ and $1.43 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{\ GeV}^{-4}$, respectively. The results are compared with the exclusion bounds obtained previously for the LHC and HL-LHC. It is shown that the light-by-light scattering at the CLIC, especially the polarized, has a greater potential to search for the anomalous quartic neutral couplings of the $\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma$ vertex.","We propose a novel approach to describe the $D^+\to K^+K^-K^+$ decay amplitude, based on chiral effective Lagrangians, which can be used to extract information about $K\bar{K}$ scattering. Our trial function is an alternative to the widely used isobar model and includes both nonresonant three-body interactions and two-body rescattering amplitudes, based on coupled channels and resonances, for S- and P-waves with isospin $0$ and $1$. The latter are unitarized in the $K$-matrix approximation and represent the only source of complex phases in the problem. Free parameters are just resonance masses and coupling constants, with transparent physical meanings. The nonresonant component, given by chiral symmetry as a real polynomium, is an important prediction of the model, which goes beyond the (2+1) approximation. Our approach allows one to disentangle the two-body scalar contributions with different isospins, associated with the $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ channels. We show how the $K\bar{K}$ amplitude can be obtained from the decay $D^+\to K^+K^-K^+$ and discuss extensions to other three-body final states.",High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

On three topical aspects of the N=28 isotonic chain,Ab initio coupled-cluster study of 16-O,False,"The evolution of single-particle orbits along the N=28 isotonic chain is studied within the framework of a relativistic mean-field approximation. We focus on three topical aspects of the N=28 chain: (a) the emergence of a new magic number at Z=14; (b) the possible erosion of the N=28 shell; and (c) the weakening of the spin-orbit splitting among low-j neutron orbits. The present model supports the emergence of a robust Z=14 subshell gap in 48Ca, that persists as one reaches the neutron-rich isotone 42Si. Yet the proton removal from 48Ca results in a significant erosion of the N=28 shell in 42Si. Finally, the removal of s1/2 protons from 48Ca causes a ~50% reduction of the spin-orbit splitting among neutron p-orbitals in 42Si.","We report converged results for the ground and excited states and matter density of 16-O using realistic two-body nucleon-nucleon interactions and coupled-cluster methods and formalism developed in quantum chemistry. Most of the binding is obtained with the coupled-cluster singles and doubles approach. Additional binding due to three-body clusters (triples) is minimal. The coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles provides a good description of the matter density, charge radius, charge form factor, and excited states of a 1-particle-1-hole nature, but it cannot describe the first excited 0+ state. Incorporation of triples has no effect on the latter finding.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Ideal strength of random alloys from first-principles theory,Supersolid structure and excitation spectrum of soft-core bosons in 3D,False,"The all-electron exact muffin-tin orbitals method in combination with the coherent-potential appproximation has been employed to investigate the ideal tensile strengths of elemental V, Mo solids and V- and Mo-based random solid solutions. The present ideal tensile strengths, calculated assuming isotropic Poisson contraction, are 16.1, 26.7 and 37.6 GPa for bcc V in the [001], [111] and [110] directions, respectively, and 26.7 GPa for bcc Mo in the [001] direction, which are all in good agreement with the available theoretical data. When a few percent Tc is introduced in Mo, it is found that the ideal strength decreases in the [001] direction. For the V-based alloys, Cr increases and Ti decreases the ideal tensile strength in all principal directions. Adding the same concentration of Cr and Ti to V leads to ternary alloys with similar ideal strength values as that of pure V. The alloying effects on the ideal strength is explained using the electronic band structure.","By means of a mean-field method, we have studied the zero temperature structure and excitation spectrum of a three-dimensional soft-core bosonic system for a value of the interaction strength that favors a crystal structure made of atomic nano-clusters arranged with FCC ordering. In addition to the longitudinal and transverse phonon branches expected for a normal crystal, the excitation spectrum shows a soft mode related to the breaking of gauge symmetry, which signals a partial superfluid character of the solid. Additional evidence of supersolidity is provided by the calculation of the superfluid fraction, which shows a first-order drop, from 1 to 0.4, at the liquid-supersolid transition and a monotonic decrease as the interaction strength parameter is increased. The conditions for the coexistence of the supersolid with the homogeneous superfluid are discussed, and the surface tension of a representative solid-liquid interface is calculated.",Disordered Systems and Neural Networks,"Disordered systems and neural networks in condensed matter physics focuses on physical systems that are inherently non-crystalline or lack long-range order.

Multilayer shallow-water model with stratification and shear,Was Zidane honest or well-informed? How UEFA barely avoided a serious scandal,False,"The purpose of this paper is to present a shallow-water-type model with multiple inhomogeneous layers featuring variable linear velocity vertical shear and startificaion in horizontal space and time. This is achieved by writing the layer velocity and buoyancy fields as linear functions of depth, with coefficients that depend arbitrarily on horizontal position and time. The model is a generalization of Ripa's (1995) single-layer model to an arbitrary number of layers. Unlike models with homogeneous layers the present model is able to represent thermodynamics processes driven by heat and freshwater fluxes through the surface or mixing processes resulting from fluid exchanges across contiguous layers. A model configuration with only one layer has been previously shown to provide: a very good representation of the exact vertical normal modes up to the first internal mode; an exact representation of long-perturbation (free boundary) baroclinic instability; and a very reasonable representation of short-perturbation (classical Eady) baroclinic instability. Here it is shown that substantially more accurate overall results with respect to single-layer calculations can be achieved by considering a stack of only a few layers. A similar behavior is found in ageostrophic (classical Stone) baroclinic instability by describing accurately the dependence of the solutions on the Richardson number with only two layers.","UEFA European Championship 1996 qualification is known to violate strategy-proofness. It has been proved recently that a team could be better off by exerting a lower effort: it might be optimal to concede some goals in order to achieve a better position among runners-up, and hence avoid a hazardous play-off.

We review recent work on the systematic comparison of the continuum discretized coupled channel method, the adiabatic wave approximation and the Faddeev momentum-space approach. We also explore other aspects of the reaction mechanism and discuss in detail difficulties encountered in the calculations.","A simple formalism describing the light response of CsI(Tl) to heavy ions, which quantifies the luminescence and the quenching in terms of the competition between radiative transitions following the carrier trapping at the Tl activator sites and the electron-hole recombination, is proposed.

Multiphasic profiles for the biologically important ion activities of NaCl and KCl,Ultraviolet radiation impact on the efficiency of commercial crystalline silicon-based photovoltaics: A theoretical thermal-electrical study in realistic device architectures,False,"When plotted in linear transformations of the Michaelis-Menten equation, ion uptake in plants has been shown to be multiphasic, i.e. to be represented by a series of straight lines separated by discontinuous transitions (Nissen 1971, 1974, 1991, 1996). Reanalysis of data for other transport, binding and enzyme systems has also given such kinetics (Nissen and Mart\'in-Nieto 1998). Recently, such profiles have been found for a variety of biological as well as non-biological processes and phenomena, including activation of ion channels, binding, pH, folding/unfolding, effects of various interactions and chain length (Nissen 2015a,b, Nissen 2016a-d). These biological and nonbiological processes have little in common beyond the ions involved. Here I show that the multiphasic property seen in so many systems is present in the fundamental physical properties of the ion themselves. The characteristics of multiphasic profiles have now also been found in profiles for activities of ions in simple inorganic solutions, indicating that they are somehow causing the multiphasic profiles in more complex systems. A set of extensive and precise data (Lee et al. 2002) for the activities of the biologically very important ions Na+, K+ and Cl- (in NaCl and KCl) at four different temperatures (15, 25, 35 and 45oC) will be reanalyzed in the present paper. The activities of NaBr and KBr will be plotted in a forthcoming paper. Extensive data for these and other ion activities Wilczek-Vera et al. (2004) can also be precisely represented by multiphasic profiles (in preparation).","We investigate and evaluate the contribution of the ultraviolet radiation spectrum on the temperature and efficiency of commercial crystalline silicon-based photovoltaics (PVs) that operate outdoors. The investigation is performed by employing a comprehensive thermal-electrical modeling approach which takes into account all the major processes affected by the temperature variation in the photovoltaic devices. We show that effectively reflecting the ultraviolet radiation (i.e. up to a certain wavelength) results in a reduction of the overall operation temperature and enhancement of the PV cell's efficiency. In addition, blocking the high energy ultraviolet photons prolongs the life time of the PV and its performance on the long term.",Biological Physics,"Biological physics focuses on molecular biophysics, cellular biophysics, neurological biophysics, membrane biophysics, single-molecule biophysics, ecological biophysics, quantum phenomena in biological systems (quantum biophysics), theoretical biophysics, molecular dynamics/modeling and simulation, game theory, biomechanics, bioinformatics, microorganisms, virology, evolution, biophysical methods."
"Energy spectra for protons emitted in the reaction Ca-nat(n, xp) at 94 MeV",Towards a universal description of hadronic phase of QCD,False,"The MEDLEY setup based at The Svedberg Laboratory (TSL), Uppsala, Sweden has previously been used to measure double-differential cross-sections for elastic nd scattering, as well as light ion production reactions for various nuclei in the interaction with neutrons around 95 MeV. When moved to the new beam line, the first experimental campaign was on light-ion production from Ca at 94 MeV in February 2005. These data sets have been analyzed for proton production in forward and backward angles. The Delta E - Delta E - E technique have been used to identify protons, and a cutoff as low as 2.5 MeV is achieved. Suppression of events induced by neutrons in the low-energy tail of the neutron field is achieved by time-of-flight techniques. The data are normalized relative to elastic np scattering measured in the 20-degree telescope. Results from an accepted neutron spectrum are presented and some methods to correct for events from low energy neutrons are presented and evaluated. The data are compared with calculations using the nuclear code TALYS. It was found that TALYS systematically overestimates the compound part, and underestimates the pre-equilibrium part of the cross-section.","Mean-field model quantum field theories of hadrons were traditionally developed to describe cold and dense nuclear matter and are by now very well constrained from the recent neutron star merger observations. We show that when augmented with additional known hadrons and resonances but not included earlier, these mean-field models can be extended beyond its regime of applicability. Calculating some specific ratios of baryon number susceptibilities for finite temperature and moderate values of baryon densities within mean-field approximation, we show that these match consistently with the lattice QCD data available at lower densities, unlike the results obtained from a non-interacting hadron resonance gas model. We also estimate the curvature of the line of constant energy density, fixed at its corresponding value at the chiral crossover transition in QCD, in the temperature-density plane. The number density at low temperatures and high density is found to be about twice the nuclear saturation density along the line of constant energy density of $\epsilon=348 \pm 41$ MeV/$\text{fm}^3$. Moreover from this line we can indirectly constrain the critical end-point of QCD to be beyond $\mu_B=596$ MeV for temperature $\sim 125 $ MeV.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Pattern Transitions in Unstable Viscous Convective Medium,"Soliton solutions of non-linear Schrodinger (NLS) and Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equations related to zero curvature in the x,t plane",False,Convection in a thin layer of liquid (gas) with temperature dependent viscosity between poorly heat conducting boundaries is studied within framework of the Proctor-Sivashinsky model. This model is examined in order to study both the flow pattern formation and the second-order structural phase transitions as between patterns with translational invariance as well as between structures with broken translational invariance but keeping a long-range order. The spatial spectrum of arising patterns and estimation of their visual defectiveness are analyzed. The relation between the density of pattern defects and spectral characteristics of the pattern is found. We also discuss the noise effects on the formation of pattern defects. The influence of temperature dependence of viscosity on the process of pattern formation and structure transformations is also discussed. It is shown that the temperature dependence of viscosity inhibits structural transition from regular rolls to square cells.,"Soliton solutions of non-linear NLS and KdV equations are related to compatibility condition between matrices M and H describing the movement of an auxilary function Psi in the x,t plane with a zero curvature condition.

Diverse routes of transition from amplitude to oscillation death in coupled oscillators under additional repulsive link,Strong Ordering by Non-uniformity of Thresholds in a Coupled Map Lattice,False,"We report the existence of diverse routes of transition from amplitude death (AD) to oscillation death (OD) in three different diffusively coupled systems, those are perturbed by a symmetry break- ing repulsive coupling link. For limit cycle systems the transition is through a pitchfork bifurcation (PB) as has been noted before, but in chaotic systems it can be through a saddle-node or a trans- critical bifurcation depending on the nature of the underlying dynamics of the individual systems. The diversity of the routes and their dependence on the complex dynamics of the coupled systems not only broadens our understanding of this important phenomenon but can lead to potentially new practical applications.","The coupled map lattice by Olami {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 68}, 1244 (1992)] is ``doped'' by letting just {\it one} site have a threshold, $T^{*}_{\rm max}$, bigger than the others. On an $L \times L$ lattice with periodic boundary conditions this leads to a transition from avalanche sizes of about one to exactly $L^2$, and after each avalanche stresses distributes among only five distinct values, $\tau_{k}$, related to the parameters $\alpha $ and $T^{*}_{\rm max}$ by $\tau_{k}= k\alpha T^{*}_{\rm max}$ where $k=0,1,2,3,4$.

Change of the plane of oscillation of a Foucault pendulum from simple pictures,How does the past of a soccer match influence its future?,False,"The change of the plane of oscillation of a Foucault pendulum is calculated without using equations of motion, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, parallel transport, or assumptions that are difficult to explain.","Scoring goals in a soccer match can be interpreted as a stochastic process. In the most simple description of a soccer match one assumes that scoring goals can be described by a constant goal rate for each team, implying simple Poissonian and Markovian behavior. Here a general framework for the identification of deviations from this behavior is presented. For this endeavor it is essential to formulate an a priori estimate of the expected number of goals per team in a specific match. The analysis scheme is applied to approximately 40 seasons of the German Bundesliga. It is possible to characterize the impact of the previous course of the match on the present match behavior. This allows one to identify interesting generic features about soccer matches and thus to learn about the hidden complexities behind scoring goals.",Classical Physics,"Classical physics focuses on newtonian and relativistic dynamics; many particle systems; planetary motions; chaos in classical dynamics.

Study of irregular dynamics in an economic model: attractor localization and Lyapunov exponents,"Cumulant Dynamics of a Population under Multiplicative Selection, Mutation and Drift",False,"Cyclicity and instability inherent in the economy can manifest themselves in irregular fluctuations, including chaotic ones, which significantly reduces the accuracy of forecasting the dynamics of the economic system in the long run. We focus on an approach, associated with the identification of a deterministic endogenous mechanism of irregular fluctuations in the economy. Using of a mid-size firm model as an example, we demonstrate the use of effective analytical and numerical procedures for calculating the quantitative characteristics of its irregular limiting dynamics based on Lyapunov exponents, such as dimension and entropy. We use an analytical approach for localization of a global attractor and study limiting dynamics of the model. We estimate the Lyapunov exponents and get the exact formula for the Lyapunov dimension of the global attractor of this model analytically. With the help of delayed feedback control (DFC), the possibility of transition from irregular limiting dynamics to regular periodic dynamics is shown to solve the problem of reliable forecasting. At the same time, we demonstrate the complexity and ambiguity of applying numerical procedures to calculate the Lyapunov dimension along different trajectories of the global attractor, including unstable periodic orbits (UPOs).","We revisit the classical population genetics model of a population evolving under multiplicative selection, mutation and drift. The number of beneficial alleles in a multi-locus system can be considered a trait under exponential selection. Equations of motion are derived for the cumulants of the trait distribution in the diffusion limit and under the assumption of linkage equilibrium. Because of the additive nature of cumulants, this reduces to the problem of determining equations of motion for the expected allele distribution cumulants at each locus. The cumulant equations form an infinite dimensional linear system and in an authored appendix Adam Prugel-Bennett provides a closed form expression for these equations. We derive approximate solutions which are shown to describe the dynamics well for a broad range of parameters. In particular, we introduce two approximate analytical solutions: (1) Perturbation theory is used to solve the dynamics for weak selection and arbitrary mutation rate. The resulting expansion for the system's eigenvalues reduces to the known diffusion theory results for the limiting cases with either mutation or selection absent. (2) For low mutation rates we observe a separation of time-scales between the slowest mode and the rest which allows us to develop an approximate analytical solution for the dominant slow mode. The solution is consistent with the perturbation theory result and provides a good approximation for much stronger selection intensities.",Chaotic Dynamics,"Chaotic dynamics in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of chaotic systems and dynamical systems that exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions, leading to behavior that appears to be random or unpredictable even though the systems are deterministic in nature. in paticular, this includes dynamical systems, chaos, quantum chaos, topological dynamics, cycle expansions, turbulence, and propagation."
The Joint Cascade of Energy and Helicity in Three-Dimensional Turbulence,Exact solutions of a mathematical model describing competition and co-existence of different language speakers,False,"Three-dimensional (3D) turbulence has both energy and helicity as inviscid constants of motion. In contrast to two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, where a second inviscid invariant--the enstrophy--blocks the energy cascade to small scales, in 3D there is a joint cascade of both energy and helicity simultaneously to small scales. The basic cancellation mechanism which permits a joint cascade of energy and helicity is illuminated by means of the helical decomposition of the velocity into positively and negatively polarized waves. This decomposition is employed in the present study both theoretically and also in a numerical simulation of homogeneous and isotropic 3D turbulence. It is shown that the transfer of energy to small scales produces a tremendous growth of helicity separately in the + and - helical modes at high wavenumbers, diverging in the limit of infinite Reynolds number. However, because of a tendency to restore reflection invariance at small scales, the net helicity from both modes remains finite in that limit. The net helicity flux is shown to be constant all the way up to the Kolmogorov wavenumber: there is no shorter inertial-range for helicity cascade than for energy cascade. The transfer of energy and helicity between + and - modes, which permits the joint cascade, is shown to be due to two distinct physical processes, advection and vortex stretching.","The known three-component reaction-diffusion system modeling competition and co-existence of different language speakers is under study. A modification of this system is proposed, which is examined by Lie symmetry method; furthermore exact solutions in the form of traveling fronts are constructed and their properties are identified. Plots of the traveling fronts are presented and the relevant interpretation describing the language shift occurred in Ukraine during the Soviet times is suggested.",Chaotic Dynamics,"Chaotic dynamics in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of chaotic systems and dynamical systems that exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions, leading to behavior that appears to be random or unpredictable even though the systems are deterministic in nature. in paticular, this includes dynamical systems, chaos, quantum chaos, topological dynamics, cycle expansions, turbulence, and propagation."
Ultra-high Q whispering-gallery-mode bottle microresonators: properties and applications,Importance of the advection scheme for the simulation of water isotopes over Antarctica by atmospheric general circulation models: A case study for present-day and Last Glacial Maximum with LMDZ-iso,False,"Highly prolate-shaped whispering-gallery-mode ""bottle microresonators"" have recently attracted considerable attention due to their advantageous properties. We experimentally show that such resonators offer ultra-high quality factors, microscopic mode volumes, and near lossless in- and out-coupling of light using ultra-thin optical fibers. Additionally, bottle microresonators have a simple and customizable mode structure. This enables full tunability using mechanical strain and simultaneous coupling of two ultra-thin coupling fibers in an add-drop configuration. We present two applications based on these characteristics: In a cavity quantum electrodynamics experiment, we actively stabilize the frequency of the bottle microresonator to an atomic transition and operate it in an ultra-high vacuum environment in order to couple single laser-cooled atoms to the resonator mode. In a second experiment, we show that the bottle microresonator can be used as a low-loss, narrow-band add-drop filter. Using the Kerr effect of the silica resonator material, we furthermore demonstrate that this device can be used for single-wavelength all-optical signal processing.","Atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are known to have a warm and isotopically enriched bias over Antarctica. We test here the hypothesis that these biases are partly consequences of a too diffusive advection. Exploiting the LMDZ-iso model, we show that a less diffusive representation of the advection, especially on the horizontal, is very important to reduce the bias in the isotopic contents of precipitation above this area. The choice of an appropriate representation of the advection is thus essential when using GCMs for paleoclimate applications based on polar water isotopes. Too much diffusive mixing along the poleward transport leads to overestimated isotopic contents in water vapor because dehydration by mixing follows a more enriched path than dehydration by Rayleigh distillation. The near-air surface temperature is also influenced, to a lesser extent, by the diffusive properties of the advection scheme directly via the advection of the air and indirectly via the radiative effects of changes in high cloud fraction and water vapor. A too diffusive horizontal advection increases the temperature and so also contributes to enrich the isotopic contents of water vapor over Antarctica through a reduction of the distillation. The temporal relationship, from Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present-day conditions, between the mean annual near-air surface temperature and the water isotopic contents of precipitation for a specific location can also be impacted, with significant consequences on the paleo-temperature reconstruction from observed changes in water isotopes.",Optics,Optics in physics focuses on adaptive optics.

Variable O VI and N V Emission from the X-ray Binary LMC X-3: Heating of the Black Hole Companion,Pulsar Candidate Classification Using A Computer Vision Method Combining with Convolution and Attention,False,"Based on high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with FUSE and COS, we present new detections of O VI and N V emission from the black-hole X-ray binary (XRB) system LMC X-3. We also update the ephemeris of the XRB using recent radial velocity measurements obtained with the echelle spectrograph on the Magellan-Clay telescope. We observe significant velocity variability of the UV emission, and we find that the O VI and N V emission velocities follow the optical velocity curve of the XRB. Moreover, the O VI and N V intensities regularly decrease between binary phase = 0.5 and 1.0, which suggests that the source of the UV emission is increasingly occulted as the B star in the XRB moves from superior to inferior conjunction. These trends suggest that illumination of the B-star atmosphere by the intense X-ray emission from the accreting black hole creates a hot spot on one side of the B star, and this hot spot is the origin of the O VI and N V emission. However, the velocity semiamplitude of the ultraviolet emission, K_{UV}~180 km/s, is lower than the optical semiamplitude; this difference could be due to rotation of the B star. If our hypothesis about the origin of the highly ionized emission is correct, then careful analysis of the emission occultation could, in principle, constrain the inclination of the XRB and the mass of the black hole.","Artificial intelligence methods are indispensable to identifying pulsars from large amounts of candidates.

Small-$x$ Helicity Evolution: an Operator Treatment,Neutron density distributions from antiprotonic 208Pb and 209Bi atoms,False,"We rederive the small-$x$ evolution equations governing quark helicity distribution in a proton using solely an operator-based approach. In our previous works on the subject, the evolution equations were derived using a mix of diagrammatic and operator-based methods. In this work, we re-derive the double-logarithmic small-$x$ evolution equations for quark helicity in terms of the ""polarized Wilson lines"", the operators consisting of light-cone Wilson lines with one or two non-eikonal local operator insertions which bring in helicity dependence. For the first time we give explicit and complete expressions for the quark and gluon polarized Wilson line operators, including insertions of both the gluon and quark sub-eikonal operators. We show that the double-logarithmic small-$x$ evolution of the ""polarized dipole amplitude"" operators, made out of regular light-cone Wilson lines along with the polarized ones constructed here, reproduces the equations derived in our earlier works. The method we present here can be used as a template for determining the small-$x$ asymptotics of any transverse momentum-dependent (TMD) quark (or gluon) parton distribution functions (PDFs), and is not limited to helicity.",The X-ray cascade from antiprotonic atoms was studied for 208Pb and 209Bi. Widths and shifts of the levels due to the strong interaction were determined. Using modern antiproton-nucleus optical potentials the neutron densities in the nuclear periphery were deduced. Assuming two parameter Fermi distributions (2pF) describing the proton and neutron densities the neutron rms radii were deduced for both nuclei. The difference of neutron and proton rms radii /\r_np equal to 0.16 +-(0.02)_{stat} +- (0.04)_{syst} fm for 208Pb and 0.14 +- (0.04)_{stat} +- (0.04)_{syst} fm for 209Bi were determined and the assigned systematic errors are discussed.

Radiation hardness study of BC408 plastic scintillator under 80 MeV proton beam irradiations,On the importance of using exact pairing in the study of pygmy dipole resonance,False,"To investigate the 1.6 GeV high-energy proton beam detector utilized in the CSNS Phase-II upgrade project, a plastic scintillator detector presents a viable option due to its superior radiation hardness. This study investigates the effects of irradiation damage on a BC408 plastic scintillator induced by 80 MeV protons, including absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and light yield tests of BC408 pre- and post-proton irradiation, with a focus on determining the radiation resistance threshold of BC408. The results indicate that the performance of BC408 remains unimpaired at absorbed doses up to 5.14*10^3 Gy/cm3, demonstrating its ability to absorb 1.63*10^13 p/cm3 1.6 GeV protons while maintaining stability. This suggests that BC408 could potentially be used as the 1.6 GeV high-energy proton beam detector in the CSNS Phase-II upgrade project.","The strength functions of giant dipole resonance (GDR) in oxygen $^{18 - 24}$O, calcium $^{50 - 60}$Ca, and tin $^{120 - 130}$Sn isotopes are calculated within the phonon damping model under three approximations: without superfluid pairing, including BCS pairing, and exact pairing gaps. The analysis of the numerical results shows that exact pairing decreases the two-neutron separation energy in light nuclei, but increases it in heavy nuclei as compared to that obtained within the BCS theory. In neutron-rich medium and heavy nuclei, exact pairing significantly enhances the strength located at the low-energy tail of the GDR, which is usually associated with the pygmy dipole resonance. The line shape of the GDR changes significantly with increasing the neutron number within an isotopic chain if the model parameter is kept fixed at the value determined for the stable isotope.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Quarkonium+$\gamma$ production in coherent hadron - hadron interactions at LHC energies,The QCD spin chain S matrix,False,"In this paper we study the $H + \gamma$ ($H = J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$) production in coherent hadron - hadron interactions at LHC energies. Considering the ultrarelativistic protons as a source of photons, we estimate the $\gamma + p \rightarrow H + \gamma + X$ cross section using the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism and considering different sets of values for the matrix elements. Our results for the total $ p + p \rightarrow p + H + \gamma + X$ cross sections and rapidity distributions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ and 14 TeV demonstrate that the experimental analysis of the $J/\Psi + \gamma$ production at LHC is feasible.","Beisert et al. have identified an integrable SU(2,2) quantum spin chain which gives the one-loop anomalous dimensions of certain operators in large N QCD.

Proper-time measurement in accelerated relativistic systems,Unsupervised Full-color Cellular Image Reconstruction through Disordered Optical Fiber,False,"Separate constituents of extended systems measure proper-times on different world-lines. Relating and comparing proper-time measurements along any two such world-lines requires that common simultaneity be possible, which in turn implies that the system is linearly-rigidly moving so that momentary rest frames are identifiable at any stage of the system's journey in space-time. Once momentary rest-frames have been identified, clocks moving on separate world-lines are synchronizable by light-signal communication. The synchronization relations for two clocks are explicitly computed using light-signals exchanged between them. Implications for the clock hypothesis are included. Also, since simultaneity is frame-dependent, incorrect usage of it leads to pseudo-paradoxes. Counter-examples are discussed.","Recent years have witnessed the tremendous development of fusing fiber-optic imaging with supervised deep learning to enable high-quality imaging of hard-to-reach areas. Nevertheless, the supervised deep learning method imposes strict constraints on fiber-optic imaging systems, where the input objects and the fiber outputs have to be collected in pairs. To unleash the full potential of fiber-optic imaging, unsupervised image reconstruction is in demand. Unfortunately, neither optical fiber bundles nor multimode fibers can achieve a point-to-point transmission of the object with a high sampling density, as is a prerequisite for unsupervised image reconstruction. The recently proposed disordered fibers offer a new solution based on the transverse Anderson localization. Here, we demonstrate unsupervised full-color imaging with a cellular resolution through a meter-long disordered fiber in both transmission and reflection modes. The unsupervised image reconstruction consists of two stages. In the first stage, we perform a pixel-wise standardization on the fiber outputs using the statistics of the objects. In the second stage, we recover the fine details of the reconstructions through a generative adversarial network. Unsupervised image reconstruction does not need paired images, enabling a much more flexible calibration under various conditions. Our new solution achieves full-color high-fidelity cell imaging within a working distance of at least 4 mm by only collecting the fiber outputs after an initial calibration. High imaging robustness is also demonstrated when the disordered fiber is bent with a central angle of 60{\deg}. Moreover, the cross-domain generality on unseen objects is shown to be enhanced with a diversified object set.",Classical Physics,"Classical physics focuses on newtonian and relativistic dynamics; many particle systems; planetary motions; chaos in classical dynamics.

On Frequency-Dependent Rock Experiments: A Comparative Review,Unified Description of Matrix Mechanics and Wave Mechanics II,False,"Rock properties are environment- and condition-dependent which render field-laboratory comparisons ambiguous for a number of known and unknown reasons that constitute the upscaling problem. Unknowns are first transformed into knowns in a controlled environment (laboratory) and second in a volatile environment (field). Causality-bound dispersion and attenuation are respectively defined as rock properties that are frequency- and distance-dependent: dispersion implies non-zero attenuation and vice versa. Forced-Oscillation (FO), Resonant-Bar (RB), and Pulse-Transmission (PT). are the customary techniques to measure rock properties at Hz, kHz, and MHz frequencies. Notably FO has emerged as the current champion in bridging the field-laboratory void in recent years. Not only is FO probing seismic (Hz) frequencies but with $\sim10^{-6}$ strain amplitudes it is also similar to field seismic. RB and PT are concisely however FO is verbosely elaborated by chronologically compiling most (if not all) FO studies on sedimentary rocks and comparing all available FO measurements on reference materials such as lucite, aluminium, and PEEK. First of its kind, this inter-laboratory comparison may serve as a reference for others who seek to verify their own results. Differences between FO are discussed with alternative strain and stress sensors being the focal points. Other techniques such as Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS), Laser UltraSonics (LUS), and Differential Acoustic Resonance Spectroscopy (DARS) that are similar to FO, RB, and PT are also described. Only time will tell what the future holds for FO but plausible improvements for the future are ultimately given which may elevate it even further. Experimental combined with numerical novelty will extend the probeable frequencies beyond their current limits.","In this article, we discard the bra-ket notation and its correlative definitions, given by Paul Dirac.

(Anti-)deuteron production and anisotropic flow measured with ALICE at the LHC,Octupole deformations in actinides at high spins within the cranking Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach,False,"The high abundance of (anti-)deuterons in the statistics gathered in Run 1 of the LHC and the excellent performance of the ALICE setup allow for the simultaneous measurement of the elliptic flow and the deuteron production rates with a large transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) reach. The (anti-) deuterons are identified using the specific energy loss in the time projection chamber and the velocity information in the time-of-flight detector. The elliptic flow of (anti-)deuterons can provide insight into the production mechanisms of particles in heavy-ion collisions. Quark coalescence is one of the approaches to describe the elliptic flow of hadrons, while the production of light nuclei can be also depicted as a coalescence of nucleons. In these proceedings, the measured $v_{2}$ of deuterons produced in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=2.76TeV will be compared to expectations from coalescence and hydrodynamic models.","The cranked Skyrme III effective Hamiltonian is applied for the analysis of the rotational dependence of the quadrupole and octupole moments in Ra, Th, and U isotopes.

On the supersymmetric nonlinear evolution equations,Chimera states and the interplay between initial conditions and non-local coupling,False,Supersymmetrization of a nonlinear evolution equation in which the bosonic equation is independent of the fermionic variable and the system is linear in fermionic field goes by the name B-supersymmetrization. This special type of supersymmetrization plays a role in superstring theory. We provide B-supersymmetric extension of a number of quasilinear and fully nonlinear evolution equations and find that the supersymmetric system follows from the usual action principle while the bosonic and fermionic equations are individually non Lagrangian in the field variable. We point out that B-supersymmetrization can also be realized using a generalized Noetherian symmetry such that the resulting set of Lagrangian symmetries coincides with symmetries of the bosonic field equations. This observation provides a basis to associate the bosonic and fermionic fields with the terms of bright and dark solitons. The interpretation sought by us has its origin in the classic work of Bateman who introduced a reverse-time system with negative friction to bring the linear dissipative systems within the framework of variational principle.,"Chimera states are complex spatio-temporal patterns that consist of coexisting domains of coherent and incoherent dynamics. We study chimera states in a network of non-locally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. We investigate the impact of initial conditions in combination with non-local coupling.

Probing magnetars magnetosphere through X-ray polarization measurements,Particle-Particle Particle-Tree: A Direct-Tree Hybrid Scheme for Collisional N-Body Simulations,False,"The study of magnetars is of particular relevance since these objects are the only laboratories where the physics in ultra-strong magnetic fields can be directly tested. Until now, spectroscopic and timing measurements at X-ray energies in soft gamma-repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXPs) have been the main source of information about the physical properties of a magnetar and of its magnetosphere. Spectral fitting in the ~ 0.5-10 keV range allowed to validate the ""twisted magnetosphere"" model, probing the structure of the external field and estimating the density and velocity of the magnetospheric currents. Spectroscopy alone, however, may fail in disambiguating the two key parameters governing magnetospheric scattering (the charge velocity and the twist angle) and is quite insensitive to the source geometry. X-ray polarimetry, on the other hand, can provide a quantum leap in the field by adding two extra observables, the linear polarization degree and the polarization angle. Using the bright AXP 1RXS J170849.0-400910 as a template, we show that phase-resolved polarimetric measurements can unambiguously determine the model parameters, even with a small X-ray polarimetry mission carrying modern photoelectric detectors and existing X-ray optics. We also show that polarimetric measurements can pinpoint vacuum polarization effects and thus provide an indirect evidence for ultra-strong magnetic fields.","In this paper, we present a new hybrid algorithm for the time integration of collisional N-body systems. In this algorithm, gravitational force between two particles is divided into short-range and long-range terms, using a distance-dependent cutoff function. The long-range interaction is calculated using the tree algorithm and integrated with the constant-timestep leapfrog integrator. The short-range term is calculated directly and integrated with the high-order Hermite scheme. We can reduce the calculation cost per orbital period from O(N^2) to O(N log N), without significantly increasing the long-term integration error. The results of our test simulations show that close encounters are integrated accurately.

Probing photo-ionization: Experiments on positive streamers in pure gasses and mixtures,Structural mechanics of filamentous cyanobacteria,False,"Positive streamers are thought to propagate by photo-ionization whose parameters depend on the nitrogen:oxygen ratio. Therefore we study streamers in nitrogen with 20%, 0.2% and 0.01% oxygen and in pure nitrogen, as well as in pure oxygen and argon. Our new experimental set-up guarantees contamination of the pure gases to be well below 1 ppm. Streamers in oxygen are difficult to measure as they emit considerably less light in the sensitivity range of our fast ICCD camera than the other gasses. Streamers in pure nitrogen and in all nitrogen/oxygen mixtures look generally similar, but become somewhat thinner and branch more with decreasing oxygen content. In pure nitrogen the streamers can branch so much that they resemble feathers. This feature is even more pronounced in pure argon, with approximately 10^2 hair tips/cm^3 in the feathers at 200 mbar; this density could be interpreted as the free electron density creating avalanches towards the streamer stem. It is remarkable that the streamer velocity is essentially the same for similar voltage and pressure in all nitrogen/oxygen mixtures as well as in pure nitrogen, while the oxygen concentration and therefore the photo-ionization lengths vary by more than five orders of magnitude. Streamers in argon have essentially the same velocity as well. The physical similarity of streamers at different pressures is confirmed in all gases; the minimal diameters are smaller than in earlier measurements.","Filamentous cyanobacteria, forming long strands of connected cells, are one of the earliest and most successful forms of life on Earth. They exhibit self-organised behaviour, forming large-scale patterns in structures like biomats and stromatolites. The mechanical properties of these rigid structures have contributed to their biological success and are important to applications like algae-based biofuel production. For active polymers like these cyanobacteria, one of the most important mechanical properties is the bending modulus, or flexural rigidity. Here, we quantify the bending stiffness of three species of filamentous cyanobacteria using a microfluidic flow device, where single filaments are deflected by fluid flow. This is complemented by measurements of the Young's modulus of the cell wall, via nanoindentation, and the cell wall thickness. We find that the stiffness of the cyanobacteria is well-captured by a simple model of a flexible rod, with most stress carried by a rigid outer wall. Finally, we connect these results to the curved shapes that these cyanobacteria naturally take while gliding, and quantify the forces generated internally to maintain this shape. The measurements can be used to model interactions between filamentous cyanobacteria, or with their environment, and how their collective behaviour emerges from such interactions.",Plasma Physics,"Plasma physics focuses on fundamental plasma physics.

Atwood's machine with a massive string,Improved axisymmetric lattice Boltzmann scheme,False,"The dynamics of Atwood's machine with a string of significant mass are described by the Lagrangian formalism, providing an eloquent example of how the Lagrangian approach is a great deal simpler and so much more expedient than the Newtonian treatment.","This paper proposes an improved lattice Boltzmann scheme for incompressible axisymmetric flows. The scheme has the following features. First, it is still within the framework of the standard lattice Boltzmann method using the single-particle density distribution function and consistent with the philosophy of the lattice Boltzmann method. Second, the source term of the scheme is simple and contains no velocity gradient terms. Owing to this feature, the scheme is easy to implement. In addition, the singularity problem at the axis can be appropriately handled without affecting an important advantage of the lattice Boltzmann method: the easy treatment of boundary conditions. The scheme is tested by simulating Hagen-Poiseuille flow, three-dimensional Womersley flow, Wheeler benchmark problem in crystal growth, and lid-driven rotational flow in cylindrical cavities.

Additionally, we choose a variant of the Ulam method to numerically approximate the Perron-Frobenius operator for the map, allowing us to calculate the anomalous diffusion exponent via an eigenvalue problem, compared to the solution of the Fractional Diffusion Equation. The results here corroborate other findings in the literature of anomalous transport in Hamiltonian maps and can be suitable to describe transport properties of other dynamical systems.","Wind-driven sound generation is a source of anger and pleasure, depending on the situation: airframe and car noise, or combustion noise are some of the most disturbing environmental pollutions, whereas musical instruments are sources of joy.

Entanglement of skeletal regions,The Tiny (g-2) Muon Wobble from Small-$\mu$ Supersymmetry,False,"The entanglement entropy (EE) encodes key properties of quantum many-body systems. It is usually calculated for subregions of finite volume (or area in 2d). In this work, we study the EE of skeletal regions that have \textit{no} volume, such as a line in 2d. We show that skeletal entanglement displays new behavior compared to its bulk counterpart, and leads to distinct universal quantities. We provide non-perturbative bounds for the skeletal area-law coefficient of a large family of quantum states. We then explore skeletal scaling for the toric code, conformal bosons and Dirac fermions, Lifshitz critical points, and Fermi liquids. We discover signatures including skeletal topological EE, novel corner terms, and strict area-law scaling for metals. These findings suggest that skeletal entropy serves as a measure for the range of entanglement. We discuss the possibility of a continuum description involving the fusion of defect operators. Finally, we outline open questions relating to other systems, and measures such as the logarithmic negativity.","A new measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment has been reported by the Fermilab Muon g-2 collaboration and shows a $4.2\sigma$ departure from the most precise and reliable calculation of this quantity in the Standard Model. Assuming that this discrepancy is due to new physics, we concentrate on a simple supersymmetric model that also provides a dark matter explanation in a previously unexplored region of supersymmetric parameter space. Such interesting region can realize a Bino-like dark matter candidate compatible with all current direct detection constraints for small to moderate values of the Higgsino mass parameter $|\mu|$. This in turn would imply the existence of light additional Higgs bosons and Higgsino particles within reach of the high-luminosity LHC and future colliders.

We claim that in electrostatics, an electric charge must be equal to a rational multiple of the elementary charge of an electron. However, the charge is quantized if the system has certain boundary conditions that force the wavefunction representing an electric field to vanish at specific surfaces. Next, we develop the corresponding model for the electric displacement vector. It is demonstrated that a number of classical results, e.g. bending of field lines at the interface of two dielectric media, method of images, etc. are all consistent with the predictions of this model.

Weak-Lensing Mass Calibration of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Equatorial Sunyaev-Zeldovich Cluster Sample with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey,Repeatability of Spitzer/IRAC exoplanetary eclipses with Independent Component Analysis,False,"Mass calibration uncertainty is the largest systematic effect for using clusters of galaxies to constrain cosmological parameters. We present weak lensing mass measurements from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey for galaxy clusters selected through their high signal-to-noise thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) signal measured with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). For a sample of 9 ACT clusters with a tSZ signal-to-noise greater than five the average weak lensing mass is $\left(4.8\pm0.8\right)\,\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, consistent with the tSZ mass estimate of $\left(4.70\pm1.0\right)\,\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ which assumes a universal pressure profile for the cluster gas. Our results are consistent with previous weak-lensing measurements of tSZ-detected clusters from the Planck satellite. When comparing our results, we estimate the Eddington bias correction for the sample intersection of Planck and weak-lensing clusters which was previously excluded.","The research of effective and reliable detrending methods for Spitzer data is of paramount importance for the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres. To date, the totality of exoplanetary observations in the mid- and far-infrared, at wavelengths $>$3 $\mu$m, have been taken with Spitzer. In some cases, in the past years, repeated observations and multiple reanalyses of the same datasets led to discrepant results, raising questions about the accuracy and reproducibility of such measurements. Morello et al. 2014, 2015 proposed a blind-source separation method based on the Independent Component Analysis of pixel time series (pixel-ICA) to analyze IRAC data, obtaining coherent results when applied to repeated transit observations previously debated in the literature. Here we introduce a variant to pixel-ICA through the use of wavelet transform, wavelet pixel-ICA, which extends its applicability to low-S/N cases. We describe the method and discuss the results obtained over twelve eclipses of the exoplanet XO3b observed during the ""Warm Spitzer"" era in the 4.5 $\mu$m band. The final results will be reported also in Ingalls et al. (in prep.), together with results obtained with other detrending methods, and over ten synthetic eclipses that were analyzed for the ""IRAC Data Challenge 2015"". Our results are consistent within 1 $\sigma$ with the ones reported in Wong et al. 2014. The self-consistency of individual measurements of eclipse depth and phase curve slope over a span of more than three years proves the stability of Warm Spitzer/IRAC photometry within the error bars, at the level of 1 part in 10$^4$ in stellar flux.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Post trimming of silicon photonics microresonators by nanoscale flash memory technology,Design and Performance of the GERDA Low-Background Cryostat for Operation in Water,False,"Flash memory technology is widely common in modern microelectronics, and is essentially affecting our daily life. Considering the recent progress in photonic circuitry, and in particular silicon photonics circuitry, there is now an opportunity to embed the flash memory technology in photonic applications. A particularly promising candidate that can benefit from such integration is the photonic resonator. As of today, chip scale resonators are essential building blocks in modern silicon photonic platform. However, their properties, and in particular their resonance frequencies deviate from their designed values due to unavoidable fabrication imperfections, imposing a stringent limitation on the applicability of such devices. Here we present a solution for this major obstacle and demonstrate electrical approach for post trimming of such resonators. This is achieved by integrating the well-established flash memory technology into the photonic circuitry. More specifically, we use the nanoscale Silicon-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon (SONOS) structure in order to trap charges in the thin silicon nitride layer, which is located in close proximity to the silicon device layer. This enables the accumulation of charges in the silicon, modifying the effective index of the optical mode and consequently the resonance frequency. By doing so, we provide a robust and elegant CMOS compatible memory solution, which can be easily manufactured and commercialized. We expect such an approach to pave the way for even more efficient utilization of resonators and interferometers in chip scale photonic and electro optic systems, with wide range of applications such as filters, modulators, sensors, and lasers, to name a few.",In searching for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{76}$Ge the GERmanium Detector Array (GERDA) experiment at the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso has achieved an unprecedented low background of well below 10$^{-3}$ cts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$yr) in the region of interest. It has taken advantage of the first realization of a novel shielding concept based on a large cryostat filled with a liquid noble gas that is immersed in a water tank. The germanium detectors are operated without encapsulation in liquid argon. Argon and water shield the environmental background from the laboratory and the cryostat construction materials to a negligible level. The same approach has been adopted in the meantime by various experiments. This paper provides an overview of the design and operating experience of the 64 m$^3$ liquid argon cryostat and its associated infrastructure.

Attosecond XUV probing of vibronic quantum superpositions in Br$_2^+$,Video-based analysis of the transition from slipping to rolling,False,"Ultrafast laser excitation can create coherent superpositions of electronic states in molecules and trigger ultrafast flow of electron density on few- to sub-femtosecond time scales. While recent attosecond experiments have addressed real-time observation of these primary photochemical processes, the underlying roles of simultaneous nuclear motions and how they modify and disturb the valence electronic motion remain uncertain. Here, we investigate coherent electronic-vibrational dynamics induced among multiple vibronic levels of ionic bromine (Br$_2^+$), including both spin-orbit and valence electronic superpositions, using attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Decay, revival, and apparent frequency shifts of electronic coherences are measured via characteristic quantum beats on the Br-$3d$ core-level absorption signals. Quantum-mechanical simulations attribute the observed electronic decoherence to broadened phase distributions of nuclear wave packets on anharmonic potentials. Molecular vibronic structure is further revealed to be imprinted as discrete progressions in electronic beat frequencies. These results provide a future basis to interpret complex charge-migration dynamics in polyatomic systems.","The problem of a disc or cylinder initially rolling with slipping on a surface and subsequently transitioning to rolling without slipping is often cited in textbooks. The following experiment serves to clearly demonstrate the transition from rolling with slipping to rolling without slipping. In the experiment, a rotating bicycle wheel was placed in contact with a horizontal surface and the wheel in motion was tracked using Tracker video analysis software [8]. The software created linear velocity plots for the centre of mass and a point on the circumference as well as a plot of the angular velocity of the rotating wheel. The time evolution plots created by Tracker clearly illustrate the transition between the two types of motion.",Chemical Physics,"Chemical physics focuses on experimental, computational, and theoretical physics of atoms, molecules, and clusters - Classical and quantum description of states, processes, and dynamics; spectroscopy, electronic structure, conformations, reactions, interactions, and phases.

First $\pi K$ atom lifetime and $\pi K$ scattering length measurements,"Decuplets, glueballs and nonet anomalies",False,The results of a search for hydrogen-like atoms consisting of $\pi^{\mp}K^{\pm}$ mesons are presented. Evidence for $\pi K$ atom production by 24 GeV/c protons from CERN PS interacting with a nickel target has been seen in terms of characteristic $\pi K$ pairs from their breakup in the same target ($178 \pm 49$) and from Coulomb final state interaction ($653 \pm 42$). Using these results the analysis yields a first value for the $\pi K$ atom lifetime of $\tau=(2.5_{-1.8}^{+3.0})$ fs and a first model-independent measurement of the S-wave isospin-odd $\pi K$ scattering length $\left|a_0^-\right|=\frac{1}{3}\left|a_{1/2}-a_{3/2}\right|= \left(0.11_{-0.04}^{+0.09} \right)M_{\pi}^{-1}$ ($a_I$ for isospin $I$).,A new approach to problem of glueball search is presented. It refers to early J. Rosner's attempts to detect the tensor glueball. In the present description the glueball state is treated on equal footing with singlet $q\bar{q}$ one. Mixing glueball with $q\bar{q}$ nonet creates decuplet. Glueball can be detected as its component. Our approach is based on hypothesis of vanishing exotic commutators described as VEC model. The model describes all multiplets of light mesons. This makes possible to compare the mass patterns of different multiplets. According to VEC description some abnormal nonets can be interpreted as incomplete decuplets. This makes possible to relate the anomaly of the nonet to a glueball component of decuplet. The model reflects rich diversity of strong interaction properties. The treatment presented is quite elementary: only masses of physical states are required to be known.,High Energy Physics - Experiment,"High energy physics - experiment focuses on experimental research in high energy physics.

Orbital ordering in manganites in the band approach,Critical wave-packet dynamics in the power-law bond disordered Anderson Model,False,"We consider the orbital ordering in LaMnO3 and similar systems, proceeding from the band picture. We show that for the realistic magnetic structure of A-type there exists a complete nesting betweeen two e_g-bands. As a result there occurs an instability towards an excitonic insulator-like state -- an electron-hole pairing with the wave vector Q=(\pi,\pi), which opens a gap in the spectrum and makes the system insulating. In the resulting state there appeasr an orbital ordering -- orbital density wave (ODW), the type of which coincides with those existing in LaMnO3.","We investigate the wave-packet dynamics of the power-law bond disordered one-dimensional Anderson model with hopping amplitudes decreasing as $H_{nm}\propto |n-m|^{-\alpha}$. We consider the critical case ($\alpha=1$). Using an exact diagonalization scheme on finite chains, we compute the participation moments of all stationary energy eigenstates as well as the spreading of an initially localized wave-packet. The eigenstates multifractality is characterized by the set of fractal dimensions of the participation moments. The wave-packet shows a diffusive-like spread developing a power-law tail and achieves a stationary non-uniform profile after reflecting at the chain boundaries. As a consequence, the time-dependent participation moments exhibit two distinct scaling regimes. We formulate a finite-size scaling hypothesis for the participation moments relating their scaling exponents to the ones governing the return probability and wave-function power-law decays.",Statistical Mechanics,"Statistical mechanics in condensed matter physics focuses on statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles and the laws that govern their behavior.

Lax pair for the Adler (lattice Krichever-Novikov) System,On ergodic and mixing properties of the triangle map,False,"In the paper [V. Adler, IMRN {\bf 1} (1998) 1--4] a lattice version of the Krichever-Novikov equation was constructed. We present in this note its Lax pair and discuss its elliptic form.","In this paper we study in detail, both analytically and numerically, the dynamical properties of the triangle map, a piecewise parabolic automorphism of the two-dimensional torus, for different values of the two independent parameters defining the map. The dynamics is studied numerically by means of two different symbolic encoding schemes, both relying on the fact that it maps polygons to polygons: in the first scheme we consider dynamically generated partitions made out of suitable sets of disjoint polygons, in the second we consider the standard binary partition of the torus induced by the discontinuity set. These encoding schemes are studied in detail and shown to be compatible, although not equivalent. The ergodic properties of the triangle map are then investigated in terms of the Markov transition matrices associated to the above schemes and furthermore compared to the spectral properties of the Koopman operator in L2(T2). Finally, a stochastic version of the triangle map is introduced and studied. A simple heuristic analysis of the latter yields the correct statistical and scaling behaviours of the correlation functions of the original map.",Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems,"Exactly solvable and integrable systems in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on systems that can be solved exactly through analytical methods or have properties that allow for integrability.

Study of Lambda polarization at RHIC BES and LHC energies,Effective Chiral Symmetry Restoration for Heavy-Light Mesons,False,"In hydrodynamic approach to relativistic heavy ion collisions, hadrons with nonzero spin, produced out of the hydrodynamic medium, can acquire polarization via spin-vorticity thermodynamic coupling mechanism. The hydrodynamical quantity steering the polarization is the thermal vorticity, that is minus the antisymmetric part of the gradient of four-temperature field. Based on this mechanism there have been several calculations in hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic models for non-central heavy ion collisions in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan energy range, showing that the amount of polarization of produced $\Lambda$ hyperons ranges from few percents to few permille, and decreases with collision energy. We report on an extension of our existing calculation of global $\Lambda$ polarization in UrQMD+vHLLE model to full RHIC and LHC energies, and discuss the component of polarization along the beam direction, which is the dominant one at high energies.",We study the spectrum of heavy-light mesons within a model with linear instantaneous confining potential. The single-quark Green function and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry are obtained from the Schwinger-Dyson (gap) equation. For the meson spectrum we derive a Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE).

Deep learning of systematic sea ice model errors from data assimilation increments,Simultaneous Imaging of Widely Differing Particle Concentrations in MPI: Problem Statement and Algorithmic Proposal for Improvement,False,"Data assimilation is often viewed as a framework for correcting short-term error growth in dynamical climate model forecasts. When viewed on the time scales of climate however, these short-term corrections, or analysis increments, can closely mirror the systematic bias patterns of the dynamical model. In this study, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn a mapping from model state variables to analysis increments, in order to showcase the feasibility of a data-driven model parameterization which can predict state-dependent model errors. We undertake this problem using an ice-ocean data assimilation system within the Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system Research (SPEAR) model, developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, which assimilates satellite observations of sea ice concentration every 5 days between 1982--2017. The CNN then takes inputs of data assimilation forecast states and tendencies, and makes predictions of the corresponding sea ice concentration increments. Specifically, the inputs are states and tendencies of sea ice concentration, sea-surface temperature, ice velocities, ice thickness, net shortwave radiation, ice-surface skin temperature, sea-surface salinity, as well as a land-sea mask. We find the CNN is able to make skillful predictions of the increments in both the Arctic and Antarctic and across all seasons, with skill that consistently exceeds that of a climatological increment prediction. This suggests that the CNN could be used to reduce sea ice biases in free-running SPEAR simulations, either as a sea ice parameterization or an online bias correction tool for numerical sea ice forecasts.","Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging technique for determining the spatial distribution of superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Current MPI systems are capable of imaging iron masses over a wide dynamic range of more than four orders of magnitude. In theory, this range could be further increased using adaptive amplifiers, which prevent signal clipping. While this applies to a single sample, the dynamic range is severely limited if several samples with different concentrations or strongly inhomogeneous particle distributions are considered. One scenario that occurs quite frequently in pre-clinical applications is that a highly concentrated tracer bolus in the vascular system ""shadows"" nearby organs with lower effective tracer concentrations. The root cause of the problem is the ill-posedness of the MPI imaging operator, which requires regularization for stable reconstruction. In this work, we introduce a simple two-step algorithm that increases the dynamic range by a factor of four. Furthermore, the algorithm enables spatially adaptive regularization, i.e. highly concentrated signals can be reconstructed with maximum spatial resolution, while low concentrated signals are strongly regularized to prevent noise amplification.",Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics,"Atmospheric and oceanic physics focuses on the physical processes occurring in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

One-loop divergences in two-dimensional Maxwell-dilaton quantum gravity,Chromomagnetic stability of the three flavor Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell phase of QCD,False,"Two-dimensional Maxwell-dilaton quantum gravity, which covers a large family of the actions for two-dimensional gravity (in particular, string-inspired models) is investigated. Charged black holes which appear in the theory are briefly discussed. The one-loop divergences in the linear covariant gauges are calculated.

Effective size of a trapped atomic Bose gas,Ab initio density functional theory study of uranium solubility in Gd2Zr2O7 pyrochlore,False,"We investigate the temperature-dependent effective size of a trapped interacting atomic Bose gas within a mean field theory approximation. The sudden shrinking of the average length, as observed in an earlier experiment by Wang {\it et al.} [Chin. Phys. Lett. {\bf 20}, 799 (2003)], is shown to be a good indication for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Our study also supports the use of the average width of a trapped Bose gas for a nondestructive calibration of its temperature.","In this study, an ab initio calculation is performed to investigate the uranium solubility in different sites of Gd2Zr2O7 pyrochlore. The Gd2Zr2O7 maintains its pyrochlore structure at low uranium dopant levels, and the lattice constants of Gd2(Zr2-yUy)O7 and (Gd2-yUy)Zr2O7 are generally expressed as being linearly related to the uranium content y. Uranium is found to be a preferable substitute for the B-site gadolinium atoms in cation-disordered Gd2Zr2O7 (where gadolinium and zirconium atoms are swapped) over the A-site gadolinium atoms in ordered Gd2Zr2O7 due to the lower total energy of (Gd2-yZry)(Zr2-yUy)O7.

Generating functions of wormholes,Programmable DNA-mediated multitasking processor,False,"It is known that wormhole geometry could be found solving the Einstein field equations by tolerating the violation of null energy condition (NEC). Violation of NEC is not possible for the physical matter distributions, however, can be achieved by considering distributions of ""exotic matter"". The main purpose of this work is to find generating functions comprising the wormhole like geometry and discuss the nature of these generating functions. We have used the Herrera et al. \cite{1} approaches of obtaining generating functions in the background of wormhole spacetime. Here we have adopt two approaches of solving the field equations to find wormhole geometry. In the first method, we have assumed the redshift function $f(r)$ and the shape function $b(r)$ and solve for the generating functions. In an another attempt we assume generating functions and redshift functions and then try to find shape functions of the wormholes.","Because of DNA appealing features as perfect material, including minuscule size, defined structural repeat and rigidity, programmable DNA-mediated processing is a promising computing paradigm, which employs DNAs as information storing and processing substrates to tackle the computational problems. The massive parallelism of DNA hybridization exhibits transcendent potential to improve multitasking capabilities and yield a tremendous speed-up over the conventional electronic processors with stepwise signal cascade. As an example of multitasking capability, we present an in vitro programmable DNA-mediated optimal route planning processor as a functional unit embedded in contemporary navigation systems.

A MODEST review,Cosmic rays in astrospheres,False,"We present an account of the state of the art in the fields explored by the research community invested in 'Modeling and Observing DEnse STellar systems'. For this purpose, we take as a basis the activities of the MODEST-17 conference, which was held at Charles University, Prague, in September 2017. Reviewed topics include recent advances in fundamental stellar dynamics, numerical methods for the solution of the gravitational N-body problem, formation and evolution of young and old star clusters and galactic nuclei, their elusive stellar populations, planetary systems, and exotic compact objects, with timely attention to black holes of different classes of mass and their role as sources of gravitational waves. Such a breadth of topics reflects the growing role played by collisional stellar dynamics in numerous areas of modern astrophysics. Indeed, in the next decade, many revolutionary instruments will enable the derivation of positions and velocities of individual stars in the Milky Way and its satellites and will detect signals from a range of astrophysical sources in different portions of the electromagnetic and gravitational spectrum, with an unprecedented sensitivity. On the one hand, this wealth of data will allow us to address a number of long-standing open questions in star cluster studies; on the other hand, many unexpected properties of these systems will come to light, stimulating further progress of our understanding of their formation and evolution.","Cosmic rays passing through large astrospheres can be efficiently cooled inside these ""cavities"" in the interstellar medium. Moreover, the energy spectra of these energetic particles are already modulated in front of the astrospherical bow shocks. We study the cosmic ray flux in and around lambda Cephei as an example for an astrosphere. The large-scale plasma flow is modeled hydrodynamically with radiative cooling. We studied the cosmic ray flux in a stellar wind cavity using a transport model based on stochastic differential equations. The required parameters, most importantly, the elements of the diffusion tensor, are based on the heliospheric parameters. The magnetic field required for the diffusion coefficients is calculated kinematically. We discuss the transport in an astrospheric scenario with varying parameters for the transport coefficients. We show that large stellar wind cavities can act as sinks for the galactic cosmic ray flux and thus can give rise to small-scale anisotropies in the direction to the observer.

From Discovery to the First Month of the Type II Supernova 2023ixf: High and Variable Mass Loss in the Final Year before Explosion,What is the mass of alpha Cen B b?,False,"We present the discovery of the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in M101 and follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations, respectively, in the first month and week of its evolution. Our discovery was made within a day of estimated first light, and the following light curve is characterized by a rapid rise ($\approx5$ days) to a luminous peak ($M_V\approx-18.2$ mag) and plateau ($M_V\approx-17.6$ mag) extending to $30$ days with a fast decline rate of $\approx0.03$ mag day$^{-1}$. During the rising phase, $U-V$ color shows blueward evolution, followed by redward evolution in the plateau phase. Prominent flash features of hydrogen, helium, carbon, and nitrogen dominate the spectra up to $\approx5$ days after first light, with a transition to a higher ionization state in the first $\approx2$ days. Both the $U-V$ color and flash ionization states suggest a rise in the temperature, indicative of a delayed shock breakout inside dense circumstellar material (CSM). From the timescales of CSM interaction, we estimate its compact radial extent of $\sim(3-7)\times10^{14}$ cm. We then construct numerical light-curve models based on both continuous and eruptive mass-loss scenarios shortly before explosion. For the continuous mass-loss scenario, we infer a range of mass-loss history with $0.1-1.0\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ in the final $2-1$ yr before explosion, with a potentially decreasing mass loss of $0.01-0.1\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ in $\sim0.7-0.4$ yr toward the explosion. For the eruptive mass-loss scenario, we favor eruptions releasing $0.3-1\,M_\odot$ of the envelope at about a year before explosion, which result in CSM with mass and extent similar to the continuous scenario. We discuss the implications of the available multiwavelength constraints obtained thus far on the progenitor candidate and SN 2023ixf to our variable CSM models.","We investigate the possibility of constraining the sin i degeneracy of alpha Cen B b -- with orbital period P=3.24 d; a = 0.042 AU; msini = 1.1 M_earth -- to estimate the true mass of the newly reported terrestrial exoplanet in the nearest stellar system to our Sun. We present detailed numerical simulations of the dynamical stability of the exoplanet in the alpha Cen AB binary system for a range of initial inclinations, eccentricities, and semi-major axes. The system represents a benchmark case for the interplay of the Kozai mechanism, general relativistic and tidal forces. From our simulations, there is only a small boundary in initial inclinations and initial semi-major axes that result in the migration via the Kozai mechanism of alpha Cen B b to its present location. Inside this boundary, the planet orbit is stable for up to 1 Gyr against the Kozai mechanism, and outside this boundary the planet collides with alpha Cen B or is ejected. In our three simulations where the planet migrates in towards the star via the Kozai mechanism, the final inclination is 46-53 degrees relative to the AB orbital plane, lower than the initial inclination of 75 degrees in each case. We discuss inclination constraints from the formation of alpha Cen B b in situ at its present location, migration in a proto-planetary disk, or migration in resonance with additional planets. We conclude that alpha Cen B b probably has a mass of less than 2.7 M_earth, implying a likely terrestrial composition warranting future confirmation.",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena,"High energy astrophysical phenomena focuses on cosmic ray production, acceleration, propagation, detection.

Thermodynamics of rotating quantum matter in the virial expansion,Tunnel junctions on as-grown superconducting MgB2 thin films,False,"We characterize the high-temperature thermodynamics of rotating bosons and fermions in two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic trapping potentials. We begin by calculating analytically the conventional virial coefficients $b_n$ for all $n$ in the noninteracting case, as functions of the trapping and rotational frequencies. We also report on the virial coefficients for the angular momentum and associated moment of inertia. Using the bn coefficients, we analyze the deconfined limit (in which the angular frequency matches the trapping frequency) and derive explicitly the limiting form of the partition function, showing from the thermodynamic standpoint how both the 2D and 3D cases become effectively homogeneous 2D systems. To tackle the virial coefficients in the presence of weak interactions, we implement a coarse temporal lattice approximation and obtain virial coefficients up to third order.","We demonstrate that good superconductor/insulator/normal-metal tunnel junctions can be fabricated on as-grown superconducting MgB2 thin films. The as-grown films were prepared by coevaporation at low growth temperatures of around 280deg. The insulating barrier was formed by an Mg overlayer, which is subsequently oxidized in air.

By taking advantage of tetrahedral tiling in the spatial discretization, we decrease the error and increase the reliability of the numerical method. An extensive survey of vortex splitting symmetries is presented for different aspect ratios of the harmonic trapping potential. The symmetries of the splitting patterns observed in the simulated dynamics are found to be in good agreement with predictions obtained by solving the dominant dynamical instabilities from the corresponding Bogoliubov equations. Furthermore, we observe intertwining of the split vortices in prolate condensates and a split-and-revival phenomenon in a spherical condensate.","We show that the isotope effect leads to a completely different spectroscopic signal in hydrogen-deuterium mixtures, compared to pure elements that have the same crystal structure. This is particularly true for molecular vibrations, which are the main source of information about the structure of high-pressure hydrogen. Mass disorder breaks translational symmetry, meaning that vibrations are localized almost to single molecules, and are not zone-center phonons. In mixtures, each observable IR peak corresponds to a collection of many such molecular vibrations, which have a distribution of frequencies depending on local environment. Furthermore discrete groups of environments cause the peaks to split. We illustrate this issue by considering the IR spectrum of the high pressure Phase III structure of hydrogen, recently interpreted as showing novel phases in isotopic mixtures. We calculate the IR spectrum of hydrogen/deuterium mixtures in the $C2/c$ and $Cmca$-12 structures, showing that isotopic disorder gives rise to mode localization of the high frequency vibrons. The local coordination of the molecules leads to discrete IR peaks. The spread of frequencies is strongly enhanced with pressure, such that more peaks become resolvable at higher pressures, in agreement with the recent measurements.",Quantum Gases,"Quantum gases in condensed matter physics focuses on ultracold atomic and molecular gases, Bose-Einstein condensation, Feshbach resonances, spinor condensates, optical lattices, quantum simulation with cold atoms and molecules, and macroscopic interference phenomena."
Direct and Inverse Cascades in the Acceleration Region of the Fast Solar Wind,Novel Silicon n-on-p Edgeless Planar Pixel Sensors for the ATLAS upgrade,False,"Alfv\'{e}n waves are believed to play an important role in the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind emanating from coronal holes. Nonlinear interactions between the dominant ${\bf z}_{+}$ waves and minority ${\bf z}_{-}$ waves have the potential to transfer wave energy either to smaller perpendicular scales (""direct cascade"") or to larger scales (""inverse cascade""). In this paper we use reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations to investigate how the cascade rates $\epsilon_{\pm}$ depend on perpendicular wavenumber and radial distance from Sun center. For models with a smooth background atmosphere we find that an inverse cascade ($\epsilon_{+} < 0$) occurs for the dominant waves at radii between 1.4 and 2.5 $R_\odot$ and dimensionless wavenumbers in the inertial range ($15 < a_\perp < 44$), and a direct cascade ($\epsilon_{+} > 0$) occurs elsewhere. For a model with density fluctuations there are multiple regions with inverse cascade. In both cases the cascade rate $\epsilon_{+}$ varies significantly with perpendicular wavenumber, indicating that the cacsade is a highly non-local process. As a result of the inverse cascades, the enery dissipation rates are much lower than expected from a phenomenological model, and are insufficient to maintain the temperature of the background atmosphere. We conclude that RMHD models are unable to reproduce the observed properties of the fast solar wind.","In view of the LHC upgrade phases towards HL-LHC, the ATLAS experiment plans to upgrade the Inner Detector with an all-silicon system. The n-on-p silicon technology is a promising candidate for the pixel upgrade thanks to its radiation hardness and cost effectiveness, that allow for enlarging the area instrumented with pixel detectors. We report on the development of novel n-in-p edgeless planar pixel sensors fabricated at FBK (Trento, Italy), making use of the ""active edge"" concept for the reduction of the dead area at the periphery of the device.

The Thresher: Lucky Imaging without the Waste,The alignment between brightest cluster galaxies and host clusters,False,"In traditional lucky imaging (TLI), many consecutive images of the same scene are taken with a high frame-rate camera, and all but the sharpest images are discarded before constructing the final shift-and-add image. Here we present an alternative image analysis pipeline -- The Thresher -- for these kinds of data, based on online multi-frame blind deconvolution. It makes use of all available data to obtain a best estimate of the astronomical scene in the context of reasonable computational limits; it does not require prior estimates of the point-spread functions in the images, or knowledge of point sources in the scene that could provide such estimates. Most importantly, the scene it aims to return is the optimum of a justified scalar objective based on the likelihood function. Because it uses the full set of images in the stack, The Thresher outperforms TLI in signal-to-noise; as it accounts for the individual-frame PSFs, it does this without loss of angular resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on both simulated data and real Electron-Multiplying CCD images obtained at the Danish 1.54m telescope (hosted by ESO, La Silla). We also explore the current limitations of the algorithm, and find that for the choice of image model presented here, non-linearities in flux are introduced into the returned scene. Ongoing development of the software can be viewed at https://github.com/jah1994/TheThresher.","The alignment between brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and host clusters can reveal the mystery of formation and evolution for galaxy clusters. We measure cluster orientations in optical based on the projected distribution of member galaxies and in X-ray by fitting the morphology of intra-cluster medium (ICM). Cluster orientations determined in the two wavelengths are generally consistent. The orientation alignment between BCGs and host clusters is confirmed and more significant than previous works. We find that BCGs are more aligned with cluster orientations measured in X-ray than those from optical data. Clusters with a brighter BCG generally show a stronger alignment. We argue that the detected redshift evolution of the alignment is probably caused by observational bias rather than intrinsic evolution. The alignment is not related to the ellipticity of BCGs, and the richness, ellipticity and dynamical state of host clusters. The strong alignment between BCGs and morphology of ICMs may be the consequence of the co-evolution between the central massive galaxy and host clusters.",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics,"Instrumentation and methods for astrophysics focuses on detector and telescope design, experiment proposals.

We describe the properties of active turbulence as momentum propagation is screened by frictional damping. As friction is increased, the spacing between the walls in the nematic director field decreases as a consequence of the more rapid velocity decays.

Highly efficient parallel grand canonical simulations of interstitial-driven deformation-diffusion processes,Mathematics of nerve signals,False,"Diffusion of interstitial alloying elements like H, O, C, and N in metals and their continuous relocation and interactions with their microstructures have crucial influences on metals properties. However, besides limitations in experimental tools in capturing these mechanisms, the inefficiency of numerical tools also inhibits modeling efforts. Here, we present an efficient framework to perform hybrid grand canonical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations that allow for parallel insertion/deletion of Monte Carlo moves. A new methodology for calculation of the energy difference at trial moves that can be applied to many-body potentials as well as pair ones is a primary feature of our implementation. We study H diffusion in Fe (ferrite phase) and Ni polycrystalline samples to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the algorithm and its application.

"Comment on ""Validity of Einstein Relation in Disordered Organic Semiconductors""",Critical Behavior and Anisotropy in Single Crystal SrRuO$_3$,False,"Wetzelaer, Koster, and Blom [PRL 107, 066605] recently observed that the classic Einstein relation $\frac{D}{\mu}=\frac{kT}{q}$ is still valid in disordered semiconductors in thermal(quasi)equilibrium by studying the diffusion-driven currents of single-carrier diodes. This is in contrast to the previous theoretical prediction [2] and experiment observation from Leo et.al. [3] where the Einstein relation increases with 1/T.

The effect of a small magnetic flux on the metal-insulator transition,Local photodoping in monolayer MoS2,False,"We numerically show that very small magnetic flux can significantly shift the metal-insulator transition point in a disordered electronic system. The shift we observe for the 3d Anderson model obeys a power law as predicted by Larkin and Khmel'nitskii (1981). We compute the exponent and find good agreement with the prediction. However, the power law holds only for much smaller magnetic fields than has been previously assumed, and is accompanied by a large prefactor, leading to a surprising strong dependence of the transition point on the applied magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that the critical level-spacing distribution is identical in the presence and absence of a magnetic field if hard-wall boundary conditions are applied. This result is surprising since both cases belong to different universality classes and different distributions have been reported for periodic boundary conditions.","Inducing electrostatic doping in 2D materials by laser exposure (photodoping effect) is an exciting route to tune optoelectronic phenomena. However, there is a lack of investigation concerning in what respect the action of photodoping in optoelectronic devices is local. Here, we employ scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) techniques to investigate how a permanent photodoping modulates the photocurrent generation in MoS2 transistors locally. We claim that the photodoping fills the electronic states in MoS2 conduction band, preventing the photon-absorption and the photocurrent generation by the MoS2 sheet. Moreover, by comparing the persistent photocurrent (PPC) generation of MoS2 on top of different substrates, we elucidate that the interface between the material used for the gate and the insulator (gate-insulator interface) is essential for the photodoping generation.

Imaging and Modeling Data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array,"A ${\bf 1.4}$ deg${\bf ^2}$ blind survey for CII], CIII] and CIV at ${\bf z\sim0.7-1.5}$. I: nature, morphologies and equivalent widths",False,"We analyze data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array. This is the third in a series of papers on the closure phase delay-spectrum technique designed to detect the HI 21cm emission from cosmic reionization. We present the details of the data and models employed in the power spectral analysis, and discuss limitations to the process. We compare images and visibility spectra made with HERA data, to parallel quantities generated from sky models based on the GLEAM survey, incorporating the HERA telescope model. We find reasonable agreement between images made from HERA data, with those generated from the models, down to the confusion level. For the visibility spectra, there is broad agreement between model and data across the full band of $\sim 80$MHz. However, models with only GLEAM sources do not reproduce a roughly sinusoidal spectral structure at the tens of percent level seen in the observed visibility spectra on scales $\sim 10$ MHz on 29 m baselines. We find that this structure is likely due to diffuse Galactic emission, predominantly the Galactic plane, filling the far sidelobes of the antenna primary beam. We show that our current knowledge of the frequency dependence of the diffuse sky radio emission, and the primary beam at large zenith angles, is inadequate to provide an accurate reproduction of the diffuse structure in the models. We discuss implications due to this missing structure in the models, including calibration, and in the search for the HI 21cm signal, as well as possible mitigation techniques.","While traditionally associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN), the properties of the CII] ($\lambda=2326$\,{\AA}), CIII] ($\lambda,\lambda=1907,1909$\,{\AA}) and CIV ($\lambda,\lambda=1549, 1551$\,{\AA}) emission lines are still uncertain as large, unbiased samples of sources are scarce.

Bright CII] emitters have individual X-ray detections as well as high average black hole accretion rates (BHAR) of $\sim0.1$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

Transverse-momentum and event-shape dependence of D-meson flow harmonics in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV,Skyrme Hartree-Fock Calculations for the Alpha Decay Q Values of Super-Heavy Nuclei,False,"The elliptic and triangular flow coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ of prompt D$^{0}$, D$^{+}$, and D$^{*+}$ mesons were measured at midrapidity ($|y|<0.8$) in Pb-Pb collisions at the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The D mesons were reconstructed via their hadronic decays in the transverse momentum interval $1< p_{\rm T}<36$ GeV/$c$ in central (0-10%) and semi-central (30-50%) collisions. Compared to pions, protons, and J/$\psi$ mesons, the average D-meson $v_{n}$ harmonics are compatible within uncertainties with a mass hierarchy for $p_{\rm T} \lesssim 3$ GeV/$c$, and are similar to those of charged pions for higher $p_{\rm T}$. The coupling of the charm quark to the light quarks in the underlying medium is further investigated with the application of the event-shape engineering (ESE) technique to the D-meson $v_2$ and $p_{\rm T}$-differential yields. The D-meson $v_2$ is correlated with average bulk elliptic flow in both central and semi-central collisions. Within the current precision, the ratios of per-event D-meson yields in the ESE-selected and unbiased samples are found to be compatible with unity.

Interfaces in driven Ising models: shear enhances confinement,Antipersistant Effects in the Dynamics of a Competing Population,False,"We use a phase-separated driven two-dimensional Ising lattice gas to study fluid interfaces exposed to shear flow parallel to the interface. The interface is stabilized by two parallel walls with opposing surface fields and a driving field parallel to the walls is applied which (i) either acts locally at the walls or (ii) varies linearly with distance across the strip. Using computer simulations with Kawasaki dynamics, we find that the system reaches a steady state in which the magnetisation profile is the same as that in equilibrium, but with a rescaled length implying a reduction of the interfacial width. An analogous effect was recently observed in sheared phase-separated colloidal dispersions. Pair correlation functions along the interface decay more rapidly with distance under drive than in equilibrium and for cases of weak drive can be rescaled to the equilibrium result.","We consider a population of agents competing for finite resources using strategies based on two channels of signals. The model is applicable to financial markets, ecosystems and computer networks. We find that the dynamics of the system is determined by the correlation between the two channels. In particular, occasional mismatches of the signals induce a series of transitions among numerous attractors. Surprisingly, in contrast to the effects of noises on dynamical systems normally resulting in a large number of attractors, the number of attractors due to the mismatched signals remains finite. Both simulations and analyses show that this can be explained by the antipersistent nature of the dynamics. Antipersistence refers to the response of the system to a given signal being opposite to that of the signal's previous occurrence, and is a consequence of the competition of the agents to make minority decisions. Thus, it is essential for stabilizing the dynamical systems.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Gravitational waves induced by spinor fields,Can brown dwarfs survive on close orbits around convective stars?,False,"In realistic model-building, spinor fields with various masses are present. During inflation, spinor field may induce gravitational waves as a second order effect. In this paper, we calculate the contribution of single massive spinor field to the power spectrum of primordial gravitational wave by using retarded Green propagator. We find that the correction is scale-invariant and of order $H^4/M_P^4$ for arbitrary spinor mass $m_{\psi}$. Additionally, we also observe that when $m_\psi \gtrsim H$, the dependence of correction on $m_\psi/H$ is nontrivial.","Brown dwarfs straddle the mass range transition from planetary to stellar objects. There is a relative paucity of brown dwarfs companions around FGKM stars compared to exoplanets for orbital periods less than a few years, but most of the short-period brown dwarf companions fully characterised by transits and radial velocities are found around F-type stars. We examine the hypothesis that brown dwarf companions could not survive on close orbit around stars with important convective envelopes because the tides and angular momentum loss through magnetic breaking should lead to a rapid orbital decay and quick engulfment of the companion. We use a classical Skumanich-type braking law, and constant time-lag tidal theory to assess the characteristic timescale for orbital decay for the brown dwarf mass range as a function of the host properties. We find that F-type stars may host massive companions for a significantly longer time than G-type stars for a given orbital period, which may explain the paucity of G-type hosts for brown dwarfs with orbital period less than 5 days. On the other hand, we show that the small radius of early M-type stars contributes to orbital decay timescales that are only half those of F-type stars, despite their more efficient tidal dissipation and magnetic braking. For fully convective later type M-dwarfs, orbital decay timescales could be orders of magnitude greater than for F-type stars. For orbital periods greater than 10 days, brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by tidal decay, whatever the mass of the host. On closer orbital periods, the rapid engulfment of massive companions could explain the lack of G and K-type hosts in the sample of known systems with transiting brown dwarfs. However, the paucity of M-type hosts can not be an effect of tidal decay alone, but may be the result of a selection effect in the sample and/or the formation mechanism.",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics focuses on phenomenology of early universe, cosmic microwave background, cosmological parameters, primordial element abundances, extragalactic distance scale, and large-scale structure of the universe.

Propagator mixing renormalization for Majorana fermions,Closed String Tachyons and Their Implications for Non-Supersymmetric Strings,False,"We consider a mixed system of unstable Majorana fermions in a general parity-nonconserving theory and renormalize its propagator matrix to all orders in the pole scheme, in which the squares of the renormalized masses are identified with the complex pole positions and the wave-function renormalization (WFR) matrices are adjusted in compliance with the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formalism. In contrast to the case of unstable Dirac fermions, the WFR matrices of the in and out states are uniquely fixed, while they again bifurcate in the sense that they are no longer related by pseudo-Hermitian conjugation. We present closed analytic expressions for the renormalization constants in terms of the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and pseudovector parts of the unrenormalized self-energy matrix, which is computable from the one-particle-irreducible Feynman diagrams of the flavor transitions, as well as their expansions through two loops.

Our study reveals that, surprisingly, the number of bundles is independent of the number of flagella, and the formation of three bundles is always the most frequent case. We assume that this relates to the fact that different mutants have the same body length. There is no significant difference between the bundle width and length for distinct strains, but the projected angle between the bundles increases with the flagellar number. Furthermore, we find that the swimming speed is anti-correlated with the projected angle between the bundles, and the wobbling angle between the swimming direction and cell body increases with the number of flagella.

An efficient method for computing the Thouless-Valatin inertia parameters,Is early thermalization achieved only near midrapidity at RHIC ?,False,"Starting from the adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation (ATDHF), we propose an efficient method to calculate the Thouless-Valatin moments of inertia for the nuclear system.

Next, by using these hydrodynamic simulations, we compare elliptic flow as a function of pseudorapidity with experimental data recently measured by the PHOBOS Collaboration.

For the same settings but at an only slightly higher electron temperature, the measured backscattered charges were q=e/3, q=e/5, and q=e/7. In other words, bunching of backscattered quasiparticles is taking place at sufficiently low temperatures. Moreover, the backscattered current exhibited distinct temperature dependence that was correlated to the backscattered charge and the filling factor. This observation suggests the existence of 'low' and 'high' temperature backscattering states, each with its characteristic charge and characteristic energy.","The leading order ""temperature"" of a dense two dimensional granular material fluidised by external vibrations is determined. An asymptotic solution is obtained where the particles are considered to be elastic in the leading approximation. The velocity distribution is a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the leading approximation. The density profile is determined by solving the momentum balance equation in the vertical direction, where the relation between the pressure and density is provided by the virial equation of state. The predictions of the present analysis show good agreement with simulation results at higher densities where theories for a dilute vibrated granular material, with the pressure-density relation provided by the ideal gas law, are in error. The theory also predicts the scaling relations of the total dissipation in the bed reported by McNamara and Luding (PRE v 58, p 813).",Strongly Correlated Electrons,"Strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter physics focuses on systems where interactions between electrons are so strong that they cannot be described adequately by non-interacting models.

"Primary versus secondary gamma intensities in 171Yb(n_th,gamma)",Effect of finite particle number sampling on baryon number fluctuations,False,"The two published literature values [Greenwood et al., Nucl. Phys. A252, 260 (1975) and Gelletly et al., J. Phys. G 11, 1055 (1985)] for absolute primary gamma intensities following thermal neutron capture of 171Yb differ in average by a factor of three. We have resolved this conflict in favor of Greenwood et al. by a measurement of primary versus secondary intensities.","The effects of finite particle number sampling on the net baryon number cumulants, extracted from fluid dynamical simulations, are studied. The commonly used finite particle number sampling procedure introduces an additional Poissonian (or multinomial if global baryon number conservation is enforced) contribution which increases the extracted moments of the baryon number distribution. If this procedure is applied to a fluctuating fluid dynamics framework one severely overestimates the actual cumulants. We show that the sampling of so called test-particles suppresses the additional contribution to the moments by at least one power of the number of test-particles. We demonstrate this method in a numerical fluid dynamics simulation that includes the effects of spinodal decomposition due to a first order phase transition. Furthermore, in the limit where anti-baryons can be ignored, we derive analytic formulas which capture exactly the effect of particle sampling on the baryon number cumulants. These formulas may be used to test the various numerical particle sampling algorithms.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Operation of the jet feedback mechanism (JFM) in intermediate luminosity optical transients (ILOTs),A Stringy Mechanism for A Small Cosmological Constant - Multi-Moduli Cases -,False,"We follow the premise that most intermediate luminosity optical transients (ILOTs) are powered by rapid mass accretion onto a main sequence star, and study the effects of jets launched by an accretion disk. The disk is formed due to large specific angular momentum of the accreted mass. The two opposite jets might expel some of the mass from the reservoir of gas that feeds the disk, and therefore reduces and shortens the mass accretion process. We argue that by this process ILOTs limit their luminosity and might even shut themselves off in this negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). The group of ILOTs is a new member of a large family of astrophysical objects whose activity is regulated by the operation of the JFM.","Based on the properties of probability distributions of functions of random variables, we proposed earlier a simple stringy mechanism that prefers the meta-stable vacua with a small cosmological constant \Lambda. As an illustration of this approach, we study in this paper particularly simple but non-trivial models of the K\""ahler uplift in the large volume flux compactification scenario in Type IIB string theory, where all parameters introduced in the model are treated either as fixed constants motivated by physics, or as random variables with some given uniform probability distributions. We determine the value w_0 of the superpotential W_0 at the supersymmetric minima, and find that the resulting probability distribution P(w_0) peaks at w_0=0; furthermore, this peaking behavior strengthens as the number of complex structure moduli increases. The resulting probability distribution P(\Lambda) for meta-stable vacua also peaks as \Lambda -> 0, for both positive and negative \Lambda. This peaking/divergent behavior of P(\Lambda) strengthens as the number of moduli increases. In some scenarios for \Lambda > 0, the likely value of \Lambda decreases exponentially as the number of moduli increases.

Tuning Self Organization Of Confined Active Particles By Steepness Of The Trap,Evaluating and improving the cluster variation method entropy functional for Ising alloys,False,"We consider collective dynamics of self-propelling particles in two dimensions. They can align themselves according to the direction of propulsion of their neighbours, together with a random perturbation (i.e. rotational fluctuation). They are also interacting with each other by a soft, isotropic, excluded-volume interaction. Particles are confined in a circular trap. The steepness of the trap is tuneable. Their average packing fraction and strength of rotational fluctuation are low. When the trap is steep, particles flock along its boundary. They form polar cluster that spreads over the boundary. The cluster has no spatial or structural order. We show, when the steepness is decreased beyond a threshold value, the clusters become round, compact and eventually spatial order (hexagonal) emerges in addition to the pre-established polar order within them. We investigate kinetics of such ordering. We find that while rotating around the centre of the trap along its circular boundary, the clusters need to roll around their centre of mass, to be spatially ordered. We also discuss the stability of the order when the trap is suddenly switched off.","The success of the ""Cluster Variation Method"" (CVM) in reproducing quite accurately the free energies of Monte Carlo (MC) calculations on Ising models is explained in terms of identifying a cancellation of errors: We show that the CVM produces correlation functions that are too close to zero, which leads to an overestimation of the exact energy, E, and at the same time, to an underestimation of -TS, so the free energy F=E-TS is more accurate than either of its parts. This insight explains a problem with ""hybrid methods"" using MC correlation functions in the CVM entropy expression: They give exact energies E and do not give significantly improved -TS relative to CVM, so they do not benefit from the above noted cancellation of errors. Additionally, ""hybrid methods"" suffer from the difficulty of adequately accounting for both ordered and disordered phases in a consistent way. A different technique, the ""Entropic Monte Carlo"" (EMC), is shown here to provide a means for critically evaluating the CVM entropy. Inspired by EMC results, we find a universal and simple correction to the CVM entropy which produces individual components of the free energy with MC accuracy, but is computationally much less expensive than either MC thermodynamic integration or EMC.",Soft Condensed Matter,"Soft condensed matter in physics focuses on the study of materials that are easily deformable by external fields or internal stresses.

Stable Charged Antiparallel Domain Walls in Hyperferroelectrics,Analytical Calculation of Four-Point Correlations for a Simple Model of Cages Involving Numerous Particles,False,"Charge-neutral 180$^\circ$ domain walls that separate domains of antiparallel polarization directions are common structural topological defects in ferroelectrics. In normal ferroelectrics, charged 180$^\circ$ domain walls running perpendicular to the polarization directions are highly energetically unfavorable because of the depolarization field and are difficult to stabilize. We explore both neutral and charged 180$^\circ$ domain walls in hyperferroelectrics, a class of proper ferroelectrics with persistent polarization in the presence of a depolarization field, using density functional theory. We obtain zero temperature equilibrium structures of head-to-head and tail-to-tail walls in recently discovered $ABC$-type hexagonal hyperferroelectrics. Charged domain walls can also be stabilized in canonical ferroelectrics represented by LiNbO$_3$ without any dopants, defects or mechanical clamping. First-principles electronic structure calculations show that charged domain walls can reduce and even close the band gap of host materials and support quasi-two-dimensional electron(hole) gas with enhanced electrical conductivity.","Dynamics of a one-dimensional system of Brownian particles with short-range repulsive interaction (diameter sigma) is studied with a liquid-theoretical approach. The mean square displacement, the two-particle displacement correlation, and the overlap-density-based generalized susceptibility are calculated analytically by way of the Lagrangian correlation of the interparticulate space, instead of the Eulerian correlation of density that is commonly used in the standard mode-coupling theory. In regard to the mean square displacement, the linear analysis reproduces the established result on the asymptotic subdiffusive behavior of the system. A finite-time correction is given by incorporating the effect of entropic nonlinearity with a Lagrangian version of mode-coupling theory. The notorious difficulty in derivation of the mode-coupling theory concerning violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is found to disappear by virtue of the Lagrangian description. The Lagrangian description also facilitates analytical calculation of four-point correlations in the space-time, such as the two-particle displacement correlation. The two-particle displacement correlation, which is asymptotically self-similar in the space-time, illustrates how the cage effect confines each particle within a short radius on one hand and creates collective motion of numerous particles on the other hand. As the time elapses, the correlation length grows unlimitedly, and the generalized susceptibility based on the overlap density converges to a finite value which is an increasing function of the density. The distribution function behind these dynamical four-point correlations and its extension to three-dimensional cases, respecting the tensorial character of the two-particle displacement correlation, are also discussed.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

The relativistic Doppler effect: when a zero frequency shift or a red shift exists for sources approaching the observer,Vertical Displacement Events in Shaped Tokamaks,False,"It is shown without making use of Lorentz transformation that there exists a phenomenon of relativistic zero-frequency shift in Doppler effect for a plane wave in free space, observed in two inertial frames of relative motion, and the zero shift takes place at a maximum aberration of light. When it is applied to analysis of a moving point light source, two unconventional physical implications result: (1) a light source, when it is approaching (moving closer to) the observer, may cause a red shift; (2) a zero-frequency-shift observation does not necessarily mean that the light source is not moving closer, and in contrast, the light source may be moving closer to the observer at a high speed. This fundamental result of special relativity may provide an alternative way to experimentally examine the principle of relativity, and might have a significant application in astrophysics.","Computational studies of vertical displacement events (VDE's) in shaped tokamaks are presented. The calculations are performed with our nonlinear, 3D resistive MHD code, CTD, which can efficiently treat resistive walls and free boundary displacements in moderately-shaped geometries.

Second, the coupling between an n=0 vertical instability and an n=1 external kink mode is examined to offer a possible explanation for the nonuniformities observed in the poloidal halo currents during VDE's, and the forces generated by them on the plasma-facing components. Finally, effects of a rotating liquid metal wall on the equilibrium and n=0 stability of elongated plasmas are briefly discussed.",General Physics,"General physics focuses on multidisciplinary topics, speculative ideas, and proposals that cover more than one area of physics.

The link between North Atlantic tropical cyclones and ENSO in seasonal forecasts,UV Exposed Optical Fibers with Frequency Domain Reflectometry for Device Tracking in Intra-Arterial Procedures,False,"This study assesses the ability of six European seasonal forecast models to simulate the observed teleconnection between ENSO and tropical cyclones (TCs) over the North Atlantic. While the models generally capture the basin-wide observed link, its magnitude is overestimated in all forecast models compared to reanalysis. Furthermore, the ENSO - TC relationship in the Caribbean is poorly simulated. It is shown that incorrect forecasting of wind shear appears to affect the representation of the teleconnection in some models, however it is not a completely sufficient explanation for the overestimation of the link.","Shape tracking of medical devices using strain sensing properties in optical fibers has seen increased attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel guidance system for intra-arterial procedures using a distributed strain sensing device based on optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) to track the shape of a catheter. Tracking enhancement is provided by exposing a fiber triplet to a focused ultraviolet beam, producing high scattering properties. Contrary to typical quasi-distributed strain sensors, we propose a truly distributed strain sensing approach, which allows to reconstruct a fiber triplet in real-time. A 3D roadmap of the hepatic anatomy integrated with a 4D MR imaging sequence allows to navigate the catheter within the pre-interventional anatomy, and map the blood flow velocities in the arterial tree. We employed Riemannian anisotropic heat kernels to map the sensed data to the pre-interventional model. Experiments in synthetic phantoms and an in vivo model are presented. Results show that the tracking accuracy is suitable for interventional tracking applications, with a mean 3D shape reconstruction errors of 1.6 +/- 0.3 mm.

Generation of intermediately-long sea waves by weakly sheared winds,A versatile method to generate multiple types of micropatterns,False,"The present study concerns the numerical modeling of sea-wave instability under the effect of logarithmic-wind profile in hurricane conditions. The central point of the study is the calculation of the wave growth rate, which is proportional to the fractional input energy from the weakly-sheared (logarithmic) wind to the wave exponentially varying with time. It is shown for hurricane conditions that the Miles-type stability model based on the Charnock's formula with the standard constant coefficient underestimates the growth rate ~5 to 50 times as compared with the model employing the roughness adopted from experimental data for hurricane winds. The drag reduction with wind speed at hurricane conditions coupled with the similar behavior of the dimensionless gravity acceleration, leads to the minimum in the maximal growth rate and the maximum in the most unstable wavelength.","Micropatterning techniques have become an important tool for the study of cell behavior in controlled microenvironments. As a consequence, several approaches for the creation of micropatterns have been developed in recent years. However, the diversity of substrates, coatings and complex patterns used in cell science is so great that no single existing technique is capable of fabricating designs suitable for all experimental conditions. Hence, there is a need for patterning protocols that are flexible with regard to the materials used and compatible with different patterning strategies to create more elaborate setups. In this work, we present a versatile approach to micropatterning. The protocol is based on plasma treatment, protein coating, and a PLL-PEG backfill step, and produces homogeneous patterns on a variety of substrates. Protein density within the patterns can be controlled, and density gradients of surface-bound protein can be formed. Moreover, by combining the method with microcontact printing, it is possible to generate patterns composed of three different components within one iteration of the protocol. The technique is simple to implement and should enable cell science labs to create a broad range of complex and highly specialized microenvironments.",Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics,"Atmospheric and oceanic physics focuses on the physical processes occurring in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

Measurement of the Negative Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment to 0.7 ppm,Generalized Landen Transformation Formulas for Jacobi Elliptic Functions,False,"The anomalous magnetic moment of the negative muon has been measured to a precision of 0.7 parts per million (ppm) at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron. This result is based on data collected in 2001, and is over an order of magnitude more precise than the previous measurement of the negative muon. The result a_mu= 11 659 214(8)(3) \times 10^{-10} (0.7 ppm), where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is sytematic, is consistend with previous measurements of the anomaly for the positive and negative muon.

We find that several of our Landen transformations have a rather different and substantially more elegant appearance compared to the forms usually found in the literature. Further, by making use of the cyclic identities discovered recently, we also obtain some entirely new sets of Landen transformations.

Surface ferromagnetism in a chiral topological semimetal CoSi,Non-Gaussian fluctuations of a probe coupled to a Gaussian field,False,"Despite the chiral topological semimetal CoSi is known as bulk diamagnetic, it shows unusual surface ferromagnetism of debatable origin. The ferromagnetic ordering has been attributed to the distorted bonds, the superlattice of ordered vacancies, or even to topological surface textures due to the spin polarization in the neighboring Fermi arcs. We experimentally compare magnetization reversal curves for initially oxidized CoSi single crystals and cleaved samples with a fresh, oxide-free surface. While the oxidized CoSi samples do not show sizable ferromagnetism, the fresh CoSi surface gives a strong ferromagnetic response, which is accompanied by the pronounced modulation of the angle dependence of magnetization, as it can be expected for easy and hard axes in a ferromagnet. In addition to the first order reversal curves analysis, this observation allows us to distinguish between different mechanisms of the ferromagnetic ordering in CoSi single crystals. We conclude that the surface states-induced RKKY interaction between distorted bonds near the sample surface is responsible for the strong ferromagnetic multi-domain behavior for freshly cleaved samples.","The motion of a colloidal probe in a complex fluid, such as a micellar solution, is usually described by the generalized Langevin equation, which is linear. However, recent numerical simulations and experiments have shown that this linear model fails when the probe is confined, and that the intrinsic dynamics of the probe is actually non-linear. Noting that the kurtosis of the displacement of the probe may reveal the non-linearity of its dynamics also in the absence confinement, we compute it for a probe coupled to a Gaussian field and possibly trapped by a harmonic potential. We show that the excess kurtosis increases from zero at short times, reaches a maximum, and then decays algebraically at long times, with an exponent which depends on the spatial dimensionality and on the features and correlations of the dynamics of the field.

Simple absorbing boundary conditions for wave simulations with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics,Probing the basis set limit for thermochemical contributions of inner-shell correlation: Balance of core-core and core-valence contributions,False,"We study and implement a simple method, based on the Perfectly Matched Layer approach, to treat non reflecting boundary conditions with the Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics numerical algorithm. The method is based on the concept of physical damping. We illustrate how it works in the case of 1D and 2D time dependent waves propagating in a finite domain.","The inner-shell correlation contributions to the total atomization energies (TAEs) of the W4-17 computational thermochemistry benchmark have been determined at the CCSD(T) level near the basis set limit using several families of core correlation basis sets, such as aug-cc-pCVnZ (n=3-6), aug-cc-pwCVnZ (n=3-5), and nZaPa-CV (n=3-5). The three families of basis sets agree very well with each other (0.01 kcal/mol RMS) when extrapolating from the two largest available basis sets: however, there are considerable differences in convergence behavior for the smaller basis sets. nZaPa-CV is superior for the core-core term and awCVnZ for the core-valence term. While the aug-cc-pwCV(T+d)Z basis set of Yockel and Wilson is superior to aug-cc-pwCVTZ, further extension of this family proved unproductive. The best compromise between accuracy and computational cost, in the context of high-accuracy computational thermochemistry methods such as W4 theory, is CCSD(T)/awCV{T,Q}Z, where the {T,Q} notation stands for extrapolation from the awCVTZ and awCVQZ basis set pair. For lower-cost calculations, a previously proposed combination of CCSD-F12b/cc-pCVTZ-F12 and CCSD(T)/pwCVTZ(no f) appears to 'give the best bang for the buck'. While core-valence correlation accounts for the lion's share of the inner shell contribution in first-row molecules, for second-row molecules core-core contributions may become important, particularly in systems like P4 and S4 with multiple adjacent second-row atoms.

Floquet edge solitons in modulated trimer waveguide arrays,Sublattice synchronization of chaotic networks with delayed couplings,False,"We show that one-dimensional Floquet trimer arrays with periodically oscillating waveguides support two different and co-existing types of topological Floquet edge states in two different topological gaps in Floquet spectrum. In these systems nontrivial topology is introduced by longitudinal periodic oscillations of the waveguide centers, leading to the formation of Floquet edge states in certain range of oscillation amplitudes despite the fact that the structure spends half of the period in ``instantaneously'' nontopological phase, and only during other half-period it is ``instantaneously'' topological. Two co-existing Floquet edge states are characterized by different phase relations between bright spots in the unit cell -- in one mode these spots are in-phase, while in other mode they are out-of-phase. We show that in focusing nonlinear medium topological Floquet edge solitons, representing exactly periodic nonlinear localized Floquet states, can bifurcate from both these types of linear edge states. Both types of Floquet edge solitons can be stable and can be created dynamically using two-site excitations.","Synchronization of chaotic units coupled by their time delayed variables are investigated analytically. A new type of cooperative behavior is found: sublattice synchronization. Although the units of one sublattice are not directly coupled to each other, they completely synchronize without time delay.

Nevertheless, the trajectory of one sublattice is predictable from the complete trajectory of the other one.

The collapse transition on superhydrophobic surfaces,Magnetic resonance studies of the fundamental spin-wave modes in individual submicron Cu/NiFe/Cu perpendicularly magnetized disks,False,"We investigate the transition between the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states of a slowly evaporating, micron-scale drop on a superhydrophobic surface. In two dimensions analytical results show that there are two collapse mechanisms. For long posts the drop collapses when it is able to overcome the free energy barrier presented by the hydrophobic posts. For short posts, as the drop loses volume, its curvature increases allowing it to touch the surface below the posts. We emphasise the importance of the contact line retreating across the surface as the drop becomes smaller: this often preempts the collapse. In a quasi-three dimensional simulation we find similar behaviour, with the additional feature that the drop can de-pin from all but the peripheral posts, so that its base resembles an inverted bowl.","Spin wave spectra of perpendicularly magnetized disks with trilayers consisting of a 100 nm permalloy (Py) layer sandwiched by two Cu layers of 30 nm, are measured individually with a Magnetic Resonance Force Microscope (MRFM).

Stabilization of two-dimensional solitons in cubic-saturable nonlinear lattices,Synchronization in networks of mobile oscillators,False,"We consider soliton dynamics and stability in a nonlinear lattice formed by alternating domains with focusing cubic and saturable nonlinearities. We find that in such lattices solitons centered on cubic domains may be stabilized even in two-dimensional geometries, in spite of their intrinsic catastrophic instability in the absence of the lattice. Solitons centered on saturable domains are always unstable.","We present a model of synchronization in networks of autonomous agents where the topology changes due to agents motion. We introduce two time scales, one for the topological change and another one for local synchronization. If the former scale is much shorter, an approximation that averages out the effect of motion is available. Here we show, however, that the time required for synchronization achievement increases with respect to that approximation in the opposite case. We find that this effect is more important close to the continuum percolation transition point. The simulation results are confirmed by means of spectral analysis of the time dependent Laplacian matrix. Our results show that the trade-off between these two time scales, which have opposite effects on synchronization, should be taken into account for the design of mobile device networks.",Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Out-of-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics in the Bloch sphere: temperature and internal entropy production,Towards Pair Atomic Density Fitting for Correlation Energies with Benchmark Accuracy,False,"An explicit expression for the temperature of an open two-level quantum system is obtained as a function of local properties, under the hypothesis of weak interaction with the environment. This temperature is defined for both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium states, and coincides with the environment temperature if the system reaches thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir. Additionally, we show that within this theoretical framework the total entropy production can be partitioned into two contributions: one due to heat transfer, and another, associated to internal irreversibilities, related to the loss of internal coherence by the qubit. The positiveness of the heat capacity is established, as well as its consistency with the well known results at thermal equilibrium. We apply these concepts to two different systems, and show that they behave in analogous ways as their classical counterparts.","Pair atomic density fitting (PADF) is a promising strategy to reduce the scaling with system size of quantum chemical methods for the calculation of the correlation energy like the direct random phase approximation (RPA) or second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). PADF can however introduce large errors in correlation energies as the two-electron interaction energy is not guaranteed to be bounded from below. This issue can be partially alleviated by using very large fit sets, but this comes at the price of reduced efficiency and having to deal with near-linear dependencies in the fit set. In this work, we introduce an alternative methodology to overcome this problem that preserves the intrinsically favourable scaling of PADF. We first regularize the Fock matrix by projecting out parts of the basis set which gives rise to orbital products that are hard to describe by PADF. We then also apply this projector to the orbital coefficient matrix to improve the precision of PADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA. We systematically assess the accuracy of this new approach in a numerical atomic orbital framework using Slater Type Orbitals (STO) and correlation consistent Gaussian type basis sets up to quintuple-$\zeta$ quality for systems with more than 200 atoms. For the small and medium systems in the S66 database we show the maximum deviation of PADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA relative correlation energies to DF-MP2 and DF-RPA reference results to be 0.07 and 0.14 kcal/mol respectively. When the new projector method is used, the errors only slightly increase for large molecules and also when moderately sized fit sets are used the resulting errors are well under control.

Study of the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation for Mass-Scaling of Cold Collision Properties,Mapping the energy surface of PbTiO3 in multidimensional electric-displacement space,False,"Asymptotic levels of the A $^1\Sigma_u^+$ state of the two isotopomers $^{39}{\rm K}_2$ and $^{39}{\rm K}^{41}{\rm K}$ up to the dissociation limit are investigated with a Doppler-free high resolution laser-spectroscopic experiment in a molecular beam. The observed level structure can be reproduced correctly only if a mass dependent correction term is introduced for the interaction potential. The applied relative correction in the depth of the potential is $10^{-6}$, which is in the order of magnitude expected for corrections of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. A similar change in ground state potentials might lead to significant changes of mass-scaled properties describing cold collisions like the s-wave scattering length.","In recent years, methods have been developed that allow first-principles electronic-structure calculations to be carried out under conditions of fixed electric field. For some purposes, however, it is more convenient to work at fixed electric displacement field. Initial implementations of the fixed-displacement-field approach have been limited to constraining the field along one spatial dimension only. Here, we generalize this approach to treat the full three-dimensional displacement field as a constraint, and compute the internal-energy landscape as a function of this multidimensional displacement-field vector. Using PbTiO3 as a prototypical system, we identify stable or metastable tetragonal, orthorhombic and rhombohedral structures as the displacement field evolves along [001], [110] and [111] directions, respectively. The energy minimum along [001] is found to be deeper than that along [110] or [111], as expected for a system having a tetragonal ground state. The barriers connecting these minima are found to be quite small, consistent with the current understanding that the large piezoelectric effects in PbTiO3 arise from the easy rotation of the polarization vector.",Other Condensed Matter,Other condensed matter in physics focuses on topics that fall outside the scope of more specific categories.
Stationary and oscillatory bound states of dissipative solitons created by the third-order dispersion,On a method for constructing the Lax pairs for integrable models via quadratic ansatz,False,"We consider the model of fiber-laser cavities near the zero-dispersion point, based on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with the cubic-quintic nonlinearity, including the third-order dispersion (TOD) term. It is well known that this model supports stable dissipative solitons. We demonstrate that the same model gives rise to several families of robust bound states of the solitons, which exists only in the presence of the TOD. There are both stationary and dynamical bound states, with oscillating separation between the bound solitons. Stationary states are multistable, corresponding to different values of the separation. With the increase of the TOD coefficient, the bound state with the smallest separation gives rise the oscillatory state through the Hopf bifurcation. Further growth of TOD leads to a bifurcation transforming the oscillatory limit cycle into a strange attractor, which represents a chaotically oscillating dynamical bound state. Families of multistable three- and four-soliton complexes are found too, the ones with the smallest separation between the solitons again ending by a transition to oscillatory states through the Hopf bifurcation.",A method for constructing the Lax pairs for nonlinear integrable models is suggested. First we look for a nonlinear invariant manifold to the linearization of the given equation. Examples show that such invariant manifold does exist and can effectively be found. Actually it is defined by a quadratic form. As a result we get a nonlinear Lax pair consisting of the linearized equation and the invariant manifold. Our second step consists of finding an appropriate change of the variables to linearize the found nonlinear Lax pair. The desired change of the variables is again defined by a quadratic form. The method is illustrated by the well-known KdV equation and the modified Volterra chain. New Lax pairs are found. The formal asymptotic expansions for their eigenfunctions are constructed around the singular values of the spectral parameter. By applying the method of the formal diagonalization to these Lax pairs the infinite series of the local conservation laws are obtained for the corresponding nonlinear models.,Pattern Formation and Solitons,"Pattern formation and solitons in nonlinear sciences physics focuses on the study of spontaneous pattern formation in physical, biological, chemical, and related systems.

Strong thermal transport along polycrystalline transition metal dichalcogenides revealed by multiscale modelling for MoS2,Nodeless superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric LaRhSn,False,"Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent a large family of high-quality 2D materials with attractive electronic, thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique is currently the most reliable route to synthesis few-atomic layer thick and large-scale TMDs films. However, the effects of grain boundaries formed during the CVD method on the properties of TMDs nanomembranes have remained less explored. In this study, we therefore aim to investigate the thermal conduction along polycrystalline molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as the representative member of TMDs nanomembranes family. This goal was achieved by developing a combined atomistic-continuum multiscale method. In the proposed approach, reactive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to assess thermal contact conductance of diverse grain boundaries with various defects configurations. The effective thermal conductivity along the CVD grown polycrystalline and single-layer MoS2 was finally acquired by conducting finite element modelling. Insight provided by this investigation can be useful to evaluate the effective thermal transport along a wide variety of 2D materials and structures.","The superconducting order parameter of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor LaRhSn is investigated by means of low temperature measurements of the specific heat, muon-spin relaxation/rotation ($\mu$SR) and the tunnel-diode oscillator (TDO) based method. The specific heat and magnetic penetration depth [$\lambda(T)$] show an exponentially activated temperature dependence, demonstrating fully gapped superconductivity in LaRhSn. The temperature dependence of $\lambda^{-2}(T)$ deduced from the TDO based method and $\mu$SR show nearly identical behavior, which can be well described by a single-gap $s$-wave model, with a zero temperature gap value of $\Delta(0)=1.77(4)k_BT_c$. The zero-field $\mu$SR spectra do not show detectable changes upon cooling below $T_c$, and therefore there is no evidence for time-reversal-symmetry breaking in the superconducting state.",Materials Science,"Materials science in condensed matter physics focuses on the properties and behaviors of materials from a condensed matter perspective.

A multi-differential investigation of strangeness production in pp collisions with ALICE,Microscopic Analysis of Nuclear Quantum Phase Transitions in the N=90 region,False,"In these proceedings, two multi-differential analyses performed in pp collisions collected by the ALICE collaboration during the LHC Run 2 are presented. One investigates the dependence of strange particle production with multiplicity and effective energy, whereas the other clarifies how strangeness enhancement is correlated to the leading jet in the event. The results suggest that strangeness production at the LHC depends strongly on effective energy, and originates dominantly from the transverse region with respect to the leading jet direction.","The analysis of shape transitions in Nd isotopes, based on the framework of relativistic energy density functionals and restricted to axially symmetric shapes in Ref. \cite{PRL99}, is extended to the region $Z = 60$, 62, 64 with $N \approx 90$, and includes both $\beta$ and $\gamma$ deformations. Collective excitation spectra and transition probabilities are calculated starting from a five-dimensional Hamiltonian for quadrupole vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, with parameters determined by constrained self-consistent relativistic mean-field calculations for triaxial shapes. The results reproduce available data, and show that there is an abrupt change of structure at N=90 that can be approximately characterized by the X(5) analytic solution at the critical point of the first-order quantum phase transition between spherical and axially deformed shapes.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Resonances as Probes of Heavy-Ion Collisions at ALICE,Electromagnetic Observables in Few-Nucleon Systems,False,"Hadronic resonances serve as unique probes in the study of the hot and dense nuclear matter produced in heavy-ion collisions. Properties of the hadronic phase of the collision can be extracted from measurements of the suppression of resonance yields. A comparison of the transverse-momentum spectra of the phi(1020) meson and the proton (which have similar masses) can be used to study particle production mechanisms. Resonance measurements in pp collisions provide input for tuning QCD-inspired particle production models and serve as reference measurements for other collision systems. Measurements of resonances in p-Pb collisions allow nuclear effects in the absence of a hot and dense final state to be studied. The ALICE Collaboration has measured resonances in pp, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions. These measurements will be discussed and compared to results from other experiments and to theoretical models.","The electromagnetic probe is a very valuable tool to study the dynamics of few nucleons. It can be very helpful in shedding light on the not yet fully understood three-nucleon forces. We present an update on the theoretical studies of electromagnetic induced reactions, such as photo-disintegration and electron scattering off 4He. We will show that they potentially represent a tool to discriminate among three-nucleon forces. Then, we will discuss the charge radius and the nuclear electric polarizability of the 6He halo nucleus.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Nonlinear coupling of flow harmonics in heavy-ion collisions,Pauli resonance states in light nuclei: how they appear and how they can be eliminated,False,"Anisotropic flow coefficients beyond triangular flow receive important contributions from lower-order harmonics through nonlinear coupling. We present a theoretical framework which allows one to quantify the contribution induced by such nonlinear couplings to any flow harmonic of any order. We show the effectiveness of this formalism through an application to hexagonal flow, $V_6$. We study, in particular, the coupling of $V_6$ to triangular flow, $V_3$, in Pb+Pb collisions at $~\sqrt[]{s}=2.76$ TeV, using both Large Hadron Collider data and event-by-event hydrodynamic calculations.","Systematic analysis of parameters and properties of the Pauli resonance states are performed for light nuclei $^{6}$Li, $^{7}$Li, $^{8}$Be, $^{9}$Be and $^{10}$B, which are treated as two-cluster systems. The Pauli resonance states are redundant solutions of the resonating group method appearing when one try use more advanced description of the internal structure of interacting clusters. Our calculations are performed in a standard and advanced versions of the resonating group method. The standard version employs wave functions of many-particle shell model to describe internal motion of nucleons within each cluster. The advanced version is based on three-cluster resonating group method. As in the standard version, the internal wave functions of three clusters are approximated by wave functions of many-particle shell model model. However, in advanced version one of pair of clusters forms a bound state, and third cluster is considered to interact with such state. It is found that the Pauli resonance states in nuclei under consideration have energy between 11 and 46 MeV, and their widths vary from 8 keV to 6.7 MeV. Analysis of wave functions of Pauli resonance states and matrix elements of norm kernel allowed us to formulate an effective method for eliminating Pauli resonance states. It is demonstrated that this method effectively eliminate all determined the Pauli resonance states.",Nuclear Experiment,"Nuclear experiment in physics focuses on the areas of fundamental interactions, measurements at low- and medium-energy, as well as relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
